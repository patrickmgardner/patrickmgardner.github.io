PROPOSITION XVIII. <p>

<b>Possible Essence, fundamentally regarded, is really distinguished from existing Essence.</b><p>

This Thesis is clearly a mere Corollary of the doctrine concerning possibles, which has been established in the third Chapter of this book. For it was there demonstrated, that the real foundation of the concept of Possible Essence is the Divine Nature as imitable outside Itself; and the Divine Nature is really distinguished from all existing things.
