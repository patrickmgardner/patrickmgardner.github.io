<h2>Chapter IV. Possible and Existing Essence Contrasted.</h2><p>

NOTE. Again, in this Chapter, the inquiry is limited to finite Essence. Possible Essence is assumed as equivalent to <i>merely</i> Possible Essence. <p>

PROPOSITION XVII. <p>

<b>Possible Essence, formally regarded, is distinguished from existing Essence by real negative distinction, which is properly conceptual.</b><p>

THE FIRST MEMBER of this Thesis is sufficiently established by simply defining the term, <i>real negative distinction</i>. Such a distinction is said to exist between two members, one of which is real, the other purely conceptual; as e.g. between Being and not-Being, Something and nothing. As, therefore, Existing Essence is real, and Possible Essence formally considered is, (as has been shown in the third Chapter), purely logical; the distinction between the two is one of real negative distinction. <p>

THE SECOND MEMBER is equally plain. For, as distinction from nothing is no distinction; so, distinction from nothing real, is no real distinction. It must, consequently, be logical or conceptual merely.
