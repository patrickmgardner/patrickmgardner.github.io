PROPOSITION LXIV. <p>

<b>All Distinction of Being is either real or logical.</b> <p>

PROLEGOMENON. <p>

In all things that are anywise distinct from one another, there is a double element; to wit, the things themselves which are considered as distinct, and the Distinction which subsists between them. The former may not inappropriately be called the <i>material</i> part; the latter, the <i>formal</i> part, of Distinction. Now, the material part of Distinction, or the entities themselves, may be <i>logical</i> or <i>real</i>. If they are logical; the formal part, or the Distinction, may be after a manner <i>real,</i> or it may be <i>logical</i>. It is said, <i>after a manner real;</i> because, though there could not be an absolutely real Distinction between two or more merely logical entities, yet the Distinction may be such that, if the entities were real, <i>it</i> would be real. It may be said, therefore, to be <i>imitatively</i> real. Thus, the Distinction between <i>Species</i> and its <i>Definition</i> is logical; that between two <i>Species</i> under the same <i>Genus,</i> real in the sense explained; for the reason that they are mutually exclusive of each other. By some Doctors, when the material part is logical, the logical Distinction

is called an <i>extrinsic</i> logical Distinction; when the material part is real and the formal part logical, an <i>intrinsic</i> logical Distinction. According to the doctrine already established when we were occupied in determining the proper subject-matter of this Science, it is not the part of a metaphysician to concern himself with logical entities; save so far forth, as their investigation may conduce to a more complete and accurate knowledge of <i>real</i> Being. Accordingly, the question of <i>extrinsic</i> logical Distinctions will find no place in the present Article. <p>

And now for the DECLARATION of tbe Proposition. One real entity is not another real entity, either properly and in its own nature independently of any intellectual operation, or <i>improperly</i> and <i>denominatively,</i> by virtue alone of different concepts representative of that entity. In other words, the Distinction exists either in the nature of things between two or more entities physically separated or separable, such as is to be found between <i>James</i> and <i>Henry,</i> or between <i>the human soul</i> and <i>body;</i> or merely in the mind, which is capable of conceiving the same real entity under the form of different concepts, either logically or conceptually distinct. In the former case, the Distinction is <i>real;</i> in the latter, <i>logical</i>. (It would be as well to notice, that <i>logical</i> is used here generically, as including <i>conceptual,</i> --  where there is a real foundation for the Distinction, -- as well as logical <i>specific,</i> or <i>merely</i> logical, -- where there is no such foundation.) Furthermore, there is no middle  term. For either the entities, considered as distinct, are physically  separable, at least by the absolute Omnipotence of God; or they  are not. If the former, the Distinction is <i>real;</i> if the latter, it is  <i>logical</i>. <p>

NOTE I.  There is a peculiar kind of Distinction, which has been called by Doctors of the School real negative Distinction. It is supposed  to exist, -- to repeat that which has already found a place in these  pages, -- between two terms, of which one is a real entity, the  other a negation; whence the name. Thus, the Distinction between  <i>Being</i> and <i>not-Being</i> is said to be real negative Distinction. It is  said to be real, because it is metaphysically impossible that any thing could be <i>one</i> with its own simple negation; it is called  negative, for the reason already assigned. If, however, such Distinction is attentively considered, it will be found to be a mere logical

Distinction. For two supposed entities cannot be <i>physically</i> separable, unless they are <i>real</i> entities. Where one term is logical, the Distinction itself cannot be real. <p>

NOTE II. <p>

<i>Formal</i> Distinction, as it is called, or the Distinction of Form from Form, is sometimes real, sometimes conceptual. By Form is here understood some essential characteristic which determines a given entity; though such essential characteristic may be only partial. Thus, -- to illustrate the explanation, -- the <i>Animality</i> in <i>William</i> is really distinct from the <i>Animality</i> in Henry. So, <i>Animality</i> in a man is really distinct from <i>Animality</i> in a <i>worm</i>. But <i>Animality</i> in <i>William</i> is only conceptually distinct from <i>Intelligence</i> in the same. In like manner, the intuitive faculty, the faculty of memory, the reasoning, the abstractive faculty, are in man only conceptually distinct. In like manner, in God, Intellect and Will, Wisdom and Goodness, Essence and Existence, are all individually one; and are, consequently, only logically distinguished.
