<h1>Catholicism in the Middle Ages</h1>

<p>WHAT do we understand by Civilization? It is usually taken to mean the 
refinement of man in his social capacity. Whatever uplifts, cleanses, 
purifies, inspires man as a member of the common human family is held 
by all men to be civilizing. The word, if not the idea, comes to us 
from the masterful Roman people. They believed that their 
<i>civilitas</i>, or civilization, the sum total and the spirit of 
social progress attained in their city by their laws and language, 
their religion and philosophy of life, was unsurpassed, was the last 
and highest effort of mankind.</p>

<p>In this they erred; and we need no better proof than the remnants of 
their life that have come down to us in one way or another. But they 
erred in noble company, for before them the Egyptian, the Assyrian, and 
the Persian had shared the same conviction, as they have left the same 
historical proofs of their self-illusion in many a great monument, many 
a proud inscription. Even the Greek, whose civilization is so 
intimately related to that of the Romans, and <!-- pg 135 --> through 
them to us, was unable to protect and propagate directly the spirit and 
the institutions of his own admirable refinement. In all purely human 
work there is a response of death, a certain futility and emptiness, as 
a reminder by Nature of man's transitory character and functions.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, while the forms, the outer dress, as it were, of 
civilization, change from one epoch of time to another, there is 
forever common to all mankind an irrepressible trend, like a rising 
flame or a flowing current, that impels us to create and share common 
interests and common enjoyments, that calls forth common efforts for 
causes that are common and therefore higher than any or all of us. In 
the common gains or attainments we bring to the front the best and 
noblest that is in each one of us. In the common struggle we learn to 
admire and love the natural forces, gifts, opportunities, and 
institutions which have been the means of creating what each race, or 
people, or epoch calls its civilization. So the flag of one's 
fatherland arouses the holiest of natural passions, for it compresses 
into one cry, as it were, the whole life of a great and ancient people 
through many stirring centuries. So the tattered colors of the regiment 
whip the blood of the soldier into a rapid flow, for they <!-- pg 136 -
-> recall the vastness and complexity of the common efforts that 
culminated in the victories whose inscribed names are soaked with the 
blood of the bravest and best.</p>

<p>Civilization is indeed a constant strife, and he alone comprehends it 
well who looks on it from the view-point of conflict. Not one genuine 
gain of civilization but counts its martyrs; not one step upward in the 
history of mankind but is taken amid the protests and opposition of 
those whose individual or particular interests are assailed, or seem to 
be. Mankind itself, even collectively, is not exempt from the blunders 
and follies, the errors and weaknesses of the individual. A Socrates 
can sacrifice to Esculapius, and a Montezuma can preside over hecatombs 
of human victims. It is precisely this atmosphere and character of 
conflict that lend to the period we are about to deal with its greatest 
charm.</p>

<p>
I.</p>

<p>In the history of mankind, there is no more instructive, no more 
crucial, time than what we call the Middle Ages. Then the ancient 
civilization of Europe was overrun by the barbarism of the North and 
the East, and owed its preservation and resurrection, not to its own 
power and fasci<!-- pg 137 -->nation, not to the pity or needs of rude 
and fierce conquerors, but to the influence and authority of the 
Catholic Church. Roughly speaking, we may say that the Middle Ages are 
that period of one thousand years that opens with the overthrow of the 
imperial power of Rome in Central and Southern Europe about the year 
500 A.D. and closes with the discovery of America and the invention of 
printing, just before the year 1500. In that time, there is, in greater 
or lesser degree, one form of government, the feudal system, based on 
permanent warfare, upheld by a monopoly of the land, and the weakness 
of the central authority in every State. One race, the Teutonic, 
imposes its will on all the fair lands that were once the provinces of 
Rome -- Spain, Gaul, Britain, Helvetia, the Rhineland, Italy herself. 
Throughout Europe the warrior rules, and the public life is marked by 
all the virtues and vices of the camp or burg. With few exceptions, the 
civil power is held by an aristocracy, more or less open from below, 
more or less restrained by king or emperor, but always violent and 
proud. The habits and manners of daily life are yet largely those of 
the forest and the marsh and the sea whence the invaders came. It was 
many a long day before the English thane forgot that he was <!-- pg 138 
--> the son of Low Dutch pirates, or the Norman earl ceased to feel 
himself the descendant of men who had made a dozen kings to quake and 
emperors to do them homage. The Hidalgos of Spain, the Ritters of 
Germany, are long conscious that they hold their places by reason of 
the old Gothic and Suevic or Alemannic conquests. At the basis of this 
society there is always the antithesis of might and right, the strong 
and the weak, the brutal and ignorant against the refined and educated, 
the selfish and individual greed or need against the purposes and 
utilities of progressive society. When we look out over these ten 
centuries of human history, they come before us like the meeting of the 
turbulent sea with the waters of some majestic river, the Ganges or the 
Mississippi. On one side is the contribution of an orderly and 
regulated force, on the other the lawless impact of an elemental 
strength. The result is eddies and currents, islands and bars, reefs 
and shoals. A new and strange life develops along this margin of 
conflict between order and anarchy. All is shifting and changing, and 
yet, beneath all the new phenomena, goes on forever the original 
struggle between the river that personifies civilization and the sea 
that personifies the utter absence of the same. <!-- pg 139 -->So it 
was in the civil and secular world of the Middle Ages. There were 
indeed periods of advancement, stretches of sunshine in a gloomy and 
troubled climate, individuals and institutions of exceptional goodness. 
If the underlying barbarism of the civil life had its vices, it had 
also its virtues, that both pagan and Christian have agreed in 
praising. It had overrun Europe like a flood, but it brought with it a 
rich alluvial deposit of courage and ambition, the elasticity and ardor 
of youth, fresh and untainted hearts, an eagerness to know and to do, 
an astounding energy that was painful to the sybaritic society that 
suffered the domination of barbarism.</p>

<p>For an event of so great magnitude, it is wonderful how little we know 
of the circumstances of the fall of the Roman authority in the West. 
The civilization that up to the end was heir to all the art and 
philosophy of Greece, all the power and majesty of Rome, suffered 
shipwreck almost without a historian. Odds and ends of annals and 
chronicles, stray remarks apropos of other things -- these are all that 
are left to us of those memorable decades of the fifth century, when 
Rome saw her gates desecrated by one barbarian horde after another. Yet 
enough remains to show that it was the <!-- pg 140 -->Catholic Church 
which stood between her and utter extirpation, so great was the 
contempt and hatred of Goth and Vandal and Hun for the city that had 
been long the oppressor of the nations. Here a bishop turns away the 
wandering hordes from his town, there another encourages to vigorous 
resistance that is successful; here a holy virgin saves Paris from 
destruction, there an Italian bishop brings home a long procession of 
captives. Everywhere in this dark century that saw the old classic life 
enter on its decline, the Catholic bishop appears as the defender of 
the municipality and the people against every oppression. He also 
possesses a moral authority equally great with Roman and barbarian. 
Alone he is trusted by both powers, for he is the only social force 
left that is really unaffected by the collapse of the old world and the 
arrival of a new one. The bishop is the ambassador of emperor and 
people, as on that dread day in the middle of the century, when Leo the 
Great went out to Attila, on his way to Rome, and persuaded the great 
Hun to turn back with his half million savages and spare the Eternal 
City. As sorrow upon sorrow fell on the doomed cities and populations, 
the civil power gave way completely, and the ministers of religion were 
compelled to take <!-- pg 141 -->up a work foreign to their calling, 
and save such wreckage as they might of the administration, art, and 
literature of their common fatherland. They became the premiers of the 
barbarian kings, the codifiers of their laws, their factotums in all 
things, their intimate friends and counsellors. There is not a state in 
Europe, and all of them go back to thus time, that does not recognize 
among its real founders, the Catholic bishop before whom the original 
conquerors bowed. There is Clovis before Remigius, Theodoric before 
Epiphanius and Cassiodorus, the Burgundian king before Avitus, and so 
many others that it is needless to detail their names or deeds. I 
recall the facts only to show that the very bases of our Christian 
society, the very foundations of mediaeval Christendom, were laid by a 
long line of brave and prophetic bishops and priests, who saw at once 
in the barbarian conquerors future children of the Church and apostles 
of Christianity. On the very threshold, therefore, of the Middle Ages, 
the Catholic Church appears as the truest friend both of the old order 
that was going out, and the new one that was being ushered in amid the 
unspeakable horrors that always accompany the downfall of an ancient 
and highly wrought civilization.</p>

<p><!-- pg 142 --> II.</p>

<p>All civilization begins with the soil. What have been the relations of 
the Catholic Church to the soil throughout the Middle Ages? Everywhere 
man is a child of the soil. Mysteriously he issues from it. He lives on 
it and by it. He goes down one day to his appointed place in the mighty 
bosom of Mother Earth. No matter how complicated society may become, it 
is impossible that conditions should arise in which man can be 
otherwise than dependent upon the earth that God gave him for a 
sufficient and suitable sojourning lace. Institutions, laws, customs, 
and marners that sin against the God-given relations of man and the 
Eoil bear in them always the sure promise of death. Half, nay, nearly 
all the great events of history are directly traceable to the struggles 
for the soil, whether from within or without the State. The plebeians 
and the patricians of Rome create immortal principles of private law by 
reason of this very confict; the Roman State itself goes on the rocks 
because it neglected good lessons learned in its infancy. The contests 
of warlike shepherds in China precipitate masses of barbarian Goths and 
Huns <!-- pg 143 -->and Vandals on the Roman Empire and dislocate the 
social fabric that the genius and fortune and experience of a thousand 
years had built up. For another thousand years of feudal life the land 
is the only source and sign of wealth. The Middle Ages, economically, 
are that period of Western history when a few reaped the products of 
the earth, when the many bore the burden of the sowing, but at the 
reaping went empty-handed away.</p>

<p>The Catholic Church is too much the Mother Church of the poor and lowly 
and humble, too much the Spouse of the carpenter's Son, that great 
Friend of all who labor and are heavy burdened, not to hear forever in 
her heart the tender yet puissant cry, "I have pity on the multitude." 
The life of the soil is really in the labor that makes it bear fruit. 
Until man appeared the world was indeed a bright garden, but growing 
wild and untrimmed, all its powers sleeping as though under a spell 
within its bosom. This labor the Catholic Church has always sanctified 
and held up as a necessary and a blessed thing. Her Founder was 
accounted the son of a common laboring man, Himself a toiler at the 
bench. Her first missionaries were working-men -- fishermen, pub<!-- pg 
144 -->licans, a physician, a tent-maker. She, first and alone, 
uplifted on her banner the symbols of labor and declared them worthy 
and holy. All her early documents bear the praise of labor. All her 
earliest legislation enforces labor as a duty for all. But the duty of 
labor brings with it a corresponding right to the fruit and reward of 
labor, and here she came at once into contact with the existing 
conditions of society.</p>

<p>I shall say nothing of the relations of the Church to the soil under 
the pagan Roman Empire. Those three centuries were not unlike the three 
decades of the hidden life of Jesus, an epoch of divine education for 
her public life. But as soon as she is free we find her concerned about 
the treatment of the working-man in the great ranches or villas of the 
Roman nobles. No more underground prisons, no more stamping with hot 
irons the face that has been cleansed in the baptism of Christ, no more 
compelling of girls to go on the obscene vaudeville stage of antiquity, 
no more maiming or abusing of the slave. She opens vast refuges in 
every city for the poor and homeless driven off their estates by the 
growing monopoly in land. Every church door is a distributing <!-- pg 
145 -->place for the bread of the ensuing week. One quarter of the 
funds of every church goes to the relief of her poor. Before the empire 
fell one of her priests arose and wrote an immortal page that stands 
forever to show that it was the abuse of taxation that brought it low 
and not the right hand of the barbarian, which in more humane days she 
had always beaten down. Economically, the old Roman Empire was always 
pagan, even in the hands of Christian men. Its principles and methods 
of administration never changed. It was an omnipotent, omniscient 
bureaucracy, that learned nothing and forgot nothing, until one grim 
day the Cross went down before the Crescent on the dome of St. Sophia 
and the Leather Apron was hoisted above the waters of the Golden Horn. 
But in all those trying ages, every bishop's house was a court of 
appeal for the overburdened peasant, and the despotic lord or cunning 
middleman was very likely to hear in a summary way from Constantinople, 
or from the barbarian kings turned Christian. A bishop sat on the bench 
with the judges. He visited the prisons, his church had the right of 
asylum for poor debtors or oppressed men generally. He was recognized 
by the State as a natural-born <!-- pg 146 -->spokesman of the people 
in city and country. He was the last link between the old Roman society 
and the new world arising on its ruins. In his person, for he was 
nearly always the ablest man in the city, were gathered all the best 
traditions of law and procedure, of traditions and good customs. In the 
wreckage of the State he had saved, as it were, the papers, the family 
records, the registers, and the like, that in an hour of peace would 
enable order to be brought out of chaos by younger hands. Let any 
modern economist or lawyer read the letters of Gregory the Great and he 
will be astonished to see how this great Roman nobleman, who traced his 
ancestry back to the Caesars, and who had been himself governor of Rome 
at the end of the sixth century, treats the relations of the peasant 
and the soil. Without interfering with the theories of the day that did 
not concern him, he upholds in a long series of documents the just 
rights of his tenants on the four hundred farms that the Roman Church 
then owned in Sicily. He chides his agents for rackrenting and orders 
the excess to be given back. He provides for an adjustment of losses 
between the Church and the tenants. He writes to the emperor about 
false measure<!-- pg 147 -->ments and exactions. Were all the noble 
principles he promulgates to be put into modern English, it would be 
seen that this ancient Bishop of Rome had asserted thirteen hundred 
years ago, at the beginning of our modern world, the principles that 
are yet basic in any society of men that pretends to stand and work 
well, without convulsions or revolutions. Now, Gregory was only the 
head of the system; he was not the inventor of those principles. He 
recalls them to his Italian bishops as being the purest spirit of the 
gospel. If we want to know what they are we have only to read the 
magnificent encyclical of Leo XIII. on the condition of the working-
men. In it these principles are clothed in language scarcely different 
from that of his ancient predecessor.</p>

<p>These ancient bishops of the decadent empire and the incipient States 
of Europe compelled the great land-owners to build numerous little 
chapels on their estates. Thus arose around the homes of religion the 
little villages of France and Italy and Germany. It is no mere chance 
that causes the Catholic Church spire in these lands to rise from ten 
thousand hamlets. The hamlets grew up beneath its beneficent shadow. In 
those little chapels were told to <!-- pg 148 -->the noble and serf the 
truths of the gospel that gradually broke down the mediaeval servage. 
Before those little rural altars the gospel was first divided into 
sections as we read it to-day on Sundays. Then again yearly the bishops 
in synod taught the parish priests how to comment on it, how to apply 
it without fear of cringing. To-day it seems a small task to speak the 
truth before all, but one day, long ago, it required an abnormal moral 
courage for the son of a peasant to stand up before the owner of the 
great warlike castle on yonder peak and bid him cease from vexing, bid 
him live with one wife, bid him stop the rioting and dissipation by 
which he spent in one night the earnings of the estate for a year. 
Behind that poor semi-illiterate hind, dressed in the garments of a 
priest, there stood the bishop, and behind the bishop rose the powerful 
figure of the Church incarnate in the supreme Bishop at Rome. Countless 
times the thunderbolt flew from thence, straight and true, that laid 
low the awful pride and the satanic tenacity of some great Frank or 
some fierce Lombard lord. It was indeed the Catholic bishop who saved 
the peasants of Europe from the fifth to the eighth century. For three 
hundred years he was the <!-- pg 149 -->last court of appeal; he was 
the gospel walking among men; he was the only international force with 
power to execute its decrees. His cathedral was always in the heart of 
the city, and in its great doorway he sat regularly to judge justly and 
without price. His priests were usually the lawyers and notaries of the 
people. And on certain old Romanesque or Byzantine portals you may yet 
see in marble that lovely scene of the episcopal weekly tribunal. 
Around his house and in front of his church stretched the public 
square. He was the protection, therefore, of the little tradesman, the 
peasant, the pedler with his wares. To him came the pilgrim, the 
stranger, the wandering penitent. To him the ambassadors going east and 
west, the king on his annual round, the great nobles charged with the 
administration of justice or the collection of revenue. And when, after 
Pentecost, for example, or at Michaelmas, he gathered in annual synod 
his clergy from the villages and ranches and villas and castles, and 
stood at his throne, mitre on head and staff in hand, it did seem to 
all the assembled multitude, and it was in its own way true, that the 
Sun of Justice was shining among men, that every wrong would be 
redressed and <!-- pg 150 -->every sorrow smoothed over, so far as it 
lay in the public power to do so. It is not for nothing that the 
Catholic episcopate won its incredible authority over the people. Such 
historical phenomena have always an adequate cause. Right here it was 
three long centuries of intelligent and sympathetic protection of the 
people, at a time when the feudal law was a-forming and the benefit of 
Roman law was in abeyance.</p>

<p>All this time the old conditions of the Roman provinces of Europe were 
being deeply modified. Industry had been extinguished and commerce 
paralyzed by the first inroads of the barbarians. The east fell away 
from the west, whose jealous kings tolerated little intercourse with 
Constantinople. The loveliest lands of France and Italy went without 
culture, and soon forests grew where palaces had lifted their proud 
fronts. The wild beasts wandered among the baths and porticoes and 
temples of the ancients, and the very names of towns that were once 
echoed beyond the Ganges were forgotten. Then arose another mighty 
force of the Catholic Church, the monks of St. Benedict. Long while 
only laymen, subject to the local bishop and controlled by him, they 
grew very numerous in time. Their rule was an admirable thing for <!-- 
pg 151 -->the social needs of the day. It inculcated equally the labor 
of the field and the labor of the brain, and so during this period and 
long after, all Europe was overrun by the children of that good man 
whose mortal remains repose above the rushing Anio amid the sublime 
scenery of Subiaco. The Roman Bishop took them under his especial 
protection, and together they formed a religious power that worked for 
good in every direction without any thought of self-advancement or any 
conflict of an unavoidable character. They chose usually for a home the 
waste and desert spots of Europe. Soon the forest was again thinned out 
and crops were again planted. Priest and brother, the educated man and 
the common laborer, went down into the field together, and worked all 
day in silence side by side. They built the ditches, they bridged the 
streams, they laid the necessary roads; they increased the area of 
arable land in every decade, and thereby drove out the noxious wild 
beasts; draining and irrigation on a large scale were carried on by 
them. Walls and fences and grauges arose on every little estate that 
they had created out of nothing. The peasant, half barbarian, learned 
from them the traditions of old Roman agriculture, for <!-- pg 152 --
>these men were often the best born and best educated men of the time. 
They leased to the peasant at a ridiculous rent and in real permanency 
the soil that they had themselves created. His children found 
employment in their kitchens and barns. One day the parents would lead 
their brightest boy to the abbey altar, where his little fist would be 
wound up in the altar cloth as a sign that they gave him to St. 
Benedict. Thus he would enter the order as a novice, to die My Lord 
Abbot of ten thousand acres, or Archbishop of Cologne, or perhaps Pope 
of Rome. <i>There</i> is one true source of modern democracy that ever 
open door of the Church by which throughout the Middle Ages the highest 
honor and emolument were ever open to the lowliest and poorest.</p>

<p>In those old days there were few or no cities. With the exception, 
perhaps, of Northern Italy, the old municipalities of the great Roman 
provinces, with all their traditions of order and justice, had been 
submerged. The collective life was everywhere a tender growth nourished 
by the Church. Its beginnings were often after the following fashion: -
-</p>

<p>Over against the castle or burg of the local lord she set the little 
church or the small mon<!-- pg 153 -->astery. These, too, became 
proprietors, and on their estates the peasantry could see other 
principles of government than those of the rapacious feudal lord. It 
was an old saying in the Middle Ages that it was a good thing to dwell 
beneath the crozier. As a fact, the greenest fields and the richest 
slopes, the best vineyards, the best kept forests and fisheries, were 
those of bishop or abbot. Here religion forbade waste and riot, and 
education brought to their cultivation much knowledge handed down from 
the ancients. Though without wives and children, these great 
ecclesiastical lords, always elective, held a kind of a dead-hand over 
their estates. Thus were secured perpetuity of tenure, continuous 
culture of the fields, equality of rents, new tracts of reclaimed 
lands, mildness of administration, and a minimum of expense in the 
conduct of vast properties. The classical studies broadened their views 
and humanized bishop and priest and monk. The meditation on the gospel, 
the example of countless holy monks and hermits, the daily service of 
God at the majestic altars of some basilica or Romanesque church 
softened their hearts. Those men and women whom the bishop or the abbot 
daily blessed, who brought in their woes with <!-- pg 154 -->their 
tithes, were his tenants, perhaps for many generations; thus there 
arose a certain fraternal intimacy between the most powerful men in the 
State and the humblest serf who delved on the hillside or tended sheep 
along the uplands. Whole sections of Europe were in this way reclaimed, 
or for the first time cultivated. Prussia, Southern Germany, most of 
the Rhineland, the greater part of Switzerland, great tracts of 
Southern Italy and Sicily, of Norway and Sweden, are the immediate 
creation of these churchmen. If we would have some idea of the duties 
of a mediaeval bishop we should have to compare him with the president 
of some great railroad and double that with many of the duties of the 
mayor of a city and add thereto the responsibilities of teacher and 
preacher.</p>

<p>
III.</p>

<p>The States of the Middle Ages were almost purely agricultural. Yet even 
in such States problems of production and distribution arose. The 
population increased, wants multiplied, war and travel and awakening 
knowledge roused curiosity and desire. The bishop's house first, and 
then the monastery, was the great nucleus <!-- pg 155 -->of social life 
in the Middle Ages. Around the cathedral that the bishop built, perhaps 
in some lonely spot, if he was a missionary, or on the site of the old 
public buildings, if he dwelt in a once Roman town, gathered all kinds 
of workmen -- tillers of the field, the weavers of cloth, the builders 
of houses, the decorators of the cathedral, the workers in linen and 
embroidery. Here were to be found the stone mason, the blacksmith, the 
joiner, the carpenter, the gold and silversmith, every artificer, 
indeed, for the little community. We see at once that all the germs of 
a city life are here. Indeed, this is the origin of a multitude of 
European cities. The day will come when fierce conflict will arise 
between the bishops and the serfs emancipated and enriched, the latter 
claiming corporate cognition and a municipal constitution, freedom from 
imposts, and the like; the former pointing to the fact that all they 
had was a benefit of the Church. There are some kinds of justice so 
complicated that time alone can grant them. And so in the end the 
bishop lost his control and the cities won legal recognition. 
Similarly, the monasteries were centres of consumption and 
distribution. The revival of the cloth trade in England in the twelfth 
century owes very much to the consump<!-- pg 156 -->tion of black and 
gray cloth by the monks and the nuns, and, indeed, was long in their 
hands. The preservation and protection of the culture of the grape, the 
viniculture of the Middle Ages, was almost entirely dependent on the 
immense multitude of churches, chapels, and altars. The minor arts, 
like delicate work in silver and gold, in ivory and wood, embroideries 
and tapestries, were kept alive by the constant need of new church 
furniture.</p>

<p>In those days men lived much alone in castles or widely scattered 
hamlets. The annual fair with its products from all parts of the world 
was held under church auspices, about the monastery or in front of the 
cathedral. The wares of east and west were there hawked about; the 
traveller and the pilgrim hurried thither; the legal needs of the 
peasants -- wills, marriages, contracts -- were attended to; distant 
relatives met one another; all the refining duties of hospitality were 
exercised. And above it all arose the holy and benignant figure of 
Mother Church. The fair was opened with all the solemnities of the 
liturgy, and the fair itself was known as "The Mass” of St. Michael, 
<i>e.g.,</i> or of Our Lady. Indeed, the great book-fair of Leipzig is 
still called "The Mass of the Books."</p>

<p><!-- pg 157 -->Thus, throughout those remote times both the monastery 
preserved the germs of them would have utterly general ignorance and 
barbarism of the lay life. It is to them that we owe directly the 
preservation of all the social arts and professions. how many reflect 
when they enter an apothecary shop that it is the outcome of the 
"infirmary" of the monastery where the simples and drugs were kept that 
were needed for the use of the inmates or the serfs, and later on the 
peasants of the abbey. The monks copied out the old medical 
manuscripts, treasured up and applied much homely domestic traditions 
of a better day, and, to say the least, were as useful in handing down 
Greek medical practice as the Arabs were in transmitting its theory. 
Every monastery had its brother devoted to the sick, whose practical 
skill was often very great. While in Italy, both north and south, there 
surely lingered no little scientific medicine of the past, in the west 
of Europe the monks were, to a very great extent, the generous 
physicians of the rude and uncultured populations; memories of those 
days still hang about the cloisters of Italy, and those who have lived 
there long remember how often a rude dentistry <!-- pg 158 -->is 
gratuitously practised by some good Capuchin, how often the fever-
stricken boy of the Campagna throws himself at the entrance of the 
first cloister, how the women of the hamlet get from the nuns of the 
neighborhood the simple remedies they need. When we pass by some 
brilliantly lighted window and see exposed Chartreuse, Benedictine, and 
the like, we may remember that these sweetened liqueurs are antique 
recipes of mediaeval monks, originally meant for uses of health. 
Convents still exist out of the Middle Ages, like the Certosa at 
Florence and the Carmelites of the same old town, that were, and 
perhaps are yet, practically the dispensaries of the city. Indeed, one 
might add a page to the famous lecture of Wendell Phillips on the "Lost 
Arts," were he to recount the benefits conferred on the medical 
sciences by the devotion of the medheval clergy to the plain people. 
Only the other day, in reading Ian MacLaren's touching stories in the 
"Bonnie Brier Bush," I was led to reflect how much silent heroism of 
the same kind was practised in the mediaeval times, when a village 
doctor was unheard of, and the only available skill lay down in the 
valley or up on the tall crag where the men of God spent their innocent 
and benefi<!-- pg 159 -->cent days. Thus, whatever path of history or 
facts we tread backward for thirteen or fourteen centuries, we shall 
always find that the only stanch and loyal friend of the poor man was 
the Catholic priest; that all the useful and indispensable arts and 
professions of social life were gathered up by him out of the great 
wreck of Graeco-Roman life, or created anew amid the turbulence and 
lawlessness of barbarism; that law and medicine found in him a humble 
but a useful bridge by which they were rescued from the flood of 
oblivion and ruin; that the homely utilities of the soil, of food and 
drink, of clothing, the more complicated processes of production and 
distribution, were very largely dependent on him in all parts of 
Europe. At the top notch of his estate he was bishop or abbot, at the 
bottom poor parish priest or monk, -- but ever he was a friend of the 
people, and he earned their gratitude by an anonymous devotion, a 
nameless self-sacrifice, that covered one thousand years of the infancy 
of our modern states and was really their period of gestation and 
nursing.</p>

<p>While the Church was developing among the youthful nations of Europe 
the notion of the <!-- pg 160 -->common weal, the higher good of the 
commonwealth, she was also creating another entirely new institution, 
the Christian Law of Nations, or what is known to-day as International 
Law. The old Roman law did indeed recognize, gradually, a certain 
universal province of general rights, but it was only in the domain of 
private law, of the relations between one individual and another, such 
as contracts and obligations, wills and judgments, and the like; of a 
public law applicable to all peoples, higher than all and eminently 
fair to all, it had not the slightest inkling, and has left us no 
trace. Rome acknowledged no equal before the bar of mankind. The only 
civilization that ever withstood her, the old Persian, she pursued and 
harried to the death. Perhaps in that dread hour, when the grim fanatic 
Arab arose in his stirrup above the prostrate bodies of Roman and 
Persian, it dawned upon both that they would better have arbitrated 
their pretensions, but it was too late. On the dial of time no power 
can turn back the solemn finger of history. It was otherwise with the 
Catholic Church in the West. She was the mother and nurse of a whole 
brood of young and ardent peoples, full of high and vague impulses, 
naturally jealous of one another, but <!-- pg 161 -->also mutually 
respectful of the great holy power that they felt was lifting them 
steadily toward the light. In their infancy their first missionaries 
had been sent by Rome, and bore aloft their authority from the central 
see of Christendom. In time one agent of Rome, after another appeared 
to allay the fires of domestic hatred and revenge, to put bounds to 
ambition, to compel the execution of treaties, to protect the injured 
who were without redress. Often these men were of any nationality; 
whatever shrewd head offered itself, whatever experience of mankind was 
at hand, Rome accepted. Every kingdom and great family in Europe 
received and welcomed these men. Every decade of the Middle Ages is 
filled with their good deeds. They represent a central authority, 
entirely moral and resting on personal conviction of its •	sanctity. 
They appeal to the common law of the gospel and the general customs of 
Christian life and experience. They brought to their tasks a suavity of 
manner and a persistency of method that the lay world admired 
instinctively. The opposition they could not break down they turned. 
Peace was their object as war was the purpose of the feudal world. In 
time they created an unwritten code that governed the <!-- pg 162 --
>world, the life-giving centre of which was the Person of Jesus Christ 
in His gospel enlightening and soliciting mankind to follow Him, the 
Prince of Peace, to beat the sword into the ploughshare. At a later 
date, Hugo Grotius, Puffendorf, and other learned lawyers organized in 
detail this mediaeval institution; but it existed in practice long 
before them, and had long borrowed all its certainty of action from the 
Catholic Church. Only forty years ago, on the eve of the Vatican 
Council, David Urquhart wrote his famous "Letter of a Protestant to 
Pius IX.," begging him to declare again and formulate the old 
Pontifical Law of Nations, that nothing else would arrest the bloody, 
inhuman practices of the slave trade, the opium trade, and all the 
other infamous arts by which the strong white races were waging a 
hellish war against the weaker colored ones. Only very lately there met 
at The Hague in international conference the representatives of nearly 
all the civil powers of the earth to promote universal peace, but the 
representative of Leo XIII., though invited by Russia and ardently 
desired by the Queen of Holland, was not allowed to enter. What good 
can ever come of such proceedings? They are fantastic and visionary, 
<!-- pg 163 -->to say the least. It is the play of Hamlet with the 
noble Dane left out. A universal peace is a mockery so long as 
religious convictions do not dominate the ancient and natural impulses 
of selfishness, public and private, the cruel leonine policy of the 
world from Sargon to Napoleon.</p>

<p>

<p>It is a commonplace saying that there is no social progress possible 
without the recognition of authority in the State, and a respectful 
submission to its due and licit exercise. But of what avail is all this 
if there be no habitual discipline in the minds and hearts of men? It 
is the creation of this docile temper, this <i>trained submission to 
just law and custom,</i> that is one of the great glories of the 
Catholic Church. The modern world, in as far as it possesses this 
benefit, inherits it from her. A century of wild and incoherent efforts 
to base social obedience on any other lines than those she preaches has 
resulted in anarchy, or a practical appeal to her to help control the 
masses from whose hearts the balancing ideas of God, future 
retribution, sin, immortality, were driven by every ingenious means 
that could be devised. Neither Plato nor <!-- pg 164 -->Aristotle, 
neither Zeno nor Cicero nor Seneca, were able to establish a code of 
principles that would command the willing and affectionate acceptance 
of all men amid all the changing circumstances of life. Only Jesus 
Christ could do that. Hence His gospel is not only the noblest 
revelation of God to man, but also a political document of the highest 
rank, as the centuries to come will most certainly demonstrate. 
Throughout the Middle Ages the Catholic Church was the sole recognized 
interpreter of this gospel. Her decisions were law. Her comments were 
final. She did not call on men to obey a human will; it was the divine 
figure and will of Jesus that she held up before men. It was not by 
preaching herself or her achievements that she compelled the unwilling 
submission of the most violent men the world has seen, men in whose 
blood the barbarian strain was still hot and arrogant. Let any one read 
the great "Papal Letters" of the Middle Ages, the letters of Gregory I. 
to King Ethelbert, of Gregory VII. to Henry IV. of Germany, of 
Alexander III. to Henry II. of England, of Innocent III. to all the 
potentates of Europe, and the magnificent letters of the nonagenarian 
Gregory IX. to Frederick II., and he will be as<!-- pg 165 -->tounded 
at the richness and abundance of pure gospel teaching, at the cogency 
of the texts, at the vigor and apostolic candor of their application. 
Judges and prophets, bishops and apostles, -- these men speak as man 
never spoke before. And when their utterances were heralded in a few 
weeks all over Europe by the swiftest processes then known to man, the 
innocent looked up and rejoiced, the oppressed breathed easier, those 
who hungered and thirsted for justice had their desire fulfilled. The 
tyrant shook on his throne and all the ministers of religion felt that 
an invincible force had been infused into them. The moral battle had 
been won; let gross might do its worst. Kings of every nation quailed 
before those dread spiritual arrows; minor potentates stifled their 
evil passions for very fear of Rome; the unholy and impure let go the 
estates that they had robbed, either from the weak or from the Church; 
the usurer lifted his hand from the throat of his victim; the orphans' 
rights were vindicated and the widows' portion restituted. The holy law 
of monogamous marriage, of one man to one woman, was successfully 
defended; kingdoms were risked, and one day lost, for the sake of a 
principle. To all the sacredness of life was declared again and again 
<!-- pg 166 -->-- "Thou shalt not kill" -- neither thy neighbor in 
unjust violence, nor thyself as God's own, nor the child in the womb. 
In a century of savage anarchy she declared the famous Truce of God 
that practically prevented warfare for more than half the year. Her 
altars were always places of refuge against hasty and unjust vengeance. 
She forbade any one to mount the steps of those altars whose hand was 
stained with the blood of his fellow-man. In that long night of storm 
and conflict she was everywhere the White Angel of Peace, everywhere, 
like the Valkyries, a presence hovering over the multitudinous scene of 
battle, but not like them an urger of death -- rather the vicarious 
voice of God, His gentle spouse, bidding the hell of angry selfishness 
subside appealing, in season and out of season, to the conscience of 
mankind, its natural probity, above all to the love and the will of the 
Crucified One.</p>

<p>And so her own law grew, -- men called it in time the Canon Law, -- 
<i>i.e.</i> the law made up of the rules and regulations established by 
the authority of the Church. She disdained no human help and she loaned 
her strength to many a humane and good measure. But the substance of it 
all is the gospel; the spirit of it <!-- pg 167 -->is one of peace, of 
friendly composition and arbitration where possible; its very 
punishments have -- what was unknown to the laws of mankind before her 
-- a medicinal or healing character. Hitherto men were punished as a 
revenge of society for transgressing its collective will. Now men are 
punished that they may enter into themselves and be enlightened, and 
seeing, be made to walk as straight as they see; that is, be corrected.</p>

<p>Think of this legislation gradually spreading over all Europe from 
Sicily to Iceland, accepted as a quasi-divine code by all, and one sees 
at once what a stern but enduring discipline was imposed on men's 
hearts. Obedience was hard, but it was useful. It was humiliating, but 
it cleansed and comforted. It was painful, but it made men Godlike, 
since it was exercised to imitate and please Him who had first given 
the most splendid example of obedience. The Lombard Gastaldo at Friuli, 
and the Duke at Spoleto, the Frank Comes at Tours or Limoges, the 
Exarch at Ravenna, the Herzog in the Marches, all looked on and 
wondered and trembled at the popular submission to one weak man's will. 
For the first time moral dignity prevailed, and the authoritative 
sentence of the <!-- pg 168 -->successor of the Fisherman had more 
weight than the laws of a dozen kings. This was a great step, for it 
lifted the administration of justice out of and beyond the sphere of 
the personal and temporary into a high and serene atmosphere. It made 
the face of the judge to shine with a light reflected from heaven. It 
gave a kind of immortality to every utterance. It was like a new 
stringer laid on the fair and holy walls of the temple of justice. The 
decisions of one pope were sacred to his successor, and the wicked had 
the assurance that there was no reopening of their career before a 
tribunal that had judged them by the law of God.</p>

<p>Such an authority, sacred and intangible by reason of long and useful 
services to European society, could deal with all civil authorities on 
the highest level. It had nothing to gain from flattery and nothing to 
fear from their ill-will. It had known the gloom of the Catacombs, the 
turbulent and selfish fondness of the first Christian emperors, the 
whims and vagaries of the barbarous nations turned Christian. It is no 
exaggeration to say that the civil authority of the Middle Ages is the 
disciple of the Church. It learned from her the nature, scope, and 
spirit of authority. It got through her the most <!-- pg 169 --
>monumental expression of that authority, the immortal law of Rome. It 
got from her a higher and more useful concept of punishment. It learned 
from her a hundred uses of authority that were unknown before. It 
learned how to temper severity with mildness; how to restrain the ardor 
of justice by equity and prudence; how to insist on the written 
evidence and to preserve the records; how to surround justice with the 
due solemnity, and to grant to all concerned those proper delays that 
are needed to prevent the triumph of wrong through error, ignorance, or 
chance. Many of these things are, indeed, the legacies of the Roman law 
of procedure. But we must remember that centuries before the Roman law 
was taught in the schools of Europe it was the law that the Church and 
her clergy governed by, and by which they governed themselves in their 
synods and trials. Its procedure was made her own from the beginning 
and through her entered the chanceries and justice-halls of all Europe.</p>

<p>Whatever was the actual belief of Shakespeare, his genius was certainly 
Catholic in the largest sense. He has always the true philosophic note 
when lie touches her institutions. And so his bishops are the 
embodiment of law and <!-- pg 170 -->order. The principles of justice, 
the equity of war and peace, the nice points that affect the king's 
conscience, are decided by them. In "Henry V.," the king invokes the 
judgment of the bishops as to the moral character of his contemplated 
expedition against France.</p>

<p>"My learned lord, we pray thee to proceed, And justly and religiously 
unfold Why the law Salique that they have in France Or should or should 
not bar us in our claim. * * * * * * * *</p>

<p>And we will hear, note and believe in heart That what you speak is in 
your conscience wash'd As pure as sin in baptism." -- Act I., Scene 1.</p>

<p>The whole trend of public opinion in the Middle Ages was so 
overwhelmingly in this sense that it would have seemed an anachronism 
to have made the bishops of England assume an attitude different from 
what they had always held in ages gone by. So, too, in the Holy Roman 
Empire of the German Nation that theoretically dominated the political 
situation in Europe, the chancellor of the empire was always the 
Archbishop of Trier, and as such was the emperor's spiritual adviser in 
all that pertained to justice or equity in public affairs or 
enterprises. In other words, the great States of Europe grew from 
infancy to manhood under <!-- pg 171 -->the solemn and public tutelage 
of the Catholic Church. What is good and lasting in their government 
they owe to her; what is faulty and imperfect to their own inordinate 
ambitions.</p>

<p>The greatest public act that could fall to a churchman to perform in 
the Middle Ages was the anointing and coronation of a king. It is among 
the solemn acts reserved to a bishop, and as such is found in the Roman 
Pontifical. In one of the great prayers said over the new king, the 
Catholic Church has herself given the character, measure, and spirit of 
the civil duties of a regent of the people. It is almost a summary of 
her own career throughout the shifting and difficult circumstances of 
mediaeval life.</p>

<p>
VI.</p>

<p>Such a power as the Catholic Church, deeply rooted in history and in 
the hearts of all the nations of Europe, had necessarily a more than 
ordinary influence on the <i>social life of the people</i> and the 
institutions in which it manifested itself. I cannot do more than touch 
summarily on some important points. Those institutions that affect 
woman are fundamental in every society. With <!-- pg 172 -->an instinct 
both true and keen, the Catholic Church, at the break-up of the old 
Greek and Roman world, set herself to protect the weaker sex. It was 
now a world in which the example of the strong and the rich was all 
contagious. Bravely and persistently she resisted the attempts of the 
aristocracy from emperor and king downward to introduce polygamy. As 
the great nobles grew independent they grew restless under the 
restraint imposed upon ordinary men and asserted for themselves 
immunity from the law of the gospel. But. they found in the popes and 
the Catholic clergy, generally, a wall of brass that they essayed in 
vain to overthrow. The history of her marriage legislation, of her 
dealing with divorce, is one of the proudest pages in the life of the 
mediaeval Church. In every nation of Europe the battle had to be fought 
over and over again, and always with the same result, "Thou shalt not." 
We have yet, for example, the admirable letters written by Innocent 
III. to Ingelberge, the repudiated wife of Philip Augustus. They 
furnish a sufficient commentary on the long catalogue of royal 
matrimonial causes that were ever before the Roman court through the 
Middle Ages. The impediments that she <!-- pg 173 -->placed to certain 
marriages had each its own justification in history, in the relations 
with the civil power, or in that sure instinct of what was for the 
welfare of the people that I have already referred to. Thus the 
impediment of close relationship acted very efficaciously in preventing 
the accumulation of land and power in the hands of a few families, not 
to speak of other useful consequences. It must be remembered that, as 
to those impediments that she created by positive enactment or by 
hallowing custom, she must be judged from the view-point of the times 
and the circumstances. Apropos of the transmission of wealth, had the 
mediaeval clergy been a married clergy, the wealth of Europe would have 
passed to their children, their great benefices would have been 
hereditary, and instead of an humble class of men rising by their own 
efforts to the highest rank, we should have seen the great prizes of 
the ecclesiastical life handed down by the laws of human affection, 
with the invariable decay of every ecclesiastical virtue and the 
spiritual ruin of the European population.</p>

<p>If the Church built high the barrier about woman in some directions, in 
others she left her a freedom unknown to the ancients and opened <!-- 
pg 174 -->to her a career of extraordinary utility. No one might coerce 
her into marriage; the cloister was ever open. Only those who know how 
uncertain the perpetual turbulence of the Middle Ages made the 
condition of woman, how sad the life of the widow, the orphan, the 
desolate maiden, can appreciate the benefit that these holy refuges 
were to women in this stormy period. Woman governed freely such 
institutions, and when they arose to prominence, her position was only 
less enviable than that of a queen. As abbess of a great mediaeval 
monastery, she disposed of many and vast estates and revenues, and 
enjoyed in her own person the highest distinctions of Church and State. 
In marriage the freedom of her consent was especially safeguarded; her 
position and rights were the same as those of the husband, and if she 
was inferior in what pertained to the disposition of property, it must 
not be forgotten that mediaeval life was in many respects different 
from our own, that man alone could bear the burdens of life as it was 
then lived. The bishop's court in the Middle Ages was another benefit 
to woman. Usually it was the court for wills and testaments, and well 
it was, for the bishop was naturally the father of the helpless and the 
lowly.</p>

<p><!-- pg 175 -->Of two other conditions of life I shall say but one word 
-- the poor and the slave. So long as a monastery existed, no poor man 
could go hungry, and the duty of giving to the hungry and the poor was 
looked on everywhere as the holiest of all. War, pestilence, famine, 
worked their ravages, it is true, but in ordinary life the hungry and 
starving poor were rare in mediaeval Europe. Nor was this accomplished 
by statute law, nor with painful humiliation, but in love, for Jesus' 
sake, because He, too, had been a poor man; because the poor man bore 
the likeness and image of the Creator even as his richer brother; 
because, after all, the rich man was only the steward of his wealth and 
not its absolute owner. As for slavery, the Church did not formally 
abolish it, but it was incompatible with her doctrine and life. It 
gradually lapsed into servage; the serf was attached to the soil, a 
great blessing for him. He was often the Church's own man, and so he 
gradually merged into the free peasant, very largely through the agency 
of local churches, only too anxious to preserve on their lands the same 
families, with their knowledge of the soil and their loyalty to the 
owners.</p>

<p>As to money itself and its functions, the <!-- pg 176 -->mediaeval 
Church knew not our wonderful development of industry and commerce. It 
was an agricultural world, and money did not seem productive in itself. 
Usury was the supremest hardship for the poor, as it is yet felt in 
purely agricultural lands like Russia and India. It was forbidden under 
the severest penalties, and out of sympathy with the multitudes that 
would otherwise have suffered incredibly in a time when their little 
bit of land, their crops, and their implements were all that nine out 
of ten poor men could ever hope to own. As to the uses of wealth 
itself, the ideas of the Middle Ages were thoroughly humane, even 
grandiose. Surplus wealth was not man's, but God's. The owner was the 
steward, the administrator, and he was bound, after providing for the 
suitable support of his own, according to their estate in life, to 
bestow it in other good works. Moreover, thereby he could atone while 
yet alive for his shortcomings; he could further the relief of the 
poor, the weak, and friendless; he could be a helper of God in the 
government of this world; he could root out the ugliest of all social 
cancers, the cancer of ignorance; he could elevate to God's glory a 
noble temple; he could provide the sweet boon of education for those 
who would <!-- pg 177 -->never know its uses had not some generous soul 
been moved by such ideas. So common were these views that it was seldom 
a man or woman died without making some provision for the poor, for 
religion, for education. These moneys in turn flowed back into the 
community, and a perpetual exchange of good offices went on between the 
individual and the institution his generosity either created or 
sustained. So much money was given to education in Germany just before 
the Reformation that Martin Luther used to say it was almost impossible 
for a child to go ignorant under the papacy. So education, 
architecture, the fine arts, the social needs, were forever provided 
for by the overflowing treasury of popular gift, and the Catholic 
people in turn escaped the danger of idealizing their wealth and 
hoarding it too jealously against a future that they had no means of 
controlling. Thus, for instance, arose countless grammar schools in 
Scotland and England that were so numerous before the Reformation that 
the poorest boy could get a classical education in his own town and 
thereby enter the clergy. In Germany, France, and Italy, a similar 
education was to be had with almost the same ease, and that meant in 
those days the open door to office, preferment, <!-- pg 178 -->and 
wealth. Countless associations were endowed for the care of the poor, 
the burial of the dead, the dowering of poor girls, and the relief of 
every form of misery. If men made money largely, they spent it 
generously and intelligently. There was, perhaps, no time in the 
history of mankind, not even our own last few years, when men devoted 
to public uses so large a portion of their wealth. Not the least cause 
of it was the Catholic doctrine of the utility of good works for the 
welfare of the soul. Old churches were repaired; new ones were built 
all over Europe. Indeed, both Dr. Janssen and Dom Gasquet have slmwn, 
not only that the generosity of the fifteenth century was as great 
proportionately as that of any other age of the Church, but that it was 
extremely popular in kind, <i>i.e.</i> that down to the eve of the 
Reformation the people generally accepted the mediaeval view of the 
uses of money, notably for the common good. Shakespeare, who is so 
often the perfect echo of mediaeval thought and temper, puts into the 
mouth of the good Griffith as the best praise of the fallen Woolsey 
that he had built two noble schools for the education of youth, -- a 
grammar school and a university college: --</p>

<p><!-- pg 179 -->Ever witness for him Those twins of learning that he 
reared in you Ipswich and Oxford I one of which fell with him, 
Unwilling to outlive the good he did it; The other unfinished yet so 
famous, So excellent in art, and still so rising That Christendom shall 
ever speak his virtue."</p>

<p>-- "Henry VIII., Act IV., Scene 1.</p>

<p>
VII.</p>

<p>In the early Middle Ages the sense of the common weal was very 
imperfect. The Wandering Nations had developed the kingship through 
long and permanent conflicts, first among themselves, and then with 
Rome. But we see on all sides among them the rudest and most original 
independence. Here the great unity and centralization of the Church 
were as models to the State, that little by little arose to a similar 
concept. We have only to follow, for instance, the history of France 
from the days of Gregory of Tours to the foundation of the Capetian 
monarchy, to see how the churchmen contributed to the unification and 
solidarity of that great State. So, too, in England, the separate 
little kingdoms are brought ever closer together under the influence of 
Canterbury, its bishops, its synods, and the general unity of 
ecclesiastical life that was <!-- pg 180 -->there constantly visible 
since the time of St. Augustine. The mixed synods and councils of the 
early Middle Ages in England, Germany, France, Spain, were also a 
training school for the lay governors of society. They learned from the 
better educated ecclesiastics how to conduct popular assemblies with 
something more than the rude simplicity of their German forefathers by 
the Rhine or the Elbe.</p>

<p>They learned, as we have seen, the use of written records, the patient 
sustaining of contradiction, the yielding to the majority, the power of 
eloquence and learning. But they learned something holier still -- to 
look on public life from a moral point of view, to consider their 
offices as a trust from God, to become familiar with the idea that all 
power was from God and not from their great spears and their strong 
arms. Little by little generations of rulers were formed who owned 
enlightened consciences and listened to them, instead of the wild 
passions that were once their sole guides. Far deeper and more 
immediate than the influences of Rome and Greece on the modern state 
are the Christian influences. These are original and organic, the 
former academic and secondary. Later, indeed, the <!-- pg 181 -->common 
missionary enterprises, the opposition to Islam, the Crusades, bound 
all Christendom together in links of common sacrifice and ideals that 
could nevermore be forgotten.</p>

<p>I have already called attention to the signal services rendered by the 
Church in all that pertains to the administration of justice, the 
cornerstone of human society. In the preservation of the Roman 
procedure, the new views of the nature and uses of punishment as a 
"medicinalis operatio," in the obstacle that the right of asylum set 
against unjust vindictive haste, in the introduction of written 
evidence, she ‘saved some admirable old elements and added some new 
ones to the civil life of European peoples.</p>

<p>The <i>sanctity of oaths</i> was insisted on by her, and the utmost 
horror of perjury inculcated. In the great mediaeval veneration for the 
relics of the saints and martyrs and confessors she, found a fresh 
means of compelling veracity and obedience on the part of the wicked 
and tyrannical. Many a wild baron or marauding noble cowered when he 
was asked to swear or promise by the relics of St. Cuthbert or St. 
Columbanus, St. Genevieve or St. Martin, and gave back ill-gotten gains 
that a king could not have taken from him.</p>

<p>
<!-- pg 182 --> VIII.</p>

<p>If we would understand well the Middle Ages, we must ever keep in view 
that in those times public life was dominated by two great functional 
ideas -- the sense of <i>personality</i> and the sense of 
<i>responsibility.</i> Throughout those centuries, it was the universal 
persuasion that the final end of society was the perfection of each 
individual soul, or rather, its individual salvation. Not the comforts 
of life, nor an increasing refinement and complexity of earthly 
pleasures, not the scouring of earth and sea to minister to one hour's 
enjoyment, were the ideals of the best men and women of those times. 
Neither did they seek in the organic development of the collective 
unit, the earthly society, their last and sufficient end. To them it 
seemed that human society was organized, not as an end in itself, but 
as a means to enable men to know, love, and serve the Master on this 
earth and be happy with Him in the next. Whatever furthered these views 
of life was good, and all things were bad or indifferent in the measure 
that they fell away from or were useless for this end. This is why the 
great men of the Middle Ages are not its warriors, not its legislators, 
not even its great priests and bishops, but <!-- pg 183 --><i>its 
saints.</i> In a closer personal union with God men found the highest 
uses and meanings of life. It was a temperament essentially spiritual, 
mystic, that forever urged men and women to neglect, even despise, what 
was temporary or earthly, to aspire to a world beyond the low horizon 
of threescore-ten and the grave. Holiness, a god-like purity of mind 
and heart, thorough detachment from the mortal and attachment to the 
immortal and the divine, was the keynote of this thousand years.</p>

<p>During this time it is in saintly men like Patrick, Columbanus, 
Benedict, Boniface, Norbert, Bernard, Thomas of Aquino, Dominic, and 
Francis of Assisi; in saintly women like Bridget, Radegunda, Cunegonda, 
Elizabeth, Catharine of Sienna, that we must look for the fine flower 
of Christian growth. Since the Renaissance, with its reassertion of the 
basic principles of paganism, it has been ever more fashionable to tax 
the Middle Ages with an impossible mysticism, with an unjust contempt 
for the beauty and comfort of the human body, with a false view of 
man's relations to the earth on which he lives and subsists, and the 
society to which he necessarily belongs. It is not my purpose just now 
to defend the mediaeval view, other than to say that <!-- pg 184 --
>they read the gospel simply and candidly, and took this meaning from 
the teachings of Jesus: that they were to seek first the kingdom of God 
and the justice thereof; that they were to imitate the earthly life of 
Jesus Christ; that His precepts and counsels were preferable to all 
suggestions of nature or experience; that He came on earth to reveal a 
new and higher life, in which men should be as free of the flesh and 
its limitations and perversions as God's grace could make them. They 
read in the gospel the praise and example of virginity, the assurance 
that the figure of this world passes away like stubble in a furnace, 
that for every idle word an account should be rendered, that the duties 
of religion and of charity, the devotion of self for others, were 
obligatory on those who would be perfect Christians. They were not 
always skilled logicians, at least not until Aristotle got a chair in 
the Christian schools, and they lived more by the heart than by the 
manual of the statesman or the formulas of the chemist. Therefore, to 
be brief, the Middle Ages are more a period of noble personalities than 
of popularized science, a time of strong, trenchant individualism, when 
each man and each woman leave a mark on the life about them. There are 
those who believe that there <!-- pg 185 -->is more magnetism, more 
genuine inspiration, in such a world and life than in a period of 
golden but general elevation, when all is mediocre by the mere fact 
that no one rises much above the general level. Just so, there are 
those who believe that the rude hard life of the early history of our 
country developed more superior character than the cosmopolitan 
perfection we now enjoy; that the strenuous days of the pioneers 
brought out more virtue than the finished municipal organism of the 
present; that the true use of history consists in the great characters 
it reveals and uplifts; that one view of the solitary white peaks of 
the Rockies is worth a week's journey across the fat plains of the Red 
River or Manitoba.</p>

<p>Just because the view of life popular in the Middle Ages pivoted on 
personality, it was replete to the saturation point with a <i>sense of 
responsibility.</i> How this affected the relations of man with God I 
have just indicated. It was the true source of sanctity, and its 
prevalence is shown by the great multitude of holy men and women who 
meet us on every page of mediaeval history and in every stage of its 
evolution. In man's dealings with society, it affected profoundly his 
concept of public office. According to Christian teaching all power 
comes from God <!-- pg 186 -->and is held for the benefit of one's 
fellow-mortals. It is not a personal inheritance, a thing transmissible 
or to be disposed of by private will. Power over others is vicarious, 
the act of an agent, and as such its use is to be accounted for. The 
Church had not to go far to impress that idea on the clergy. It was 
brought out in letters of gold in the pastoral epistles of St. Paul, 
who only develops the idea set forth in the gospel. It was otherwise 
with the civil power. The lucky soldier who rose to wear the imperial 
purple had no education save that of the camp. The fierce Frank or 
Burgundian noble who had waded through blood to the high seat of 
Merovingian kingship thought only to enjoy the fruit of his courage and 
good fortune. But they met a priest at the foot of the throne who 
warned them that the power was not theirs, but a trust from God; they 
heard a voice from the altar on holydays depicting the true kingship, 
that of David, of Solomon, of Constantine, of Gratian. They met at the 
council-table venerable bishops and abbots who discussed all methods 
from a view-point of divine revelation — notably of Christian history 
and the spirit of Jesus Christ. There was anger enough at this 
perpetual schooling, wild outbursts of passion that they could <!-- pg 
187 -->have no peace with these obstinate priests, fierce excesses of 
cruelty and periods of reaction. But the Catholic clergy succeeded in 
stilling the furnaces of passion that were the barbarian royal hearts, 
and in creating a public opinion in favor of an ideal Christian ruler. 
And when once a great ruler like Charlemagne had risen to incarnate so 
many Christian public virtues of a master of men, his memory was held 
in benediction by all, and his shadow fell across all the centuries to 
come, blotting out the irregular and bloody past, and forecasting the 
great royal saints of a later day -- a Henry of Germany, an Elizabeth 
of Thuringia, an Edward of England, a Stephen of Hungary, a Louis of 
France, a Wenceslaus of Bohemia. In time, this practical education of 
mediaeval rulers became academic, and we have a long catalogue of 
"instructions" for kings, "warnings" for kings, beginning with the 
golden booklet of the deacon Agapetus to his master the great Emperor 
Justinian, and coming down over seven hundred years to the fine 
treatise attributed to St. Thomas Aquinas, "On the Government of 
Princes." You will see little reference to such. in the ordinary 
histories of pedagogy. Yet they have had profound influence in forming 
royal youth at a time when <!-- pg 188 -->the happiness of peoples 
depended much on the personality of their rulers. Public office was 
therefore a quasi-priestly thing in the Middle Ages, a trust, a 
deposit, and the proper administration of it a knightly thing, 
something to affect the conscience almost like the honor of the soldier 
or the good name of woman.</p>

<p>No doubt there was plenty of human weakness, plenty of hideous 
contradiction of those ideals. But the ideals themselves were held up 
and even realized. Thereby no European people could fall into utter 
servitude morally and mentally like the subjects of imperial Rome or 
the millions of bureaucratic China. In the resplendent gospel of Jesus 
Christ, in the self-identical and constant teachings of His Church, in 
the great and shining examples of His saints, there was a source of 
self-judgment and self-uplifting that could never be quite dried up, 
and which, from time to time, the Angel of Reform came down and touched 
with salutary effect.</p>

<p>
IX.</p>

<p>There is a story told of Ataulf, the general of the Goths and the 
successor of Alaric, the conqueror of Rome, at the beginning of this 
period, that he had long meditated the extinction of the <!-- pg 189 --
>whole Roman power, and the substitution of Gothic life and habits 
throughout Europe. He was held back from this act by the reflection 
that without the laws of Rome he could not think of governing the 
world. Barbarian as he was, he had seized the first principle of good 
government, the creation of laws at once stable and equitable, tried by 
experience and adapted to the circumstances of the age and 
civilization. In the course of a thousand years Rome had built up such 
a system — the Roman law. Tradition, experience, equity, philosophy, 
religion, had contributed each its share, and the eminently practical 
and sober genius of the Roman people had welded the whole into a fabric 
that yet stands, the admiration of all thinking men.</p>

<p>When the Middle Ages opened, with the military cunning and strength of 
Rome departed and a dozen barbarian nations camped triumphantly over 
the Europe that Rome had subdued and civilized, this law of Rome, the 
basis of her great Peace and Order, the "Pax Romana" that she had 
established, was in the greatest danger of perishing. Indeed, it would 
have perished, save for the Catholic Church. By saving the law of Rome 
as her own law, she saved to all future society the idea and example, 
the spirit <!-- pg 190 -->and the principles, of social authority in 
the State, such as it had been evolved at Rome in the long conflict of 
peoples and races that kept steadily widening from the Tiber to the 
extremities of the habitable world. The homely republican virtues of 
Old Rome, the humane and discriminating soul of Greek philosophy, the 
vast ambitions of the Orient, the tradition of a golden age of equality 
and simplicity, the profound knowledge of the average human mind and 
its norms of action, a religious respect for distributive justice, a 
great sense of the utility and loveliness of peace and harmony -- all 
these are so many visible traits or elements of the Roman law that 
render it applicable in all times to all mankind -- what St. Augustine 
used to call "human reason itself set down in writing."</p>

<p>This law the Catholic Church through Europe elected to live by herself, 
at a time when every barbarian had the rude law of his own forest or 
mountains. Wherever a Catholic bishop governed, or a priest went as a 
missionary, he bore with him the fulness of the law of Rome. It clung 
to his person when the civil centres were laid desolate, Rome, Milan, 
London and York, Saragossa, Paris, Trier, Cologne. The law of <!-- pg 
191 -->contracts, the law of last wills and testaments, the laws that 
govern the life of the citizen in the walled town and the peasant in 
the open field, the general principles and the practical case-law that 
Rome had been creating from the Rhine to the Euphrates and from the 
Grampians to Mount Atlas, were now in the custody of the same hands 
that bore aloft the gospel through the forests of Germany, or uplifted 
the Christian sacrifice over the smoking ruins of the proudest cities 
of ancient Europe.</p>

<p>It is owing to the Catholic Church that we now enjoy a regular 
procedure in the administration of law. Our legal procedure is 
substantially that of the Roman law. The barbarian peoples long 
detested the regular slow order of Roman justice. They despised the 
written proof, the summoning of witnesses, the delays, exceptions, and 
appeals that secure the innocent or helpless from oppression, and 
compel even the most reluctant to acknowledge the justice of 
condemnation. In all these centuries the Church applied this procedure 
to her own clerics in every land, and embodied it in the Canon Law that 
was the same the world over, as Roman law had been the same the world 
over. The justice of the barbarian was summary, violent, and productive 
of endless <!-- pg 192 -->vendettas. The terrible German Faustrecht, 
the Vehmgerichte of the Middle Ages, like the work of our lynching 
committees, were a last relic of what was once universal. After the 
fall of the Roman power, there was no one but the Catholic Church to 
represent the social authority as such over against the wild and savage 
feelings of a multitude of barbarians, intoxicated with the glory of 
conquest and the riches of the degenerate but luxurious world of Gaul 
and Italy. When Clovis, the founder of the French monarchy, was 
distributing the booty after a great battle, he set aside for himself a 
tall and precious vase. Thereupon a great Frank stepped out of the 
ranks, and with his spear shattered the vase in pieces. "O King, thou 
shalt have thy share," he cried, "and no more!" Clovis swallowed his 
wrath. The next year while reviewing his army, he passed before his 
bold contradictor, and noticing some negligence about his dress, bade 
him correct it. As the latter stooped to tie the string of his shoe, 
the king lifted his own huge spear and drove it through the neck of the 
soldier. Thus a victorious king administered justice, and it is typical 
of what went on for centuries through Europe.</p>

<p>It was the bishops of the Church who induced <!-- pg 193 -->the 
barbarians to temper their own laws and customs with the law of Rome. 
And whatever laws we study -- those of France, or Germany, or Spain, or 
England, or Ireland -- we shall find that when we come to the line 
where they emerge from barbarism or paganism, the transition is 
effected by Catholic bishops and priests. Throughout the Middle Ages 
all law was looked on as coming from God, as holy, and therefore in a 
way subject to the approval and custody of the Church. It was the crown 
of the moral order, the basis of right conduct, and hence the royal 
chanceries of Europe were always governed by an ecclesiastic, whose 
duty it was to enlighten the king's conscience, and to see that neither 
the gospel nor the spirit of it were infringed.</p>

<p>The hasty, vindictive quality of barbarian justice was long tempered by 
the Right of Asylum, which the churches and great monasteries afforded. 
The greatest criminals could find shelter there, as in the Cities of 
Refuge of Israel, if not against punishment, at least against 
punishment without trial or defence.</p>

<p>On the judge's bench one could often see the Catholic bishop, sometimes 
administering the law of the State by order of the king, sometimes the 
counsellor of a soldier or noble ignorant of <!-- pg 194 -->law and 
procedure, sometimes the defender of a town or city overburdened with 
taxes or tributes, sometimes the lawyer of the oppressed and the 
innocent. He is the real man of law, the real representative of order 
and justice, and for many long centuries the whole fabric of society 
depended on the succession of good and devoted men in the hierarchy of 
the Church throughout Europe. They kept alive the sanctity of oaths, 
without which there is no sure justice. The latter is based on the fear 
of God, and only the Catholic Church could emphasize that idea in those 
ages of bloodshed and violence. It was well that such men feared 
something -- the anger of God, the wrath of the saints over whose 
relics they swore, the pains of hell --otherwise there would have been 
no bounds to the arbitrary excesses of a feudal aristocracy that 
despised all beneath it, and was ready to cut down with the sword any 
attempt to dominate it. Let any one read the private lives of some 
Merovingian. and Caroling kings, or the annals that tell the story of 
Italy in the tenth century and again in the fourteenth, and he will see 
to what depths of impious blasphemy the mediaeval man could sink when 
he once lost his fear of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p><!-- pg 195 -->It was the Catholic clergy who taught these barbarians 
how to administer society, who wrote out the formulas of government, 
the charters, the diplomas, the numerous documents needed to carry on 
the smallest community where there is any respect for property, office, 
personal rights and duties. From the registry of fields and houses to 
the correspondence between king and king, between emperor and pope, all 
the writing of the Middle Ages was long in the hands of the clergy. 
Thereby they saved to the commonwealths of Europe in their infancy no 
little remnant of old Roman habits of government, traditions of 
economy, order, equity, that they had taken over from the hands of the 
laymen of Rome during the fifth century, when the empire was breaking 
up every year, like a ship upon cruel rocks in a night of storm and 
despair.</p>

<p>In these centuries the frequent synods and councils of the bishops and 
priests were to the world of Europe what our Parliament and Congress 
are to-day. The brain and the heart of Europe was then the Catholic 
clergy. In their frequent meetings the barbarian could see how to 
conduct a public assembly, the distinction of rank and office, the uses 
of written records and <!-- pg 196 -->documents, the individual self-
assertion, and the vote by majorities, the appeals to experience, to 
history, to past meetings, to the law of God in the Old and New 
Testament. He could see the stern and even justice dealt out by the 
ecclesiastics to their own delinquent members -- deposition, 
degradation, exile. He could see how these churchmen, when gathered 
together, feared no earthly power, and asserted the rights of the poor 
and the lowly against every oppression, however high placed. He could 
see how they feared no condition of men, and reproved popular vices as 
well as royal lust and avarice. He could see how every order and estate 
in the Church had its right to representation in these synods and 
councils. The day will come in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries 
when civil parliaments will arise -- the first germs of the great 
legislative bodies of our day -- but their cradle will always remain 
the mediaeval meeting in which churchmen, and often the laymen with 
them, laid the first beams of constitutional government.</p>

<p>X.</p>

<p>When we say that the Catholic Church was the principal almost the only 
<i>educator of the <!-- pg 197 -->Middle Ages,</i> we assert a fact 
that to all historians is as evident as sunlight. To begin with, all 
the schools were hers. Such schools as were saved here and there in 
Southern France and Northern Italy out of the wreck of the Roman State 
and Empire were saved by her. Her bishops, indeed, from the fifth to 
the eighth century were more bent on the defence of the weak and the 
poor than on aught else, on the conquest of the barbarian character, 
the quenching of its fires of avarice, luxury, lawlessness. 
Nevertheless, many were patrons of learning, like St. Avitus of Vienne, 
from whose writings Milton did not disdain to borrow more than one 
beauty of his "Paradise Lost"; St. Caesarius of Aries, a patron of 
learning whose relative, St. Caesaria, was one of the first to impose 
on the nuns of her community the copying and illumination of 
manuscripts; St. Nicetius of Trier, St. Gregory of Tours, and many 
other similar men. But, generally, all such men considered that they 
were in a conflagration, in a storm; the principal education was that 
of their wild and ferocious masters. Let any one read the pages of 
Gregory of Tours in his Ecclesiastical History of the Franks, or the 
charming volume of Augustine Thierry on the Merovingian kings and their 
<!-- pg 198 -->courts, and he will understand what a great and hard 
task lay before these Gallo-Roman bishops, who stood for law and order 
and civilization, as well as religion, against victorious barbarians 
whose veneer of refinement only hid the hottest fires of human passion.</p>

<p>The schools which every Catholic bishop from the beginning necessarily 
conducted, in order to keep up an enlightened clergy, were never 
abandoned. The archdeacon, in this savage time, looked after them. They 
are numerous in Gaul, in Italy, in Spain. The classics are studied in 
them, the history of the Christian Church, the laws of the Church and 
the State. Schoolmasters arose, like Boethius, Cassiodorus, and later 
the saintly Bede, Isidore of Seville, and Alcuin, not to speak of the 
multitude of Irish masters. The manuals and teaching of these men 
lasted in many places fully one thousand years. It was not the highest 
standard of learning, but it was all that could be hoped for, and much 
more than the great majority wanted in a period of blood and iron, when 
society was a-forming again, and men could seriously ask themselves 
whether one hour of bestial enjoyment was not worth a century of study. 
Side by side with the numerous episcopal schools went the little <!-- 
pg 199 -->schools of the new monasteries, where the novices of the 
Benedictines, the children of their peasants, those of the nobles who 
had any idealism, could and did learn the principles and elements of 
reading, writing, arithmetic, eloquence, music, geometry, and 
geography. The art of handwriting was kept up, and the skill of the 
ancients in decorating manuscripts was saved. Out of it, as out of a 
chrysalis, shall one day come a Raphael and a Michael Angelo. The 
bishops profited by the good dispositions of Charlemagne and other 
upright kings, like Alfred of England, to inculcate a love of learning 
and to keep alive their schools and the supply of masters -- no easy 
thing in the darkest days of the Middle Ages, when culture was timid 
and stay-at-home. Much refinement was kept alive within the peaceful 
precincts of the nunneries all over Europe. The noble pages of Count 
Montalembert on the Anglo-Saxon nuns ought to be read by all. The art 
of embroidery, of lace-working, of delicate handiwork in cloth and 
leather, the skill in illuminating and the covering of books, the 
domestic art of cooking, the arts that flourish in the immediate shadow 
of the altar, and those nameless graces of adornment that woman bears 
everywhere with her as <!-- pg 200 -->an atmosphere -- all flourished 
in these homes of virtue, calm and reserved amid the din of war, 
themselves an element of education in Christian eyes, since they upheld 
the great basic principles of our religion -- self-restraint and self-
denial.</p>

<p>We shall leave to the Arabs of Spain the merit and the credit honestly 
due them for their refinement and their civilization at a time when 
Christendom was surely inferior in many ways. But the Christendom of 
the ninth and tenth centuries was necessarily armed to the teeth 
against these very Spanish Arabs, in whose blood the new tinge of Greek 
culture, caught from learned Jews and Oriental Christianity, was too 
weak surely to withstand the hot current of the desert that surged 
successfully within them. Christianity has what no other religion has -
- a divine power of reform, which is nothing else than an uplifting of 
the common heart to its Divine Founder, a cry of Peccavi, and an honest 
resolution to live again by His spirit and His principles. It cannot, 
therefore, sink beneath a certain level, cannot become utterly sensual, 
utterly barbarous and pagan.</p>

<p>The Middle Ages had two schools, wherein the individual heart could 
always, at any and <!-- pg 201 -->every moment, rise to the highest 
level -- the worship of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament, and the loving 
veneration of His Blessed Mother. The former was a perpetual spring of 
noble conceptions of life, a spur of godliness, an incentive to 
repentance, a live coal on every altar, whose perfume penetrated all 
who am proached, and attracted and consumed with the holiest of loves 
the very susceptible hearts of mediaeval men and women not yet "blas‚s" 
with the deceptions of materialism, yet living in and by faith, yet 
believing in God, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell. All the architecture and 
fine arts of the Middle Ages are there. They are thank-offerings, 
creations of love, and as such, stamped with an individual something, a 
personal note that disappears when faith grows cold. In the "Lauda Sion 
Salvatorem," of St. Thomas, we hear the most majestic expression of the 
influence of Jesus in the Blessed Sacrament on the daily spiritual life 
of mediaeval Europe, just as the Duomo of Orvieto reflects His action 
upon the hearts of the artists of Italy, and the feast of Corpus 
Christi enshrines forever His plastic transforming power in the 
widening and deepening of the Christian liturgy.</p>

<p>As to the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Middle <!-- pg 202 -->Ages were 
solicited on all sides by the mystery and the beauty of this type. Only 
once did it enter the mind of man to imagine in one and the same woman 
the serenity of the noblest matron, the pathos of the most loving 
motherhood, and the white splendor of stainless maidenhood! Only once 
did the heavens bend so close to the earth, and leave a human heart 
glorified as a pledge of their love, as an earnest of their value and 
their reality, as a souvenir of long-forgotten days of primal innocence 
and joy! With an unerring Greek sense of order and beauty, the earliest 
Christian artists seized on this new, transforming, moulding idea. They 
saw in it something sacramental, something that was at once a symbol 
and a force. Jesus had proclaimed that God was love, and His religion 
therefore a service of love. In the Maiden Mary that idea of love was 
tangible, immediate, eloquent, in our poor human way.</p>

<p>True, there was the supreme beauty of the Godhead, of Jesus Christ! But 
that was an original, flawless, essential beauty. It shone all too 
remotely, too sternly and solemnly; the earthly element was there, 
indeed, but suffering, shot through with hideous streaks of sorrow and 
debasement.</p>

<p><!-- pg 203 -->But here in this type of the Mother and Child that 
divine love which is the root and the crown of Christianity, its sap 
and support, is brought within human reach. We can handle its strong 
fires, as it were, without being scorched or wasted by them.<A 
HREF="note">*</a> Between the puissant Maker, <!-- pg 204 -->the 
omniscient Judge, and our littleness there is interposed a thoroughly 
human figure of sympathy, pity, and tenderness all made up, herself the 
most lovely creation of the divine hands, and yet the most human of our 
kind.</p> 

<p>XI.</p>

<p>I make only passing reference to the great universities of the Middle 
Ages. Every one knows that from Paris to Glasgow, from Bologna to 
Aberdeen, they are papal creations, living and thriving on the 
universal character and privileges they drew from the papal 
recognition. Only a universal world-power like the papacy could create 
schools of universal knowledge, and lend to their degrees a universal 
value. I hasten to bring out some less familiar views of the influences 
of Catholicism as an educational force. There are many kinds of 
education, and not all of it is gotten from books or under the shadow 
of the pedagogue's severe visage.</p>

<p><!-- pg 205 -->It is true that the education given by the Catholic 
Church was very largely for ecclesiastics. Still, there was a great 
deal more of lay education than is usually admitted, especially in 
France and Italy. From the renaissance of the Roman law in the twelfth 
century, laymen had the most distinguished careers open to them, and as 
time went on they practically monopolized the great wealth that always 
follows the complication and intricacies of the law. However, the 
churchmen used their education, on the whole, for the popular good. 
<i>Every cathedral in Europe was a seat of good government.</i> There 
traditions of justice and equity were administered with an eye to the 
new needs of the times. There was learning with charity, affection for 
the multitudes with inherited practice of self-sacrifice. Often the 
only power to resist the excesses of feudalism and to insist on the 
common rights of man was the bishop. In his immortal tale of the 
"Promessi Sposi," Alessandro Manzoni has drawn with a master-hand the 
portrait of a great bishop in conflict with a feudal master. That this 
bishop was really Fed erigo Borromeo, a near relative of St. Charles 
Borromeo, does not detract from the truth or interest of the portrayal. 
Every monastery was <!-- pg 206 -->a home of the peaceful arts, 
domestic and agricultural. The great educational virtues of order, 
economy, regularity, division of labor, foresight, and the like, were 
taught in each together with other useful virtues, like patience, 
humility, submission -- those elements of the poor man's philosophy 
that are as useful to-day when a Tolstoi preaches them, as they were 
when Christ gave the example that alone makes them practicable, and as 
they will be when the hot fevers of our changing conditions have burned 
out, and we settle down again to one of those long cycles of social 
immobility that have their function in the vast round of human life, as 
sleep has in the daily life of the individual. By its very nature, the 
details of the popular education of the Middle Ages escape us. There 
are no written annals for the poor and the lowly. Yet all over Europe 
there went on daily a profitable education of the masses as to their 
true origin and end, the nature value and uses of life, the nature and 
sanctity of duty, calling, estate. Every church was a forum of 
Christian politics, where the people were formed easily and regularly 
by thousands of devoted parish priests, whose names are written in the 
Book of Life, who walked this earth blamelessly, and who were <!-- pg 
207 -->the true schoolmasters of European mankind in the days of its 
infancy and first helpless youth. Let any one read "Ekkehard," the 
noble historical romance of Victor Scheffel, and the still nobler poem 
of Weber, "Dreizehnlinden," and he will see, done by two hands of 
genius, the process that is otherwise written in all the chronicles and 
laws of Europe; in all its institutions, and the great facts of its 
history as far as they affect the interests of the people. The 
countless churches, chapels, oratories, were like so many open museums 
and galleries, where the eye gained a sense of color and outline, the 
mind a wider range of historical information, and the heart many a 
consolation. They were the books of the people, fitted to their 
aptitudes, located where they were needed, forever open to the reaper 
in the field, the tired traveller on his way, the women and children of 
the village or hamlet. They were so many silent pulpits, out of which 
the loving Jesus looked down and taught men from His cross, from His, 
tabernacle, the true education of equality, fraternity, patience -- all 
healing virtues of His great heart.</p>

<p>From Otranto tp Drontheim, from the Hebrides and Greenland to the Black 
Sea, there went on this effective preaching, this largest possible 
edu<!-- pg 208 -->cation for real life. In it whole peoples were the 
pupils, and the Catholic Church was the mistress. When it was done, out 
of semi-savages she had made polite and industrious nations; out of 
ignorant and brutal warriors she had made Christian knights and 
soldiers; out of enemies of the fine arts and their rude destroyers she 
had made a new world of most cunning artificers and craftsmen; out of 
the scum and slime of humanity that the Roman beat down with his sword 
and the Greek drew back from with horror, she had made gentlemen like 
Bayard and ladies like Blanche of France and Isabel of Castile.</p>

<p>In the history of mankind this was never seen before, and will, 
perhaps, never be seen again. How was the wonder accomplished that the 
Slav, dreamy and mystical, should feel and act like the fierce and 
violent Teuton; that the highly individual and romantic Keltic soul 
should suffer the yoke of Roman order and discipline? How came it about 
that all over Europe there was a common understanding as to the 
principles of life, of mutual human relations, of the dealings of one 
society with another? How could it be that the word of an aged man at 
Rome should be borne with the <!-- pg 209 -->swiftness of the wind to 
every little church, to every castled crag, to every forgotten hamlet 
and remote valley of the Alps or the Pyrenees, and be listened to with 
reverence and submission? How was this absolute conquest, for conquest 
it was, of the human heart accomplished? Very largely by the Liturgy of 
the Catholic Church. It was a conquest of prayer, the public prayer of 
the Catholic Church. This organized worship of God lies at the basis of 
all European civilization, and it is the just boast of Catholicism, 
that such as it is, it is her work. When we take up a Roman Missal, we 
take up the book that more than any other transformed the world of 
barbarism. In it lie the ordinary public worship of the Catholic 
Church, the service of the Mass, the gospels broken up into short 
paragraphs, the marrow of the life-wisdom of the Old Testament, the 
deposit of world-experience that her great bishops and priests had 
gained, profound but true comments of the Church herself, hymns of 
astonishing beauty, tenderness, and rapture, prayers that are like 
ladders of light from the heart of man to the feet of his Maker. It is 
this public prayer that ensouled every church, from the wooden chapels 
<!-- pg 210 -->of Ireland or Norway to the high embossed roof of 
Westminster or Cologne. This prayer first inflamed the heart of the 
priest, and put into his mouth a tongue of irresistible conviction, 
and, therefore, of unction and eloquence. After all, it was nothing but 
the Scripture of the Old and the New Testament; but it was the 
Scripture announced, spoken, sung, preached; the Scripture appealing to 
the public heart with every art that man was capable of using to make 
it triumph. There was never a more profound historical error than to 
imagine that the Middle Ages were ignorant of the Scriptures. Let any 
one who yet labors under the delusion read the epoch-making book of two 
learned writers, Schwarz and Laib, on the Poor Man's Bible in the 
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>So there grew up the concept of solidarity, of a Christian people bound 
together by ties holier and deeper than race, or tongue, or 
nationality, or human culture could create -- a sense of mutual 
responsibility, a public conscience, and a public will. <i>What is 
known as public opinion</i> is in reality a mediaeval product; for then 
first the world saw all mankind, of Europe at least, possessed of 
common views and conscious of their moral value and necessity.</p>

<p>In so far as public opinion is an educational <!-- pg 211 -->force, it 
is the result of those frequent appeals that the clergy of the Middle 
Ages made to a higher law and a higher order of ideas than human 
ingenuity or force could command -- it is the result of a thousand 
conflicts like those about royal marriages and divorces that at once 
rise to a supernatural level, of as many dead-locks like that between 
Henry IV. of Germany and Gregory VII., where the independence, the very 
existence, of the spiritual power was at stake. The only weapons of the 
Church were moral ones, popular faith in her office and her rights, 
universal popular respect for her tangible and visible services, 
popular affection for her as the mystical Bride of Christ, a popular 
conviction that she alone stood between armed rapacity and the 
incipient liberties of the people.</p>

<p>
XII.</p>

<p>There is a very subtle and remarkable educational influence of the 
Catholic Church that is not often appreciated at its full value -- I 
mean her share in the preservation and formation of the <i>great modern 
vernaculars,</i> such as English, German, Irish, the Slavonic tongues. 
Even languages like French, Italian, and Spanish, <!-- pg 212 -->the 
Romance tongues, formed from the everyday or rustic Latin of the 
soldiers and the traders of Rome, her peasants and slaves, owe a great 
deal to the affection and solicitude of the Church. In all these 
tongues there was always a certain amount of instruction provided for 
the people. The missionaries had to learn them, to explain the great 
truths in them, and to deal day by day with the fierce German, the 
turbulent Slav, the high-spirited Kelt. It has always been the policy 
of the Catholic Church to respect the natural and traditional in every 
people so far as they have not gotten utterly corrupted. From Caedmon 
down, the earliest monuments of Anglo-Saxon literature are nearly all 
ecclesiastical, and all of it has been saved by ecclesiastics. The 
earliest extensive written monument of the German tongues is the famous 
Heliand or paraphrase of the gospel, all imbued with the high warlike 
spirit of the ancient Teutons. All that we have of the old Gothic 
tongue, the basis of German philology, has come down to us through the 
translation of the Bible by the good Bishop Ulfilas out of the Vulgate 
into Gothic, or from the solicitude of St. Columbanus and his Irish 
companions to convert the Arian Goths of Lombardy. These languages <!-- 
pg 213 -->were once rude and coarse; they got a high content, the 
thought of Greece and Rome, through the Catholic churchman. They took 
on higher and newer grammatical forms in the same way. Spiritual ideas 
entered them, and a whole world of images and linguistic helps came 
from a knowledge of the Scriptures that were daily expounded in them. 
Through the Old Testament the history of the world entered these 
tongues as explained by Catholic priests. Their pagan coarseness and 
vulgarity were toned down or utterly destroyed. St. Patrick and his 
bishops and poets, we are told, examined the Brehon Law of the Irish 
and blessed it, except what was against the gospel or the natural law. 
Then he bade the poet Dubtach put a thread of verse about it, that is, 
cast it into metrical form. The first Irish missionaries in Germany, 
like St. Gall and St. Kilian, spoke to the people both in Latin and in 
German, and it is believed that the first German dictionary was their 
wqrk, for the needs of preaching and intercourse. Some shadow of the 
majesty of Rome thus fell upon the modern tongues from the beginning, 
sbme infusion of the subtleness and delicacy of the Greek mind fell to 
their lot. The mental toil and victory <!-- pg 214 -->and glory of a 
thousand years were thus saved, at least in part. The Catholic Church 
was the bridge over which these great and desirable goods came down in 
a long night of confusion and disorder. The great epics of France and 
Germany, the Chansons de Geste, were saved in the monasteries or with 
the connivance of monks, to whom the wandering singers were very dear 
in spite of their satire and free tongues. The "Chanson de Roland," the 
"Lied of the Nibelungs," the "Lied of Gudrun," the great Sagas and Edda 
of the Northland, owe their preservation and no little of their 
content, color, and form, to the interest of monks and churchmen in the 
saving of old stories, old fables, and old genealogies, especially 
after the first period of national conversion had gone by. We have yet 
in Irish a lovely tale, the "Colloquy of Ossian with St. Patrick," in 
which the average sympathy of the Old Irish cleric for the relics of 
the past and his just sense of their spirit and meaning are brought out 
very vividly and picturesquely.</p>

<p>It is in the Romance languages that the noble institution of chivalry 
that L‚on Gautier has so perfectly described found its best expression; 
that the roots of all modern poetry <!-- pg 215 -->that will live are 
now known to lie; that the introspective and meditative phases of the 
literary spirit first showed themselves on a large scale; that the 
intensely personal note of Christianity comes out quite free and 
natural, unattended by that distracting perfection of form that the 
classic Latin and Greek could not help offering; that purely personal 
virtues like courage, honor, loyalty in man, fidelity, tenderness, 
gentleness, moral beauty in woman, are brought out as the highest 
natural goods of life, in contradiction to the Greek and Roman who 
looked on the great political virtues and the commonwealth, the State 
itself, as the only fit ideals of humanity. Thereby, to say the least, 
they excluded the weaker sex from its due share in all life and from 
public recognition of those excellencies by which alone it could hope 
to shine and excel. One day the labor of ages blossomed in a perfect 
and centennial flower, the "Divina Commedia" of Dante, that has ten 
thousand roots in the daily life, the common doctrine and discipline of 
the Catholic Church, and remains forever an unapproachable document of 
the medheval genius, indeed, but also the immortal proof of how 
thoroughly the Catholic Church had educated the popular mind and heart 
in all that was good, true, and worthy of imitation, in antiquity as 
well as in the history that then as now men were making from day to 
day. He was conscious himself that heaven and earth had built up the 
poem in his great heart. Perhaps he was also conscious that God was 
making of him another Homer, another Vergil, out of whose glorious 
lines all future ages should, even despite themselves, drink a divine 
ichor -- the spirit of Jesus Christ as exemplified in Catholicism.</p>

<p>
XIII.</p>

<p>Under the aegis of this extraordinary power of the Church, there grew 
up a <i>common mental culture,</i>based on religion and penetrated with 
its spirit. There was one language of scholarship and refinement -- the 
Latin -- that often rose to a height not unworthy of its original 
splendor. Something common and universal marked all the arts, and the 
workman of Italy or Germany might exercise his craft with ease and 
profit in England or Spain. Within the Catholic fold the freedom of 
association was unlimited, not only for religious purposes, but for all 
economic and artistic ones as well. Human energy es<!-- pg 217 -->sayed 
every channel of endeavor, and in some, notably in architecture, has 
never soared so high in the centuries that followed.</p>

<p>One result of this solidarity of thought and purpose was the creation 
of what we call the <i>Western mind and spirit,</i> a complex ideal 
view of life that differs from the past views of Greek and Roman, as it 
is in many respects opposed to the life-philosophy of the Eastern 
world. Human liberty and equality, hopefulness in progress, a spirit of 
advance, of self-reliance --an optimism, in other words -- are among 
its connoting marks. All this is older and deeper than anything of the 
last three or four centuries. It was in the Catholic Italian Columbus, 
venturing out upon the unknown ocean, and his Portuguese predecessors, 
in the Conquistadori, in the endless attempts to penetrate China and 
the East from Marco Polo and the Franciscan missionaries down, in the 
Crusaders, in the long and successful resistance of Hungary, Poland, 
and Austria to the advance of Islam. Here, indeed, the Western world 
owes a debt of gratitude to those who arrested the teachings and the 
spirit of the camel-driver of Mecca. No one saw better than the bishops 
of Rome that the world might not stand still; that the eternal 
antithesis <!-- pg 218 -->of the East and West was on again; that the 
fierce impact of Islam breaking against the walls of Constantinople was 
nothing in comparison with its boglike encroachments at every point of 
contact with Europe. It is a pathetic tale -- their tears, implorings, 
and objurgations. Something they accomplished. But if the Oriental 
problem is still quivering with life; if Western civilization, that is 
in all essentials Catholic civilization, has to go again at the mighty 
task -- but this time from the setting sun instead of from Jerusalem 
and St. Jean d'Acre -- it is because one day, shortly after the fall of 
Constantinople in 1452, the powers of Europe left the Bishop of Rome at 
Ancona call on them in vain to go out with the little pontifical fleet 
and retake from the unspeakable Turk the city of Constantinople. Pius 
II., not the kings of Europe, was the real statesman, as every 
succeeding decade shows. However, the popes estopped the fatalism and 
dry rot of Islam from the possession of the Danube; they loaned 
indirectly to the Grand Dukes of Muscovy the strength out of which they 
one day. carved the office of Czar; their influence was felt in all the 
Balkan peninsula; their city was the one spot where an intelligent and 
disinterested observation of events by the <!-- pg 219 -->Golden Horn 
went on. Better, after all, a thousand times, a Europe torn by domestic 
religious dissension, than a Europe, perhaps an America, caught in the 
deadly anaconda-folds of Islam, that never yet failed to smother all 
mental and civil progress, and has thereby declared itself the most 
immoral of all religious forces known to history!</p>

<p>
XIV.</p>

<p>Other phases there are of Catholicism as a plastic formative power in 
the life of the peoples of Europe, as the creator of their distinctive 
institutions; they may come up for brief notice at another time. Thus, 
the institution of chivalry, with its mystic idealization of woman; the 
ever-increasing authority and influence of woman herself; the honor of 
saintly character, essentially, like woman, unwarlike; the function of 
the pilgrim, the monk, the papal envoy, as disseminators of general 
views and principles; the publication of great papal documents, with 
their lengthy arguments; the multitude of friars drawing their office 
and authority from a central source and upholding. its prestige at 
every village cross; the history of the Church as related from ten 
thousand pulpits; the genuine <!-- pg 220 -->influence of the great 
festivals, general and local; the public penances; the frequent 
striking renunciation of high office and worldly comforts; the frequent 
reformation of manners; the increasing use of objects of piety, of the 
fine arts, as a spur or a lever for devotion -- all these and other 
agencies were everywhere and at once at work, and helped to give the 
mediaeval life that intense charm of motion, color, and variety that 
every student of history must always find in it.</p>

<A NAME="note"></a>
<p>* "Rugged and unlovely, indeed, was all that the outward aspect of 
religion at first presented to the world; it was the contrast presented 
by the dim and dreary Catacombs underground to the pure and brilliant 
Italian sky and the monuments of Roman wealth and magnificence above. 
But in that poor and mean society, which cared so little for the things 
of sense and sight, there were nourished and growing up -- for, indeed, 
it was the Church of the God of all glory and all beauty, the chosen 
home of the Eternal creating Spirit -- thoughts of a perfect beauty 
above this world; of a light and a glory which the sun could never see; 
of types, in character and in form, of grace, of sweetness, of 
nobleness, of tenderness, of perfection, which could find no home in 
time -- which were the eternal and the unseen on which human life 
bordered, and which was to it, indeed, 'no foreign land.' There these 
Romans unlearned their old hardness and gained a new language and new 
faculties. Hardly and with difficulty, and with scanty success, did 
they at first strive to express what glowed with such magnificence to 
their inward eye, and kindled their souls within them. Their efforts 
were rude -- rude in art, often hardly less rude in language. But that 
divine and manifold idea before them, they knew that it was a reality; 
it should not escape them, though it still baffled them -- they would 
not let it go. And so, step by step, age after age, as it continued to 
haunt their minds, it gradually grew into greater distinctness and 
expression. From thb rough attempts in the catacombs or the later 
mosaics, in all their roughness so instinct with the majesty and 
tenderness and severe sweetness of the thoughts which inspired them -- 
from the emblems and types and figures, the trees and rivers of 
Paradise, the dove of peace, the palms of triumph, the Good Shepherd, 
the heart no longer 'desiring,' but at last <i>tasting</i> 'the 
waterbrooks,' from the faint and hesitating adumbrations of the most 
awful of human countenances -- from all these feeble but earnest 
attempts to body forth what the soul was full of, Christian art passed, 
with persistent undismayed advance, through the struggles of the Middle 
Ages to the inexpressible delicacy and beauty of Giotto and Fra 
Angelico, to the Last supper of Leonardo, to the highest that the human 
mind ever imagined of tenderness and unearthly majesty, in the Mother 
and the Divine Son of the Madonna di San Sisto." -- Dean Church in 
"Gifts of Civilization" (1892), pp. 208-9.</p>
