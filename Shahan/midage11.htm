<h1>The Cathedral-Builders of Mediaeval Europe</h1>

<p>IF we observe ourselves and the multitudinous life about us, we shall 
all agree that most of what is typical, characterktic of our own 
generation, perishes with us. Man is largely a thing of the present. 
Most of his time is spent in fighting off decay and death, that, 
nevertheless, press on him with the slow and certain speed of the 
Alpine glacier. Of the popular daily life of the middle of the last 
century, only reminiscences remain; and when those are gone whose 
hearts and minds still retain vivid impressions of the past, the tide 
of oblivion makes swifter haste, and soon obliterates all but the most 
striking landmarks, those great events and institutions that are the 
common property of a race or a nation. Even literature, though it is 
usually said to hold the most sacred experiences of every people, is 
only a fragment of fragments, retains but a tithe of the passions, the 
hopes, the struggles, the triumphs, and glories, that made up the sum 
of life as it was actually lived <!-- pg 312 -->by men and women. As far as the 
past is concerned, we walk amid shadows and reflections, in an ever 
deepening twilight.</p>

<p>This thought is of some importance when we look back over the thousand 
years of the Middle Ages for some great convincing illustration of the 
spirit and scope of Catholicism, something that shall be as strictly 
its own work as the Homeric chants or the marbles of the Parthenon are 
the work of the Greek soul, the great roads of Europe and the Code of 
Justinian the product of the genius of Rome. Catholic Christianity in 
that thousand years of the Middle Ages dominated fully and freely the 
life of European mankind. What legacy has it left the human race, at 
once monumental and unique, useful and holy, worthy of its own claims, 
and comparable with those remains by which we judge other religions 
that lay, or once did lay, claim to universal acceptance? Say what we 
will, make what appeal we will to the social benefits of a religion, 
its written documents of a literary character or value, its political 
uses, its successful moulding over of the common heart, its answers to 
the eternal questions of the soul, the common conscience, its 
upbuilding of the spiritual man, individually and collectively -- 
develop <!-- pg 313 -->all these admirable arguments as we will, there remains 
the deep and just query: What <i>monuments</i> has it left behind?</p>

<p>The hand of man is very cunning, and tends very naturally to fashion in 
some public and permanent manner the ideals that the brain has 
conceived and the heart cherished. The most refined Greek ethnicism had 
its Acropolis at Athens, its Temple of Diana at Ephesus. Roman 
ethnicism had ills Temple of Fortune at Praeneste, its Coliseum at 
Rome. Those philosophies of life that are as religions to the followers 
of Confucius and Buddha have each flowered in a peculiar art that may 
seem fantastic to us, but has yet an intimate relationship with the 
doctrines that it glorifies and perpetuates. General doctrines, that 
have got themselves lived out, large and constant views of the meaning, 
uses, and end of human life, usually blossom out in great monuments, 
almost as naturally as the thought of the brain leaps to the tongue and 
clamors for expression.</p>

<p>It was as a <i>religion</i> that Catholicism dominated the Middle Ages. 
The natural monuments of a religion are its temples. You may simplify a 
religion as you will, curtail its functions, reduce its influence -- 
but so long as it<!-- pg 314 -->pretends to bind man with his Maker, so long 
will it need places of meeting for its people, and so long will it set 
up therein some symbol or symbols of its creed.</p>

<p>The refined paganism of Greece and Rome, with which Catholicism came 
into conflict, had such popular centres of worship -- the temples and 
shrines of its gods. But paganism had nothing truly spiritual about it. 
It was all based on fear of its deities, was a religion solely of low 
and coarse propitiation, a mass of deceptive practices, a double 
religion -- base superstition for the multitude, quasi-agnosticism for 
the elevated classes. It had no fixed doctrine to preach. It had no 
central fire of love to which all were bidden, no mystic banquet, no 
divine revelation to communicate. Hence, its temples were only abodes 
of the mysterious deity. He alone dwelt behind marble walls, within 
which, as a rule, only the priest went and the needed servants. 
Outside, on the temple-square, stood the multitudes, watching the 
evisceration of sheep and oxen, or the other mummeries of paganism, but 
utterly without any serious share in the act of religion that was 
entirely the affair of the priests and the magistrates, a State act.</p>

<p>With the Christians, from the very beginning, <!-- pg 315 -->it was otherwise. 
They were one body with Jesus Christ, their mystic head. They had been 
all born again in Him, and the true death was to lose that new higher 
life. They were destined to union with Him in eternity. They had His 
history in four little books, and the letters of His first agents, the 
apostles. He had fixed a certain form for their meetings, that were to 
be very frequent, and at which all who confessed His name should assist 
and partake of a divine banquet that was none other than His own body 
and blood.</p>

<p>So the Christians needed a large, free space, where all could see one 
another, where all could hear, where access was easy to the eucharistic 
table or altar, around which the ministers of the banquet could serve 
the presiding officer and distribute to all the assistants, in an 
orderly way, the celestial food. The God of the Christians was no 
longer far away. He was with them day and night. He spoke to them all 
with equal love, and demanded from all an equal service. In other 
words, the doctrine of the Blessed Sacrament, of the Real Presence, 
demanded at once and created all the essentials of a Christian church, 
such as they are found in the catacombs and such as they will exist as 
<!-- pg 316 -->long as the religion itself -- a table for the sacrifice, a 
space for its ministers, an open space sufficient for the assistants, 
light for the performance of the mysteries in which all were sharers 
and, in a true but mysterious sense, actors, light also for the reading 
of the gospels, the Old Testament, the letters from distant brethren, 
the accounts of martyrdom. In time, the pagan had to be kept out, the 
novice admitted slowly, the unfaithful excluded and chastised for a 
time, the goods, deposits, plate, records, of the little communities 
stored away. Thus vestibules, courts, and sacristies were added. Thus, 
too, arose, almost in the Cenacle, the first Christian Church, all 
whose essential elements are curiously enough foreshadowed in the 
Apocalypse -- indeed, in the holy Temple of Jerusalem itself.</p>

<p>It is a long and charming chapter in the history of the fine arts how 
the typical Catholic Church grew up. There was the upper room in the 
residence of the principal Christian of the community; perhaps, too, 
they hired occasionally a public hall or reading-room. Then came the 
little chamber of some cemetery where an illustrious martyr lay. When 
freedom came, there was the little overground chapel, with its 
<!-- pg 317 -->triple apse and its roofless but enclosed courtyard, just over 
the martyr's resting-place; then the vast Roman halls of justice were 
abandoned to them. Sometimes the temples were transformed for Christian 
service. Soon they built their own -- at Rome St. Peter's and St. 
Paul's, the "Great Church" at Carthage, the "New Church" at Antioch, at 
Tyre. Emperors paid for them, and crossed the world to assist at their 
dedication. They were often of the style of the Roman courts of justice 
known as basilicas; again they were octagonal or round. Every city, 
every village, had its own. But whatever their form or material, they 
were places of meeting for a community of men and Women, therefore 
roomy and lightsome. By reason of the great central act of the 
religion, they were decently ornamented, provided with an elevated 
altar, beneath which lay the body of some distinguished martyr or 
confessor of Christ, whose death was the pledge of final victory over a 
bad and unjust society, a seal of hope, an assurance that with faith in 
Jesus Christ lay the only certainty of eternal life.</p>

<p>The first great Christian churches were owing to the constructive skill 
of Roman architects and builders. They embodied the best traditions of 
<!-- pg 318 -->imperial architecture, such at least as had survived into the 
fourth century. That they were not in absolute decay may be seen from 
the splendid ruins of the Palace of Diocletian at Salona. But, given 
the collapse of Roman power, the great building-arts could not long 
survive. Their traditions were easily lost for want of exercise. In the 
Christian Orient perhaps they lived on much longer, in Greek 
Constantinople, and the remnants of the Roman power that Islam did not 
absorb. But in the West a mysterious transformation took place. We quit 
the sixth century holding on to traditions of classical forms and 
workmanship at Rome and Ravenna, but we emerge into the seventh, in 
possession no longer of what is known as Roman architecture, but of 
what the historians of art are agreed to call Romanesque. For five 
hundred years nearly all the churches of Europe are ranged in this 
category. We have no longer in their purity the solemn, long nave of 
the basilica, with its noble monolith pillars, tied by correct round 
arches, on which rests the main roof, while the altar is in the apse, 
that is solidly built up and holds on its own semicircle of brick its 
suitable roof. If side-naves are needed, they are added from 
with<!-- pg 319 -->out, with their own columns, low roofs, and enclosing walls. 
In place of such majestic buildings that retained no little of the 
majesty of imperial Rome, and of which a specimen may yet be seen at 
Trier on the Moselle, or even in some Roman churches, we get smaller 
edifices. For the great monolith column there are low pillars, often 
made of separate stone drums. The arches are lower, more squatty, and 
depend on very thick walls for their support. The open upper roof of 
the old basilica gives way to a few narrow windows, mere apertures, but 
decorated with pretty colonnettes. An inside gallery, low and narrow, 
runs around the church just over the pillars. A low roof made of wooden 
beams gives an air of dimness and depression to the whole edifice.</p>

<p>Where did the Christian architects of Northern Italy, in whose cities 
it surely arose, get the essentials of this style? Did a school of 
genuine Roman architects and builders survive the downfall of their 
State and culture? Did they live on Lake Como, and perpetuate there the 
skill and cunning in building of their Roman ancestors? Are they the 
real builders of the first Lombard churches, the originators of 
Romanesque, that afterward was carried by them into <!-- pg 320 -->France, and 
Germany, and England, in which lands one beauty, one utility after 
another, was added, until such glorious old churches as Worms, Speyer, 
and others of the Rhineland, were created, until St. Ambrose at Milan, 
St. Michael's at Pavia, and many others, were either rebuilt anew or 
made over after the prevailing style? Or is the Romanesque church the 
result of inherited barbarian tastes and traditions struggling for 
expression at the hands of men yet raw in the history and forms of 
architecture? Is it the Greek architect of Constantinople, an exile, or 
a left-over from the ruinous exarchate at Ravenna, who himself 
executed, or gave the first impulse to those curious buildings in 
which, all over Europe, the traditions of Old Rome are seen to underlie 
a number of new principles and suggestions? Anyhow, Christian 
architecture from Roman became European by way of the Romanesque. 
Specimens of the latter soon arose in every land. The Roman architects 
and builders who followed St. Augustine to England, St. Boniface to 
Germany, built in that style. Those who crossed the Alps at the bidding 
of Charlemagne, and created the octagonal basilica of Aix-la-Chapelle 
for him, showed that they were masters of both Byzantine and 
Ro<!-- pg 321 -->manesque, for they left after them work of both kinds.</p>

<p>Somehow, even though imperfectly, the building-arts were yet taught in 
Italy, architecture was yet understood in the large style of the 
ancients. The great models of antiquity still existed -- for their 
final complete destruction dates from the late Middle Ages, not from 
the time we are dealing with. There was always kept up some interchange 
of influences between Constantinople and the West, at least until the 
Iconoclastic follies and excesses of the eighth century arrested the 
normal development of Christian art in its natural home. From the city 
of Rome in the West, and the city of Constantinople in the East, were 
kept up a constant supply and demand of all that pertained to building 
and the arts that depend on it.</p>

<p>It is now an exploded fable that there was in the year 1000 A.D. a 
general terror among the Christian peoples of Europe at the supposed 
approach of the end of the world. Nevertheless, the two hundred years 
that followed did see a general revival of human interests, owing to 
other reasons. With the civilizing of the Northmen, the last stages of 
the old classical world of Greece and Rome disappeared. <!-- pg 322 -->Latin 
ceased finally to be a spoken tongue. The new vernaculars made out of 
it began to move independently, to affect a higher range of activity. 
With these new instruments of thought the life of the peoples of Europe 
takes on a new character. The last border-land of the old and the new 
is reached. Right here Catholicism entered more profoundly than ever 
into the lives of these new and ardent peoples. Their wills and 
testaments show it. The population increased rapidly, new churches were 
built in great numbers, and old ones were restored or enlarged. 
Constant demand created a great supply of workmen. The intelligence of 
Italian and Greek architects, and the devotion and sacrifices of a 
great multitude of monks, brought about improvements in the ordinary 
Romanesque. Little by little it graduated into the incomparable Gothic. 
The round arch gave way to the pointed arch, that could be carried much 
higher, and needed for its support no thick and cumbersome walls, only 
a sufficient lateral resistance or pressure to prevent it from falling. 
Now the heavy stone piers could be reduced in size, the massive walls 
could be thinned down and cut out, until a new theory stood forth in 
practice -- the building was no longer a roof <!-- pg 328 -->resting on heavy 
walls propped up by thick piers that were themselves bound and dove-
tailed into the walls. It was now a great, open, airy framework, in 
which the tall main arches were caught precisely at their weakest point 
by slender but strong abutting piers. The roof rested partly on these 
arches thus secured, partly on slight but strong shafts engaged in the 
masonry of the great arches at their springing point. Across the nave 
independent arches were thrown, always pointed, that showed beneath 
each vault, upheld it, and produced the new and artistic effect of 
groining. The light spaces of the clerestory were now raised and 
widened; the spaces between the great lateral arches were also 
broadened, until at last almost no solid wall at all was left, nothing 
but the masonry built up beneath the huge glass windows to support 
their weight, and enclose the worshippers. Here at last was something 
absolutely new in architecture. Some modern scholars maintain that its 
first suggestions caine from Constantinople, or from Christian Antioch. 
Be that as it may, it was the genius of mediaeval Catholicism in the 
West that caught up the idea long dormant. In Normandy and the 
territory of Paris and OrlÇans, the new architecture first 
<!-- pg 324 -->spread. It is not German, it is not Italian or English. It is 
French in its original and purest monuments. When we look at the 
cathedrals of Chartres and Amiens, we see its loveliest chefs d'oeuvre; 
when we go through the ancient towns of Normandy, we see its first 
examples. Here in the north of France, during the first fifty years of 
its development, arose many specimens of the genuine Gothic, until all 
Europe caught the sacred fire. The new style spread from one land to 
another, was modified somewhat in each, reached its apogee in the early 
part of the fourteenth century, and then fell into a decline and disuse 
that it has recovered from only in the last century through the efforts 
of a Pugin in England and that Romantic movement in Germany which is 
identified with the completion of the cathedral of Cologne and the 
names of Joseph Gîrres, its philosopher, and August Reichensperger, its 
preceptor.</p>

<p>The mediaeval cathedral, house of prayer, museum, gallery of art works, 
in whatever way we look at it, was the great popular enterprise of that 
period. It arose gradually, through several generations, and is the 
true mirror of the ideals and endeavors of our mediaeval 
an<!-- pg 325 -->cestors. It furnished employment for the major part of the 
city's craftsmen. It stirred up rivalry and ingenuity, and brought 
together on one site a multitude of workers whose combined experience 
alone could raise such buildings. Industry and commerce flourished 
around it, good taste was exercised and developed by it -- the great 
triumphs of painting and sculpture in the fifteenth and sixteenth 
centuries are only the flowering of the good seed planted in the 
twelfth and thirteenth. The life of every family in the city was 
intimately bound up with the great monument that they had helped to 
build. Its windows held the portraits of their ancestors. Their arms 
were blazoned on many a glorious rose or chancel-light, while before 
the altar lay buried their parents and relatives. When Adam Krafft 
raised his ineffably beautiful slender tabernacle for the Blessed 
Sacrament at NÅrnberg, that reaches from floor to ceiling of the great 
church, he built it on the backs of bronze figures of himself and his 
assistants, each with his master's apron and tools. From his workshop 
to the altar of God there was but a step in his lifetime. And he wished 
it to be so forever.</p>

<p>It is the cathedral that kept alive good handi<!-- pg 326 -->work, for all the 
domestic architecture, all civic and military architecture, of the 
period is based on the religious, and only follows it, imitates it. The 
castle, the fortress, the city palace, the town-hall, the gates, the 
bridges, the guild-houses, all the civic buildings, copy their 
ornaments and decoration from the workshops of the cathedral, when, 
indeed, they were not built by the same architects and workmen. There 
they found the infinite variety of decoration, the models of bronze and 
iron work, the perfect forms of pointed window and stone mullion, the 
proportion of stories and cornice, the proper precautions for the roof 
and the eaves, the charming system of fresco-coloring and painted tile-
work that lent to every old mediaeval town, like Bruges or Freiburg, 
its haunting spiritualesque beauty, its distinctive <i>cachet</i> of 
personality.</p>

<p>This helps to explain another peculiarity of the great Gothic 
cathedrals. They had no architects in our modern sense of the word. 
There was, indeed, a great head whose general plans were known and 
followed out. But it was a time of <i>master workmen.</i> Every one fit 
to do any responsible work on the building was a finished artist in his 
own line. Moreover, he had usually a heart and an imagination, those 
true <!-- pg 327 -->sources of spontaneity and inventiveness. He had a personal 
fondness for his work, and a great pride in being a responsible agent 
in the common undertaking. The individual workmen had much freedom in 
the execution of their details, a circumstance that aided notably in 
impressing an air of distinction, a stamp of personal inventive finish, 
on every line and member of the work. Around such buildings as 
Strasburg and Paris, that were slowly carried to completion, arose 
<i>practical schools</i> of superior masonry, joiner and cabinet work, 
framing and mortising, carving in wood and stone. Originally all the 
workmen formed one great corporation, but in time the painters and the 
sculptors became conscious of their own importance, and established 
independent guilds or crafts. So with the others. But their real 
apprenticeship had been on the huge pile that overtopped everything in 
the city, and their best masterpieces were long to be seen only there. 
Sometimes one family worked for two hundred years or more at one 
particular line of occupation in the same building. Thus, all the 
mosaic altars in the great Certosa at Pavia were built from father to 
son for two hundred years by the Sacchi family. A moment's reflection 
will show that in such cases we almost touch <!-- pg 328 -->with the hand the 
original workmen of the thirteenth century. Elsewhere, in Northern 
Italy, one family built during three hundred years nearly all the fine 
churches of a whole extensive neighborhood.</p>

<p>It is not enough that we should know how a great cathedral got itself 
built up. It is well to know how it was administered and kept together. 
After all, it was a centre of good government, when good government was 
rare. At its head stood the bishop, elected for life. He was often a 
sovereign temporal authority, like the Bishop of Durham in England, or 
the great German elector-bishops of Cologne, Trier, and Mainz. In any 
case his authority was the source of all rights, and his will the 
normal spring of administration. For many centuries all his clerics 
lived with him, ate at the same table, and slept under the same roof. 
The temporal goods of the see were under the supervision of an officer 
known as the archdeacon, who also looked after the clergy. A cathedral 
school, where boys were brought up as in a seminary, where the young 
choristers were trained, was attached to the building. Other buildings 
were close by, apartments for the clergy of the cathedral, a house for 
the guests, the pilgrims, the poor penitent travelling <!-- pg 329 -->to Rome 
or to St. James in Spain. In England a noble circular hall, whose roof 
was upheld by a single pillar, was affected to the meetings of the 
clergy and to the synods. Numerous officials were on the personnel of 
the cathedral -- a master of the choir or precentor (a very important 
office), a chancellor or legal adviser and officer of the diocese, a 
treasurer, a dean or head of the chapter with its numerous priests or 
canons bound to sing the psalms at fixed times during the day, and to 
carry on the services of the cathedral according to the laws of the 
Church. A great number of laymen were usually attached to such a 
building -- caretakers, janitors, laborers, bailiffs, messengers -- 
sometimes the family of the bishop ran up to many hundred heads. A 
great wall was often drawn about the whole establishment, and the gates 
closed and patrolled at night as in a little fortress. With daybreak 
began the round of divine service that almost never ceased, the space 
between the High Mass and the Evensong or Vespers being filled up with 
many minor and local ceremonies of great interest -- in England, e.g. 
the distribution of the Holy Loaf, the chanting of the lovely Bidding 
Prayer, or public petitions for divine mercy, the calling over from the 
pulpit of the Bede-Roll <!-- pg 330 -->or names of dead benefactors, the 
chanting of litanies, the conduct of processions, and a hundred and one 
forms of religious life that kept the entire clerical force on their 
feet the livelong day. Besides the varied religious life of the 
cathedral itself, there was the wonderful social life without -- the 
weekly market, the pedlers and tradesmen, the ale-house that often 
belonged to the church, the great breweries for a people who seldom 
drank water, like the English and the Germans, the children at their 
games, the smithies wide open and resounding, the granaries and stores 
of the bishop. Between that cathedral and the next great church, there 
were only hamlets, some monasteries, small ones maybe, and an 
occasional nobleman's castle perched inaccessible on some high crag. As 
a matter of fact, here were the original elements of mediaeval civil 
life, here the germs out of which grew first most mediaeval cities and 
small States of Europe, and then our own civilization. When a man of 
learning and distinction, of high birth and great piety, like a 
Grosseteste of Lincoln, or a Maurice de Sully of Paris, or an Engelbert 
of Cologne, presided over such a work, one can imagine how close to 
ideal contentment the life of his people could come.</p>

<p><!-- pg 331 -->The decorations and furniture of the cathedral corresponded to 
the beauty of the structure. The altar arose on marble or bronze 
columns, sometimes resting on couchant lions or on human figures. 
Reliefs in marble or bronze decorated it. The costliest embroideries 
and laces were made for it; stuffs of gold brocade, and ornamented with 
precious stones, were hung upon it, worth a king's ransom. Embroidered 
frames, richly painted panels, were often used to embellish it on high 
festivals. Often a great baldachino, or open roof, held up by columns 
of costly material covered it. In Germany and elsewhere the altar 
worked gradually back from the front line to the wall of the apse, 
whither the relics were taken. In time they were put upon the altar 
itself, and thus arose the elegant reredos. It is all visible in the 
painted folding-doors that may yet be seen -- lovely work by the 
schools of Cologne or of Bruges, of Hans Memling or Albert DÅrer. The 
chalices of silver and gold were gems of artistic skill, covered with 
precious stones, engraved in niello, heavy with pearls and mosaic, 
decorated in arabesque or filigree. Though the smallest of them was of 
inestimable value, yet the richest was looked on as all too unfit for 
the holy service it rendered. From <!-- pg 332 -->being round and large they 
became tall and slender, according as they were more immediately for 
the personal use of the celebrant. The ciborium for the communion of 
the people, the pyx for the communion of the sick, the monstrance for 
the benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, were each a new object for 
the artist's taste and the generosity of the donor. For all of them the 
pointed arch of the Gothic fixed the shape and the details. The Mass 
and service books were of enormous size, made of the finest parchment, 
illuminated by the deftest hands, bound and ornamented with lavish 
fondness and a skill never since surpassed. Every vessel that was in 
any way connected with the eucharistic service became at once an art-
object -- the censer, the cruets, the basin, and even the candlesticks 
and candelabra, the Mass bells, the portable crosses, the reliquaries. 
Even when done in iron or brass, like the massive lecterns, these 
objects affected the most exquisite forms, and were the starting-point 
of the loveliest work that later generations expended on domestic 
interiors, or on buildings devoted to civic purposes. The baptismal 
fonts, round or octagonal, offered the sculptor an interesting field 
for his inventive genius, and even the well, always found in <!-- pg 333 -->the 
cathedral cloister or close, was often seized on for purposes of 
sculptural decoration. The empty spaces in the cathedral were gradually 
filled with splendid family tombs of marble or bronze, on which the 
symbolism of religion and heraldry disputed the palm with the truth and 
vividness of portraiture and history. The dead bishop and his canons 
were in time remembered for their services or their legacies. Thus 
every cathedral was soon a city of the dead, where the effigies of 
priest and layman, of abbess and noble dame, looked down from their 
silent places on the ebb and flow of the human life that they had once 
graced and enlivened. Never was there a more moving and romantic lesson 
of the transient nature of life than these great cathedral-spaces in 
their first days when the dead builders stared on the living, and the 
living felt that day by day they were only drawing closer to the 
beloved dead. Over them all there is even yet something of a sacrosanct 
Christian fondness --the knight cherishes yet his falcon or his hound; 
at the feet of the sweet chatelaine is yet carved the little spaniel, 
the companion of her leisure and the witness of her womanly virtues.</p>

<p>The railings of the choir, and the screens to separate it from the 
people, the screens for the <!-- pg 334 -->altar itself, the pulpit, the 
tabernacle, the reading desks for the daily office, the organ fronts, 
the stalls for the canons, the marble pavement, the entire furniture of 
the cathedral, were turned over to the artists as an inexhaustible 
province for their skill and genius.</p>

<p>Two great arts formed a congenial home in the Gothic cathedral -- the 
art of painting and the art of sculpture. The mediaeval man was color-
mad. We see the relics of his great monuments in a faded or colorless 
garb. When they issued from the hands of the architects and artists 
they were far different. The roof of the cathedral was finished in 
colored tiles -- red, blue, green --often in tasty designs. The walls 
within were tinted in fresh and pleasing colors, the carvings of the 
capitals brought out in red and blue and gold; in the vaults the 
groined ribs of stone were similarly treated, -- the doorways were 
painted and gilded, the pavements often done in mosaic, or in geometric 
patterns of colored marbles, the ceilings a deep blue, often dotted 
with little golden stars. Compositions of great size often adorned the 
vacant spaces -- here the "Madonna and Child," there "St. Christopher 
bearing the Christ-Child," here the "Dance of Death" with its stern 
comment on the vanity of human life, else<!-- pg 335 -->where the prophets and 
apostles, or martyrs and holy virgins and confessors, met the eye. 
Sometimes the interior is cold and severe, as at Marburg, and again a 
great blaze of blue and gold and red as at Assisi. It was the 
experience thus gained that prepared the way for the lovely Madonnas of 
the artists of Cologne and Bruges in the fifteenth century, the work of 
a Master Schîngauer and a Hans Memling, without which a DÅrer and a 
Raphael would be unintelligible.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the real immortal painting of the Gothic cathedral is not 
the fresco, no matter how perfect. It is always somewhat out of place 
and distracts the attention from the sublime simplicity of the 
architectural lines, from the religious severity of the tall open 
arches and the sombre masses of stone. Its true and natural painting is 
the great glass window. Indeed, when finished, a genuine Gothic 
monument is like a vast transparent house of glass. Originally the aim 
of the artist in colored glass was to give the impression of a great 
piece of tapestry covering the open space and toning down the garish 
light of day. Such tapestries had been much used in the earlier 
Romanesque churches, and were one great source of artistic education in 
the numerous nunneries. The bits of glass were put together like a 
mosaic, <!-- pg 336 -->each a separate bit, and leaded to one another. All 
drawing was in outline. It was a handsome shining tapestry that the 
artists desired to produce, and such is always the effect of the best 
glass, as at Chartres and Cologne. Later, as the windows became only 
frames for the imitation of painting in oil, the original artistic 
reason of the great glass windows was forgotten. The accessory had 
become the principal.</p>

<p>Although in the treatment of artistic glass, as in other details, there 
was in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries a rapid decline of 
intelligence and pure taste, one great effect was retained in every 
church that could at all call itself Gothic --an abundance of light, 
but toned down, softened, robbed of all its heat and blare and 
vulgarity. An air of religious mystery was thus created throughout the 
vast building, in which all things were seen indeed, but dimly and with 
a constant suggestion of the beyond, of a glory and a majesty to which 
these walls were but the vestibule. The city streets usually led up to 
the great portals of the cathedral, so much so that in time the lofty 
transept became almost a highway for the ordinary foot-traffic of the 
community. The mighty collective work of the population was ever in 
their very heart, a thing of beauty and <!-- pg 337 -->joy, all fresh and sharp 
in its carved surfaces, all grace and slender elegance in the upward 
sweep of its arches, its roof, its towers and spires, all solidity in 
its immovable piers and locked buttresses, all variety in the flashing 
colors of the tiled roofs and spires, the native hues of the local 
freestone or granite, the broken lines of the external framework, all 
utility in the thousand uses of daily life for which, little by little, 
every member of the splendid pile had been excogitated, all harmony in 
the blending of imperishable material, plastic forms, moulding genius -
- one mighty architectonic idea imprisoned, but barely imprisoned, 
throbbing day and night with a celestial music akin to that which the 
starry spheres are said to emit in their courses. Its glorious chimes 
flung out the praises of God from a perfect metal, the like of which 
has never been reproduced in later centuries. But the showering 
melodies that they loosened in the upper air were as silence compared 
with the voice of the vast mass itself. It was one great psalm of 
praise and prayer --the incarnation, as it were, of the divine psalmody 
that went ceaselessly on beneath its fretted and painted vaults. Not 
without reason has such a building been called a poem in stone. No 
ordinary poem indeed, but a solemn epic, in which all <!-- pg 338 -->the uses 
of life are transfigured, smelted into unity, uplifted and set in 
living contact with the common Father in heaven. Chartres and Amiens, 
Rheims and Ronen, Cologne and Marburg, are as surely the interpreters 
of Catholicism in the Middle Ages as St. Thomas and Dante --nay, in one 
sense more so -- for such solitary voices appealed largely to the 
reason, or to the reasoning fancy, whereas the Gothic cathedral soars 
at once beyond the weak discursive or analytic methods, appeals at once 
to the common heart of the city, the multitude, to all its common 
emotions, all its collective experiences. It calls out all the idealism 
latent in the most sluggish soul. The history of the Catholic Church, 
seen from the proper view-point, is one of her greatest arguments, one 
of the deepest sources of her theology and her discipline. But its true 
folios are not the dusty volumes that lie upon the shelves of 
libraries. They are rather those great religious buildings of the 
Middle Ages, every one of which was a forum for the broadest 
discussions that could engage human thought, every one of which is as a 
leaf in the annals of her civilizing energy. Who can look upon the 
white head of Shasta and not feel that peace descends upon him and 
enfolds him with her wings? So no one can suffer the <!-- pg 339 -->vision of 
Strasburg or Freiburg, and not experience a great stilling of the 
heart, a sensation as of a mother resting her soft palm on one's 
fevered brow and looking into the eyes unutterable thoughts of pity and 
consolation and relief.</p>

<p>What is the cause of this sentiment so universal that it cannot be 
gainsaid? It is something similar to the power exercised over the 
imagination by a battle-field, an Austerlitz or Waterloo, by the ruins 
of some great city, Carthage or Antioch or Rome. There the most awful 
experiences of man with man have gradually but inseparably blended with 
the surroundings. Here the dealings of God with man lend an unspeakable 
dignity to the scene of such great mysteries. For centuries the Saviour 
of mankind has dwelt beneath those holy roofs until every detail, every 
ornament, every element, has become in some way familiar with Him. For 
centuries the sacraments of the Catholic Church have been administered 
at those altars, and her solemn services have resounded in every corner 
of those vast edifices. For centuries a public worship, the offering of 
the whole heart of man -- the act of the society as of the family -- 
has developed and grown in manifold novelty and charm. In all this long 
time those huge spaces have been the meeting-places of <!-- pg 340 -->heaven 
and earth, and if some of the dust and stain of the material garment of 
man still cling to them, they are also full to overflowing of angelic 
presences and divine emanations. If the muddy currents of life have 
left their irregular line along the foundations, there cling to every 
altar and shrine countless sighs of genuine repentance, of ecstatic 
fondness for Jesus, of longing to be one with Him. There is everywhere 
the aroma of human tears, and human sorrows that are beyond the poor 
relief of tears. There are the cries of oppressed innocence, of hunted 
virtue, of outraged justice, of equity foiled and scorned. If each of 
these noble buildings is a museum, a gallery, immeasurably more 
instructive than the big lumber-rooms which are dignified with such 
titles, it is also a battle-field, where the wrestlings of the spirit 
and the conquests of grace fill out the conflict.</p>

<p>Of our poor little lives, made up of the smiles of joy and the tears of 
woe, the greater part is generally concern and solicitude. Still, there 
is the usual percentage of recreation and merriment, without which each 
heart would cease to be social, and life become an utter burden. So it 
came about that the Gothic cathedral was not all a creation of 
unrelieved earnestness. True <!-- pg 341 -->religion, though grave and 
thoughtful, is also joyous and refined. It has ever been a note of 
genuine Catholicism that it is in many things the enemy of the extreme; 
the philosophy of moderation. In its palmiest days the Gothic 
architecture made a place for the humorous and grotesque, unconsciously 
perhaps, but instinctively. It was truly the expression of real life, 
public and private. So, with photographic accuracy, every side of that 
life must be reproduced. By a great and, natural law that ran through 
the building from corner-stone to spire, everything must be not only 
useful, but beautiful, must be treated and finished artistically. For 
instance, the ugly water spouts, originally of lead and marble, ran out 
eventually into monstrous heads known as gargoyles. All the fabled and 
fantastic beasts of the imagination were made to do similar service. 
The horror of sin, the reign of Satan, were here symbolized in a way 
that was dear to the mediaeval mind, quite attached to the external and 
visible, inexperienced in the realm of pure reason and cold exact 
logic. Here were sermons in stone for the peasant as he looked up on 
market-day at the vast parapet of Rheims or Strasburg. Similarly, in a 
thousand corners of the building, the free-<!-- pg 342 -->working fancy of the 
artist moulded itself in a multitude of caricatures either personal or 
symbolical. Sometimes the carving monk cut out a hideous head of his 
abbot, guilty of too severe principles, too much addicted to penances 
of bread and water. Sometimes the workmen made ridiculous figures of 
one another or gave flight to pure invention in the reign of the 
grotesque. Oftener, however, some general law of symbolism runs beneath 
all these excrescences of humor. The mediaeval man was very much 
addicted to satire of. a drastic type. He must see his victim wince and 
writhe, must know that the stripe cut into the bone. Yet it was a very 
healthy thing, and if the clergy, as the ruling power, got their share, 
perhaps more than their just share, they did not complain. The severest 
caricatures are precisely on the carved seats of the great choir where 
the bishop and his priests might gaze almost hourly on them and 
remember that the world had eyes and ears and a good smart tongue, even 
if it did not know Latin and could only pray on its beads. The cunning 
fox come to grief, the gaunt robber wolf laid low, the vanity of 
gluttony and impurity, the fate of pride and injustice, the shame of 
meanness and avarice, the comic effects of sloth and stupidity, 
<!-- pg 343 -->-- all these and many other moral lessons were thereon written 
so large that he must be deaf indeed for whom the stone and wood of his 
very seat did not daily preach a convincing lesson, did not daily rouse 
the voice of conscience and the longing for a better life.</p>

<p><i>Where did the funds come from</i> that built these mighty edifices? 
Not a few were put up by royal generosity; others by public taxation. 
But even in such cases individual help was solicited and given very 
largely. We have yet the account-books of some of these enterprises, 
and the entries are very curious. Much of the material -- the marble, 
granite, brick, wood --was contributed gratis. A multitude of peasants 
offered their horses and oxen and carts to transport the same, and when 
they were too poor to own such property, they gave their time and 
labor. Women and children even stood by to contribute such help as 
their weak hands might offer. Every one felt that here a solemn act of 
religion was going on, something that transcended all ordinary 
enterprises. With that strong collective sense that the Church has 
developed, they moved on, as one man, to the creation of a monument 
that should bear the stamp of faith -- immortality, eternity. Hundreds 
of <!-- pg 344 -->noble churches were built in this way, even in small 
villages. To build a large and lovely house of God, and to dwell within 
the shadow of its graceful spire, was the one common purpose of every 
community from Sicily to Norway. One deep vivifying current of religion 
surged through all Europe, and where it passed, edifices of the highest 
beauty arose, each an incarnation of profound religious temperament, 
each a phase of a social life that recognized gratefully the existence 
of God as the Father of human society, and the public duty of the 
latter to Him. The very poorest contributed -- on the account-books we 
may yet read how one gave a bed, another a coat. The knight sacrificed 
his gilded helmet and his blade of Damascus, with his coat-of-mail. The 
parish priest gave up his tithes, the curate his modest salary. The 
lady sent in her laces and jewellery, the women of the people their 
little heirlooms of gold or silver, even such neat and desirable 
articles of clothing as they possessed. The farmer gave his best cow, 
the pedler offered a choice trinket, the serf came up with his weekly 
wages. And when men and women were too poor to give anything as 
individuals, they clubbed together in little associations. Their 
pennies soon swelled to <!-- pg 345 -->silver, and the silver was turned into 
gold, and with the gold they cast in their hearts, and so the stones of 
the building got each a tongue that is yet eloquent with praise of the 
popular devotion. Much of the money was gotten by the weekly auction of 
these articles that was carried on in the public square by the foreman 
of the works. Indeed, the whole enterprise was like a majestic social 
song, a solemn hymn, whose notes rose slowly and sweetly from the earth 
to heaven, telling of the transformation of avarice into open-
handedness, of coarsefless into refinement, of selfishness into 
altruism, of blank ignorance and stupidity into a creative faith. 
Prayer and adoration, propitiation and gratitude, were finely blended 
in the great popular chorus. King and serf, princess and milkmaid, pope 
and poor sacristan -- the whole of Europe moved in a vast procession 
before the throne of Jesus Christ, and cast each a stone on the 
memorial pile of religion. And, for the first time, the quasi-divine 
hand of art, made infinitely cunning, transformed these crude offerings 
into ten thousand caskets of rarest beauty, out of which rose forever 
the spiritual incense of love, the ravishing aroma of adoration, the 
delicate perfumes of humility and human charity, the sweet odor of 
<!-- pg 346 -->self-sacrifice. For a short time in the history of mankind art 
was truly a popular thing, truly an energizing softening influence on 
the common heart. Insensibly artistic skill became common and native. 
The hand of the European man was born plastic and artistic. His eye was 
saturated with the secrets of color, his imagination crowded with the 
glories of form in line and curve, in mass and sweep. His own 
surroundings were insensibly dominated by the spirit of pure beauty. He 
was once more a Greek, only born again in Jesus, and seeing now, with 
the divinely soft eyes of the God-man, a spiritual world of beauty that 
Phidias and Praxiteles may have suspected, but only in the vaguest 
manner.</p>

<p><i>Who were the actual workmen on the cathedrals?</i> They were built 
by corporations of workingmen known as guilds. In the Middle Ages all 
life was organized, was corporative. As religion was largely carried on 
by the corporations of monks and friars, so the civic life and its 
duties were everywhere in the hands of corporations. It was not exactly 
a government of the multitude -- that was abhorrent to the men of that 
time. It was rather an aristocratic democracy, a kind of government in 
which men shared authority <!-- pg 347 -->and power, according to the stake 
they had in the State, according to their personal intelligence and 
skill, and their personal utility or serviceableness to the common 
weal.</p>

<p>These building corporations or guilds arose out of the very ancient 
unions of the stonemasons. Perhaps, very probably, these unions were 
never destroyed even by the first shock of barbarian conquest. On its 
very morrow palaces and churches and public buildings had to go up or 
be restored. It is certain that capable hands were forthcoming. In any 
case, the master-masons were more than mere stonecutters. They were 
artists in the truest sense of the word. They must know the capacities 
of their material, its uses, its appliances, from the moment it is hewn 
out of the earth to the moment it shines in the wall, all elegance and 
strength. They were at once engineers and architects, designers and 
contractors. They are known simply as "Master" -- no more. Master 
Arnulf builds the cathedral of Florence, Master Giotto builds its 
lovely tower or campanile. The masters are all bound together in a 
lifelong union. Their apprentices serve a long term of years, but they 
serve on all parts of the building. They can handle the trowel and the 
chisel, the pencil and brush, as well <!-- pg 348 -->as the jack-plane and the 
hammer. Never was there so unique and so uplifting an education of the 
senses as that of the mediaeval apprentice. One day he will appear in 
the weekly meeting of the guild, and exhibit some object that he has 
himself made. It must be useful, and it must be beautiful. It must 
differ from all similar work, must have an air of distinction, be 
something highly personal and characteristic. This is the masterpiece, 
the proof that he is fit to apply for work in London or Dublin, Paris 
or Milan. It may be a hinge or a door-knob, a carved head or a tool, a 
curious bit of framing or a specimen of filigree. It is judged by the 
criteria I have mentioned, judged by his peers and elders. If accepted, 
he passes into their society, and is assured of occupation for his 
lifetime.</p>

<p>He will now attend the meetings, pay his dues to support the sick and 
crippled members, assist with advice and help at the general 
consultations, devote his whole time and being to the progress of the 
cathedral. Whether stonecutter, carver, joiner, ironsmith, goldsmith, 
cabinet-maker, it is all one. The building arts are equal, ensouled by 
one spirit, and aiming at one end. For the present, there is but one 
oorporation on the building. It includes all the <!-- pg 349 -->workers, and is 
divided into masters, apprentices, and administration. This is the 
Lodge, the BauhÅtte, the Laubia or covered cloister -- like the covered 
walk quite common in North Italian cities -- where the finer carving 
was done, the plans kept and studied, and moneys taken in, the wages 
paid out, and the whole work or "opera" administered. The shed that yet 
protects our stonemasons when engaged at a public work is the modern 
equivalent of the mediaeval Lodge.</p>

<p>On signing the articles of the union or guild, he will learn that it is 
intensely religious, that he must attend Mass Sundays and holydays, 
lead a moral and Catholic life, abstain from swearing, drunkenness, and 
immorality. He will learn that the guild supports its own chapel and 
priest to say an early Mass daily for them. He will be told that the 
Lodge, or workshop, is like a hall of justice, where the rights of each 
man, above all his free personality; must be respected. He will learn 
that all teaching is free to apprentices, and that, while there is a 
preference for the sons or relatives of the masters, natural aptitude 
and vocation are especially sought for. All this he will learn at Ely 
or Peterborough as well as at Toledo or Burgos.</p>

<p><!-- pg 350 -->Each guild was under the protection of the Blessed Trinity and 
some saint. It had solemn services once a year in honor of its patron. 
It buried solemnly its members, and held anniversary services. 
Gradually its own chapel became the centre of its religious life, whose 
details were carried on by its own priests. Religion covered every act 
of its corporate life -- and in the palmy days of the great guilds 
their self-consciousness was striking. They bowed to the bishop, 
indeed, and the pope, king, or emperor, who were often included as 
members of their roll-call -- but he was truly a strong parish priest 
or abbot whose authority they consented to acknowledge.</p>

<p>In the guild meetings a regular and perfect administration, of great 
probity and equity, went on, almost unremunerated. The number of 
apprentices, the time of their service and the degree of their 
graduation, the quality and quantity of work in each line, the disputes 
and quarrels between all workmen, the wages and the sick dues, the 
charity allowances, the expenses of religion, of feasts and amusements, 
of public contributions -- all these came up in due order, and were one 
open source of popular education for the uses of real life.</p>

<p><!-- pg 351 -->The guild, being a principal element of the civic life, soon had 
its badges of office, its mace and golden collar, its chains and rings, 
its great drinking-horns and table-plate of gold and silver, its 
countless beautiful masterpieces. It grew rich in lands and revenues, 
and was a factor to be counted with in every great struggle of the 
municipal life. In Italy the guilds play a principal role in the fierce 
historical warfare of Guelf and Ghibelline, the adherents of the pope 
and the partisans of the emperor. They are concerned in every social 
and political movement, sometimes on the right side, sometimes on the 
wrong, and it is largely in their history that must be studied the 
fatal decay of the democratic spirit of the High Middle Ages.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose to treat of their decline, and the reasons for it 
-- that chapter of their history is highly instructive even now. 
Suffice it to know that they were the real builders of the cathedral; 
that the principles and spirit of genuine Christian brotherhood were 
long the bond that held them together; that they were the creation of 
Catholicism at the height of its earthly power; that they looked on 
mutual respect and helpfulness as essential to society; that they held 
labor to be the noblest of human <!-- pg 352 -->things; that they looked on 
beauty as an essential of true labor, its smile of contentment, its act 
of divine adoration; that they were guided by a sense of moderation and 
fairness in all their dealings; that waste of time and dilapidation of 
material were looked on as sinful and shameful; that in them each man 
felt himself a living self-determining element, a member of the whole 
work, and threw himself into it with a vigor and earnestness at once 
entire and affectionate.</p>

<p>Thus the building arose in an atmosphere of religion, all its lines 
laid by men to whom its future uses were sacred, whose families threw 
back into the common treasury the surplus of the master's earnings. It 
was a great trust that was laid on the city -- and its execution 
brought out in the citizens many of the virtues that trust creates -- a 
sense of responsibility, prudential measures, economic foresight, calm 
and large and disinterested counsel. In so far as we inherit many 
distinctive traits of this kind from our ancestors, it is the mediaeval 
church-building that helped originally to create them.</p>

<p>In her great cathedrals, therefore, the Catholic Church has created 
durable edifices of popular utility and perfect beauty. The old 
philosophers used to say that the beautiful was the splendor <!-- pg 353 -->of 
the true, in which case the truth of Catholicism as the genuine 
religion of the people would be amply vouched for. All the arts are 
dependent on architecture and conditioned by it. Without its great 
spaces there is neither monumental painting nor sculpture, neither 
music in its highest forms nor the dramatic movement of public worship. 
In creating the noble cathedrals of Europe Catholicism thus created the 
fine arts, or at least was their nurse and protector. Music, indeed, is 
absolutely her creation, and can never utterly break away from its 
original home, however wild and wayward it may seem. It is not the 
pipes of Pan nor the songs of Apollo that echo even in our most debased 
modern music. It is the psalm of David, the canticle of the martyr, the 
praiseful hymn of the morning and the calm sad song of evening.</p>

<p>The cathedral was the workshop of the Church during the Middle Ages. It 
was vast because she had the whole city to train up. It was open on all 
sides, because she was the common mother of civil society. It was high 
because she aimed at uplifting both mind and heart, and making for them 
a level just below the angelical and celestial. It was manifold in its 
members and elements, for she permeated all society and 
<!-- pg 354 -->challenged every activity and every interest. It was all 
lightsome and soaring, because it was the spiritual mountain top whence 
the soul could take its flight to the unseen world of light and joy. It 
was long drawn out because the long journey of life ends happily only 
for those who rest in Jesus. It lay everywhere cruciform on the earth, 
for the shadow of the cross falls henceforth over all humanity, 
blessing, enfolding, saving. Never did any institution create a 
monument that more thoroughly expressed its own scope and aims than the 
Catholic religion, when it uplifted the great mediaeval cathedral. It 
is said that since the unity of Christendom was broken at the 
Reformation no more harmonious bells have been cast like those of the 
Middle Ages. So, too, no more great cathedrals have arisen -- in more 
senses than one the mould was broken from whence they came, the deep, 
universal, practical, intensely spiritual faith of humanity that for 
once transcended race and nation, set aside the particular and 
discordant, and created things of absolute harmony, and therefore of 
beauty as absolute as man may evoke from the objects of sense.</p>
