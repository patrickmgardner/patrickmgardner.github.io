<h1>St. Thomas and Modern Thought</h1>

<b>Address delivered by Edward A. Pace before the Catholic University of America on the feast of St. Thomas Aquinas, March 1896.</b>  <i>Catholic University Bulletin</i>, Volume II (1896), pages 188-197.<p>

Example is a factor in the life of institutions no less
than in the life of individuals.  Where men are banded
together for the attainment of a common purpose, the
right understanding of that purpose is the first requisite
for success.  But the bond of union is strengthened, and
action becomes more effective, when the ideal is held up
in the concrete form of example. It is thus that the
patriot lives on in the nation and that the saint is a force
in the Church.  It is thus, too, that wise men are a power
in the world, not alone for the learning they gather or the
knowledge they impart, but also and chiefly because their
work invites others, encourages others, to imitate and
perchance to surpass them.<p>

A university, as the very name implies, is an assemblage 
of men devoted to the pursuit of knowledge.  As the
branches of knowledge are multiplied, the departments of
the university, and consequently the workers in each 
department, become more numerous, the general scope of the
institution is specified in different ways, and the work of
each member runs in particular lines. Yet, as all these
converge upon Truth as their goal, they must be guided
by a common impulse. They must be united by organization
and by a still stronger bond, the conviction that Truth
is one though the paths that lead to it are many.<p>

In the School of Philosophy, where differentiation is
rapid, it is specially needful that cohesive influences should
make themselves felt.   It is well that we regard the chief
aim of this school not only as an ideal that may be realized, 
but also as a reality accomplished by one of the
world's master minds. And it is meet, on this patron's
day, that we clearly conceive, in order to take them more
deeply to heart, the lessons which the master has taught us.<p>

Thomas Aquinas, Dominican Friar, sometime professor
in the universities of Paris and Naples, died March 7,
1274.  In 1879 Leo XIII formally restored the Thomistic
system as the model and norm of Catholic teaching, at
the same time proclaiming its author the patron of all
Catholic schools.<p>

The period bounded by these two dates is the most
remarkable in the Christian era, and in many respects the
most important in the history of the human race. Great
events are crowded into it, epochs that stand forth as land
marks on the high-road of time, transformations that have
affected, and still affect for weal or for woe, the vital 
interests of humanity.<p>

Divisions in religious belief have led one portion of
even the Christian world to discard the ideals which the
other still reveres.  Political revolutions, tending gradually 
to the severance of Church and State, have also set
farther and farther apart the influences which should
govern our spiritual life and the conditions which determine 
our ordinary occupations. The march of intellect
has brought us new forms of thought and expression, new
fields of investigation, new methods by which to explore
them, new standards by which to judge the results.  What
then, except we be historians, is the past to us?  We are
no doubt a product of that past.  To it and to the laws of
human development we owe our present. In it we may
yet discern elements of beauty that have not come down
to us -- evidences of skill, of high-flown fancy, of daring
intelligence, of heroic aspiration -- for which neither the
modern hand nor the modern mind can offer an equivalent.
But for all that, what is the past to us when our eyes are
fixed on the future?  The more justly we appreciate that
which is by studying that which has been, the more 
confidently do we turn to that which shall be. If history
shows us that the present is the outcome of a growth, 
reflection tells us that a greater growth is yet to come.  If
science astonishes us with what it has achieved, it reminds 
us in the same breath that we are only at the beginning 
of marvels.  If we pause for a moment to admire what
individuals have done, we are quickly admonished that
the whole race is moving on to a higher goal, as our
planetary system and its sun are advancing through
space towards a dimly-seen star. What, therefore, does
the past signify; what especially is our concern with that
mediaeval past which to so many minds appears as a cloud
bank resting on the heights of the sixteenth century?
What is there, above all, in the life or works of a mediaeval 
monk that should call us together from our libraries
and laboratories, from the living issues of our day and its
busy pursuits, to do him honor?<p>

When we go back in imagination to the golden age of
Scholasticism and realize how keen was the competition
of intellect, we can understand why Thomas Aquinas, with
his depth and subtlety and clearness, was the object of
enthusiastic admiration among the passionate lovers of
learning who gathered in the schools of Paris. When we
consider the purity of this life, his humility, his faith, his
calmness in the hour of success, and his steadfast refusal
of ecclesiastical preferment, we must acknowledge that the
Church but gives him his due by honoring him as a saint.
When we open his writings and discern beneath their rigid
form the erudition of a scholar and the grasp of a master
mind in dealing with the most sublime and difficult problems, 
we are ready to salute him as a Doctor of the Church,
even as the Doctor Angelic.  But when we rise from our
study and glance upon the world about us we may still
be inclined to ask: What claim has Aquinas upon the 
respect of this age -- what actuality does he possess for us
after the lapse of six hundred years?<p>

To justify this claim, to make this actuality, so to
speak, palpable, we must first of all lay hold upon that
which is essential in our modern intellectual life, and then
make it clear that St. Thomas possessed and manifested
this vital characteristic, not merely in an ordinary fashion,
but also in a surpassing degree.  We must convince ourselves 
that St. Thomas is more than a genius to be admired --
that he is a model to be imitated. And we must be assured
that in following his example, we neither retrograde in our
views nor surrender what modern thought has accomplished, 
but rather come closer to that harmonious unity
of knowledge in which we hope to find truth.<p>

Purposely I say, we must lay hold upon the essentials
of our modern intellectual life.  We must do so in justice
to ourselves. For what is of greatest value in any age is
not so much the multitude of isolated discoveries or
brilliant theories, as the underlying and often undiscovered
trend of thought which sets research in given directions
and strikes a just balance between the results. Again, we
must remember that in comparison with the hypotheses
advanced and the number of erroneous interpretations
put upon established facts, the net profit which endures
is small -- so small that we might be discouraged were it
not for the thought that such is the law of progress --
each wave advancing a little higher on the sands, then
rolling back, while the tide itself steadily rises. It is the
tide of intellectual advance and, more specially, the force
which urges it forward that we must apprehend, if we
would rightly appreciate the best elements of modern
thought, and discover their real significance.<p>

To such an appreciation we are bound, moreover, by
justice to those who have gone before us, and, what chiefly
concerns us here, in justice to St. Thomas. I do not
mean that we are to regard him with a sort of admiring
pity, as though he stood out isolated and alone, a sublime
exception to the spirit of his age. For in that age neither
talent nor eagerness of inquiry, neither bold initiative
nor manly independence was wanting. But, in fairness,
we <i>must</i> allow for the fact that, in the thirteenth century,
many of the sources of knowledge which we now enjoy
were still hidden from view, and many of the appliances
by which we now profit were not even dreamed of as fair
possibilities. The methods of research so productive in
modern science, the means of communication which in
our day annihilate space and time, the material needs
which stimulate investigation and give it a  practical
turn -- all these were lacking in the age to which St.
Thomas belonged. To judge him, therefore, by his acquaintance 
with this or that branch of natural science, to
ask whether he favored the hypothesis of the ether or of
natural selection or of space with a fourth dimension, is
simply beside the question.  To compare him with Newton,
or Harvey, or Lavoisier, is consequently far from our present
purpose. And it would obviously be out of place to ask
whether his works afford guidance in the methods of empirical 
research, or give clues to the solution of problems
which only research could suggest.<p>

But what we may ask, justly and confidently, is this:
Does not St. Thomas exemplify in a singular degree the
aspiration and the intent which deeply yet powerfully
moves the scientific endeavor of our age?<p>

Consider with me for a moment the growth of our
knowledge. Back of phenomena lie hidden their causes.
Binding cause and effect are nature's unchangeable laws.
Underlying these laws and enveloping these phenomena
is a Power, which manifests itself alike in the atom and
in the Universe. To co-ordinate a multitude of facts and
make them converge upon a single great truth, to merge
seemingly separate truths in a higher all-satisfying 
concept, to pierce through the manifold of appearance to the
ultimate reality beneath -- in a word, to reach simplicity
where all is complex, unity through the veil of variety --
such is, in its highest phase, the aim of intellectual effort
-- the essential element in our modern intellectual life.<p>

This passion for unity means more than an attempt at
consistency; it aims at identification. It is not content
with the orderly survey of Nature's manifestations; it
seeks a supreme formula in which they shall all be embraced
and explained. It overrides our divisions of
knowledge, asserts itself in every branch of our science,
and seizes on each product of research, standing guard at
the mouth of the mine where thousands are delving for
treasure.<p>

To physical science, in exchange for innumerable effects,
wrought as once we supposed by as many differing agencies, 
it has given the principle that energy is one in spite
of its transformations. To the science of life, just aglow
with the mastery of structure and function and form, it
declares -- all that now lives is but an upgrowth through
countless variations from germs that we despise or know
not -- but the process of life is one. To the science of
mind, proudly aloof from the cycle of material causation
it rudely proclaims, though not without some hesitation: 
dualism is no more, the substance of spirit is dissolved,
for body and mind, in a deeper unknowable depth, are
one.<p>

Then laden with the spoils from our knowledge of
nature and life and man, the craving for unity comes to
philosophy and demands a final accounting. And philosophy, 
hard though it be to speak, feels that silence is
harder still. Philosophy, too, has a unity, an ultimate
unity, in which the most stubborn opposition disappears
So that, looking abroad upon the entirety of things, philosophers 
assert: the universe is one in all its component
parts, and one with that Being which is the soul of the
world, which unfolds its activity in all phenomena, which
thinks in our thought, and thinking formulates the law
which we call evolution, which is in turn but the law of
its manifestation.<p>

In what measure these far-reaching attempts at unification 
may be said to succeed, or how far they may satisfy
the innate craving of our minds, we need not for the
present discuss. Whatever be their value, according to
this or that standard, they are certainly indications of
one and the same spirit, tendencies with one and the same
direction; and for our purpose this is sufficient. At all
events it is not their daring that we can condemn, nor the
difficulty of their undertaking that should lead us to
doubt. For if the task of science and philosophy seem
arduous, what shall we say of the effort to harmonize both
science and philosophy with the teachings of Faith? In
the one case, bold as speculation may be, it is still within
the limits of reason; in the other, reason is brought face
to face with that which immeasurably transcends it. In
the one case our intelligence but labors to set its own
products in order; in the other, it has to take account of
truths that could only originate in the intellect of God.
Yet we know that it is the ambition of many an earnest
mind to show forth the sublime accord which unites the
human and the divine, the natural and the supernatural,
finite knowledge and infinite wisdom. Doubtless there
are higher motives prompting this endeavor, motives that
spring from a deep-seated reverence both for the dignity
of human reason and the sanctity of God's revelation.
Nevertheless, we may discern in this undertaking the 
irrepressible desire for unity, and since the manifesting of
this unity must be made in terms of our understanding
and in utterances of human language, we are in no way
surprised when theology proclaims: The truth that by
searching you have found out and the truth that God by
His Word bas revealed, are one.<p>

Thus, in all the departments of human learning, the
same spirit is at work, struggling on different planes for
the attainment of one and the same end. I say "struggling," 
because as time wears on, and as research multiplies 
the data of our knowledge or modifies our notions
of natural law, new horizons open up to our view. Where
a multitude is busy with analysis, comparatively few
maintain that mental grasp on which synthesis necessarily
depends. And fewer still are they who, with keen analytical 
insight, combine a synthetic mastery over the
widening domain of science.<p>

Of this rarer sort was Thomas Aquinas. No shade of
thought so subtle that it escaped him, no depth so 
profound but he fathomed it and explored its farthest 
recess. Where the finest of the Greeks had threaded his
way, Aquinas marched confidently; where the Fathers, in
passing, had gleaned, he found a harvest of untouched
meaning; where his fellow-scholastics paused, he took up
their work and led it with masterful strides to perfection.
But analysis, with all its thoroughness, was for him only
the means to an end, the necessary preparation for a vast
and final synthesis.<p>

To him, as to us, nature was a splendid unity; and
though he knew less than we know of nature's details, he
saw, as Aristotle had seen,  the ultimate principles in
which the study of nature must issue. Throughout all
change, whether of material constitution or of mechanical
motion, of organic function or of intellectual process, he
discovered the ceaseless alternation of activity and passivity, 
of actuality and potentiality. In every transition
from the imperfect to the perfect and from the simple to
the complex, be beheld order and purpose and law. In
each phenomenon, be looked beyond the specialized form
of energy to the deeper impulse and influence of an 
all-pervading cause.<p>

But his unification of knowledge went farther. He
conceived the totality of things as proceeding from one
source and returning through the cycle of time and space
to one sovereign end, the source and the end being God.
Nor was God, to his way of thinking, an isolated, unknowable 
somewhat, entirety apart from the world. On the
contrary, St. Thomas emphatically teaches that a divine
energy is put forth in every production of nature's causation; 
as a consequence, that each physical process is a
manifestation of God's power; and, what may seem strange
to the modern mind, that each effect is more truly the 
outcome of God's omnipotence than of the physical agency
from which it immediately proceeds. Consequently, too,
in his eyes, each separate created being reflected, according 
to its measure of perfection, the wisdom and power of
God, as the tiniest drops of dew reflect the morning sun;
which creation as a whole shone as our planet shines, 
transfigured and illuminated with a radiance central and divine.<p>

Upon the mind of man, when properly adjusted, as
upon a mirror set true, fall these reflected rays, begetting
therein an image, small, yet proportionately just, of their
dazzling infinite source. And thus, from the things that
are made, we rise to a knowledge of their invisible Maker.
But because God, their Maker, is a personal God, infinite
mind and infinite will, in one; and because in the depths
of unlimited being and unbounded goodness there are
truths which no finite mind, of itself, can perceive; it is
possible, it is fitting, that God should make Himself known
by a more immediate revelation. To this direct effulgence
of divine truth Aquinas opened his mind, and realized in
a glance that it must be in unison with the truths which
nature and reason had taught him.   Not that he pretended 
to compass the ways of God, nor that he presumed
upon superhuman intuition, or even upon rational insight,
beyond what was granted his fellows. What convinced
him was the thought that God manifesting Himself in the
universe and God revealing Himself in His incomprehensible 
Word, is one and the same. Between the knowledge
that comes by seeing and the Faith that comes of hearing,
there is, and there can be, no suspicion of discord. Such
is the conviction that St. Thomas carries with him as he
approaches the several mysteries of Faith. Such is the
conclusion to which he returns and in which he abides
after scanning the page of revelation illumined by the
learning of the Fathers and the authoritative teachings of
the Church. In his mind, therefore, as expressed in his
writings, we behold the most perfect blending of natural
and supernatural truth. In his concepts, as in all created
modes of thought, the several beams of knowledge undergo
a refraction; but of the interference which means darkness, 
there is none.<p>

The science of our day, my friends, fills us with admiration 
of Nature' s beauty, because it shows us with the
lens of observation and the crucible of experiment, how
much is concealed beneath the humblest form and the
simplest function. Yet far above the wonders of the material 
world are the marvels contained in the lowliest act
of conscious life. And beyond these again our admiration 
stretches to the sublime synthetic endeavors of singularly 
gifted minds. That St. Thomas was endowed by
nature to an exceptional degree, that in his speculation
we find a model of synthetic comprehension, and that he
is, for this reason, a well-chosen patron of Catholic
scholars in our day, will be, I think, frankly admitted.<p>

But there is a fact to which, in conclusion, I would ask
your attention.  Not only has St. Thomas pointed the
path to synthetic knowledge; the man himself was a
synthesis.  He united the most brilliant intellectual attainments 
with the most solid and most attractive virtue.
His virtue was not of the showy kind; for him the parade
of piety possessed no charm. Humility did not bar him
from independence of thought; calmness did not subdue
his critical acumen; charity did not withhold him from
the exposure and censure of error wherever he found it.
In all these respects, he is the especial model of Catholic
teachers and Catholic students.  The more deeply we penetrate 
the secrets of nature, the more thoroughly we reconstruct 
the past of our race, the more keenly we analyze
the laws, the workings and the products of human intelligence, 
the greater reason have we for humbling ourselves
and acknowledging our ignorance.  And feeling how
limited is our own span of truth, we will readily make
allowance for those whose opinions we cannot logically
endorse.  We will gain their respect and mayhap their
love.  We will strive not merely for the unification of our
own ideas, but also, and principally, for the uniting of
all hearts and all minds.  We may not be rewarded with
instant success; but if we can convince men that their
installment of truth finds its complement and completion
in that which we offer them, a great deal will have been
accomplished.   We will have fulfilled the mission of a
Christian University in the nineteenth century; we will
have rendered the highest tribute in our power to the
Dominican friar of the thirteenth century, to Thomas, the
Angel of the Schools.<p>
