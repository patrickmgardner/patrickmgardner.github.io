<h3>CHAPTER III. ON GOOD AND EVlL IN HUMAN ACTS.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Whence are they derived?</h4><p>

Is every human action good, or are some evil?  What S. Thomas proved in 
<i>Pars Prima</i> is here to be remembered. For good and evil in 
actions are like good and evil in things, since each thing produces 
action according to its essential nature. Now it is a fundamental 
principle of truth, which was shown in Part I., that Good and Being are 
convertible terms. (Being is good, and the good is Being viewed as 
desirable.) As much of Being as anything possesses, so much of good it 
has. God alone has absolute plenitude of being. But each thing which He 
has made possesses such plenitude of being as He finds suitable for it 
according to its peculiar nature.  Some things, however, may have 
being, and yet lack that plenitude of being which they ought to have. 
Thus a man is compounded of body and soul, with all their suitable 
organs and powers. If any one of these is lacking, there is defect in 
his plenitude of being. Such defect is an evil. A blind man, 
<i>e.g.</i>, has the good of life, but he has also the evil of defect, 
his blindness. But if he lacked everything which belongs to being, we 
could not apply the words good or bad to him. Where there is defect, 
the thing is good <i>secundum quid</i>. I conclude, therefore, that 
every action, so far as it has being, has goodness; but so far as it 
lacks that plenitude of being which is due to human action, it is bad; 
<i>e.g.</i>, if it lacks the due quantity, or the due place, etc.  The 
evil acts by virtue of the deficient good. If there  
 were no good, there would be no being, no action. If there were no 
deficiency, there would be no evil in the being or in the action. So 
the action actually produced is in such a case a defective good, good 
<i>secundum quid</i>, but simply evil. <p>

Anything may be, in one regard, actual, in another deprived of 
actuality; and thus deficient action will be caused. A blind man has 
power to walk (which is a good); but wanting sight, he walks 
hesitatingly (which is an evil). <p>

An evil action may have some effect <i>per se</i>, which is in one way 
good, but evil as opposed to the due order of reason, e. g., conception 
following adultery.  <p>

<i>Does human action derive goodness or badness from its object?</i><p>

The kind of action is primarily determined by its object as the 
terminus of the action. Not, indeed, the object as viewed in itself, 
but in its relations to the actor, as in accordance or disaccordance 
with right reason so far as he is concerned. In this way actions are 
good or bad in their nature. Thus unjustly taking another's property is 
<i>malum per se</i>. <p>

In speaking of the object thus, I am not speaking of an external thing 
which is in itself a good, but of the related action. <p>

The goodness of the action is not caused by the goodness of its effect; 
but an action is called good because it can produce a good effect; and 
so the very relation of an action to its result is a cause of the 
goodness of that action.  <p>

<i>Is human action good or had according to the circumstances of it?</i><p>

I answer that the plenitude of being in (individual) action is not 
totally due to its nature, but also (in part) to the due circumstances. 
Hence, if anything be lacking in these due circumstances, the action is 
bad.  
<!--
Qu. XVIII. 3, 4, 5.] WHENCE DERIVED? 27 
--><A NAME="p27"></a><p>

<i>Is human action good or bad according to its end?</i><p>

(Here we speak, not of the intrinsic end which coincides with the 
object spoken of above, but of the extrinsic object.) This is the 
extrinsic cause of the action. Due portion and relation to that end is 
requisite in order to constitute the action good. <p>

So then, in human action there may be four-fold goodness: (1) in its 
genus, <i>sc.</i>, action; because as much of action and being as it 
has, so much it has of goodness; (2) in the kind of action, according 
as it has a fitting object; (3) in the accidental circumstances of the 
(individual) action; (4) according to the end, its relation to the 
goodness of its cause. <p>

Observe, however, with reference to this last, that this final cause 
may be only the seeming good, and so evil action may follow from it. 
And especially, it is to be noted that an action having goodness of one 
of these four kinds may be deficient in another of them. It may be good 
according to its species or its circumstances, and bad in the intention 
of the one who does the action. And an action is not simply good unless 
all four kinds of goodness are found in it.  <p>

<i>Does the end aimed at make an action specifically good or bad?</i><p>

Some acts are called human inasmuch as they are our voluntary acts. <p>

Now, in the voluntary act is found a two-fold action; one, the interior 
act of the will, another, the outward act. And eacli of these has its 
object. The end is the proper object of the inward voluntary act; but 
that about which the outward act is concerned is its object. And as the 
outward act takes its specific character from its object, the inward 
act gets its specific character (as good or bad) from the end sought 
for. But the outward acts are only moral so far as they are voluntary. 
We use our members 
<!--
28 GOOD AND EVIL IN HUMAN ACTS. [Qu. XVIII. 8, 9. 
--><A NAME="p28"></a>
 as instruments of our will. Therefore human acts, although they may be 
described according to their outward object, the "material" part of 
them, are yet specifically good or bad according to the end, the 
"formal" part of them. Aristotle, accordingly, observes (Nic. Eth., v. 
2) that he who steals in order to commit adultery, is even more an 
adulterer than a thief.  <p>

<i>Indifferent acts.</i><p>

A human act, <i>i.e.</i>, a moral act, gets its species from its object 
as related to the (directing) principle of human acts, which is reason. 
Hence, if the object of the act embraces what is in accordance with the 
order of reason, the species of act will be good, <i>e.g.</i>, to give 
alms. But if it include what is repugnant to the order of reason, the 
act will be, specifically, a bad act; <i>e.g.</i>, to take unjustly 
another's property. But the object of the act may possibly embrace 
nothing pertaining to the order of reason, <i>e.g.</i>, to pick up a 
straw from the ground. Such acts are in themselves indifferent. <p>

I say, in themselves; but when we consider the individual who does the 
act the case is altered. For a moral act has goodness not only from its 
object, but also from its circumstances. And every individual act has 
circumstances by which it may be rendered good or bad; the intention 
at least may produce this result. For since it is the part of reason to 
direct, an act proceeding from deliberate reason, if not ordered for
the due end, is, on that very account, repugnant to reason, and is bad; 
but if it is ordained for a due end, it is in accordance with reason, 
and is so far good. <p>

But every act of a man which proceeds from deliberative reason is 
either ordained or not ordained for a due end therefore, considered 
with reference to the individual, it is either good or bad.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> But if it 
does not so proceed, as when 
<!--
Qu. XIX. 1, 2.] INWARD ACTS OF THE WILL. 29  
--><A NAME="p29"></a>
 rubs his beard, or moves his hand or his foot, such an act is not, 
properly speaking, human or moral, and is indifferent.<p>

<i>Does any circumstance constitute a specifically moral act, bad or 
good?</i><p>

I answer yes; because the species of moral acts, as species, depend 
upon the concepts or forms, as framed by the mind. And so what in any 
act is viewed as a supervening circumstance, may again be viewed as one 
of the chief conditions of the object. Thus taking unjustly another's 
property is theft in general; but we may also consider some 
circumstance which adds a special deformity contrary to the order of 
reason, as the place, the time, the person, the manner. And so theft 
may be robbery or sacrilege.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. The good and evil of the inward acts of the will.</h4><p>

A good will depends upon its object. <p>

Good and evil <i>per se</i> pertain to the will, as the true and the 
false pertain to the intellect. But in human acts different objects 
make a difference in kind. Good and evil, therefore, in acts of the 
will depend upon the object of it. It is true that the will can only 
seek the good; but what seems so may be only the apparent good. And so 
the act of will is sometimes evil.  <p>

The goodness of the will depends upon the object alone, not on the 
circumstances of the act. This object is the end sought; we are 
speaking, therefore, of the intended end. <p>

If the will is for the good, no circumstance can make that a bad will. 
If you say that any one wills any good when, or where, or as he ought 
not to do, your words are equivocal. For you may mean that that 
circumstance is willed. And so he does not will the good. Because the 
willing a good when, or where, or as, one ought not so to 
<!--
GOOD AND EVIL IN HUMAN ACTS. [Qu. XIX. 3,4,5. 
--><A NAME="p3"></a>
 do, is not willing the good. But again, you may mean the very act of 
willing; and so it is impossible that any one should will the good 
when he ought not to, because he ought always to will it; unless, 
perhaps, accidentally, when in willing this good, lie is hindered from 
willing some good which be ought to will. And the evil does not arise 
from his willing that good, but from his not willing the other. <p>

It may be objected that ignorance of circumstances excuses the evil of 
the will; and that this proves that the goodness or the evil of the 
will depends upon those circumstances, and not upon its object only. 
But this excuse regards the circumstances as a part of the thing 
willed, <i>i.e.</i>, we are ignorant of the circumstances of the act 
which is willed. Thus the objection falls to the ground.  <p>

<i>The goodness of the will depends upon reason also.</i><p>

For the object of the will is proposed to it by the reason. This is not 
the good of sense or imagination. That is offered to the sensuous 
appetite, not to the will. The object of reason and will is the good as 
viewed in its general conception.  <p>

<i>The goodness of the will depends, still more, upon eternal law.</i><p>

The light of reason which is in us can show us the good, and regulate 
our reason, only so far as it is derived from the eternal light (Ps. 
iv. 6). This shines on us in the form of eternal law. We do not know 
it, indeed, as it exists in God; but our reason is the image of God in 
us, and naturally, or by supernatural revelation, sees in part that 
eternal law which orders our reason itself as the measure of our acts.  <p>

Every will discordant with reason, whether that reason is correct or 
erring, is a bad will. <p>

By conscience I understand the act in which we apply our moral judgment 
(1) testifying concerning what we 
<!--
Qu. XIX. 5.] ERRONEOUS CONSCIENCE. 31
--><A NAME="p31"></a>
 have done or left undone; (2) judging that something is to be done or 
not to be done; (3) judging that what has been done was rightly or not 
rightly done, <i>sc.</i>, an accusing or excusing conscience. So 
understood, the question before us may be otherwise stated, <i>sc., 
does an erroneous conscience create obligation?</i> In things 
indifferent (in their own nature) a will discordant from reason, an 
erroneous conscience, is, in a certain way, bad on account of the 
object on which good or evil in the will depends; not indeed on account 
of the object as it is in itself, but as it is regarded by reason, 
being viewed as good or bad, to be done or to be shunned. And because 
the object of the will is that which is proposed to it by reason, if 
anything is presented by the reason as evil, a will following that is a 
bad will. <p>

But this is true not only of things indifferent, but also of those 
which are in themselves good or bad. For that which is good may be 
viewed as evil, and that which is evil may be regarded as good. To 
abstain from fornication is a moral good. But we do not seek this good 
as a good, except as it is presented by our reason. If, therefore, it 
is presented by an erroneous conscience as evil, we follow that 
abstinence under the idea of its being sin. And the will is bad because 
it wills what we regard as evil. To believe in Christ is <i>per se</i> 
good and necessary to salvation. But if our reason judges that faith to 
be an imposture, we accept it as an evil thing; our will is a bad will. 
Therefore S. Paul says (Rom. XIV. 23), "Whatsoever is not of faith is 
sin." <p>

It may be objected, (1) that reason is the rule of human will because 
it is based on eternal law, but an erring reason is not derived from 
eternal law, and so is not the rule of human will; neither is the will 
bad if it does not agree with an erring reason. But, nevertheless, that 
erring reason proposes its judgment as true and based on God's law. 
(2) Erroneous conscience sometimes proposes what 
<!--
GOOD AND EVIL IN HUMAN ACTS. [Qu. XIX. 6. 
--><A NAME="p6"></a>
 is contrary to the command of God, and therefore imposes no 
obligation. But if any one believes that the order coming from a 
subordinate officer is the command of the chief, in despising the one 
he despises the other. So if we were aware that our reason dictated 
something contrary to God's command, we would not be bound to follow 
that. But, in that case our reason would not be totally erroneous. But 
when erring reason presents anything as a commandment of God, to 
despise that dictate of reason, and to reject the commandment of God, 
are one and the same.  <p>

<i>Is a will which agrees with erring reason a good will?</i><p>

This is the same as the question whether an erroneous conscience 
excuses. It has already been shown (qu. vi., art. 8) that ignorance 
sometimes causes the involuntary, sometimes does not. And since moral 
good and evil imply a voluntary act, it is evident that that ignorance 
which makes action involuntary, totally removes from it the notion of 
good or evil; but not that ignorance which does not cause the 
involuntary. And it has also been shown that ignorance which is 
directly or indirectly willed, does not produce the involuntary; such 
ignorance is directly willed, when it is intentional; it is indirectly 
willed when it results from negligence, from our not willing to know 
that which we are bound to know. If then reason or conscience err 
through directly or indirectly voluntary ignorance, such error being 
with regard to that which we are bound to know, it does not hinder a 
will which agrees with erring reason or conscience from being a bad 
will. <p>

The will of those who slew the apostles was a bad will but they thought 
that their action was one of reason and piety towards God. The Lord 
himself said, "The hour cometh that whosoever killeth you shall think 
that he offereth service unto God" (S. John xvi. 2). <p>

But if the error be that which causes the involuntary, coming from 
ignorance of some Circumstance, in which  
<!--
Qu. XIX. 6, 7.]	ERRONEOUS CONSCIENCE. 33  
--><A NAME="p33"></a>
 there has been no negligence, then such error excuses and the will 
agreeing with erring reason is not a bad will. <p>

But if the will discordant from erring reason is bad, why not the will 
which agrees with it good? I answer, the good requires the full, 
complete conditions indicated already, and defeat in any one is evil. 
The will is bad in following that which is actually evil, or that 
which is deemed such; but that the will be good, both are requisite.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> 
<p>

Eternal law cannot err, but human reason can err; therefore a will 
agreeing with human reason has not always rectitude, nor is it always 
in accordance with eternal law. <p>

This truth produces no perplexity, nor any necessity of sinning. 
Suppose that one does what he is bound to do out of a spirit of 
vainglory. He sins, whether he does it or leaves it undone. But there 
is no perplexity, no need of sinning; be can cast away his bad 
intention. From vincible and voluntary ignorance follows evil in the 
will; but the error can be removed; therefore there is no necessity of 
sinning.  <p>

<i>Does the goodness of the will respecting the means depend upon the 
intention or end aimed at?</i><p>

This intention may be viewed as preceding or as following the act of 
the will which we are now considering. It precedes causally the act of 
the will, when we will something on account of our aiming at a certain 
end. And then this relation to the end is regarded as one reason why 
the thing willed is good. Thus one may will to fast out of a sense of 
obligation towards God; and that fasting is so far good, viz., because 
it is done for God's sake. Since, then, the goodness of the will (as we 
have seen) depends upon the 
<!--
34 GOOD AND EVIL IN HUMAN ACTS. [Qu. XIX. 7. 
--><A NAME="p34"></a>
 goodness of the thing willed, it necessarily depends upon the end 
aimed at.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

But the intention may follow an act of the will, in a certain way, 
<i>e.g.</i>, if one wills to do a certain thing, and afterwards refers 
it to God. Then the goodness of the first act of will does not depend 
upon the subsequent intention, except so far as the act of will is 
repeated along with that subsequent intention. <p>

I anticipate three objections. (1) It has been said that the goodness 
of the will depends upon the object alone; but when we will the means 
to an end, the object willed is different from the end intended. I 
answer that when the intention is the cause of the act of will it is 
the relation to the end which is the reason why we attribute goodness 
to the object directly willed. <p>

(2) Willing to keep the commandments of God pertains to a good will; 
but this may be referred to a bad end, <i>e.g.</i>, vainglory or 
covetousness; as when one wills to obey God on account of some earthly 
benefits which he expects thereby. But the will is not good if a bad 
intention is the cause of its act. He who wills to give alms, because 
he expects to get a good name thereby, wills that which in itself is 
good under the idea of evil. Therefore, so far as willed by him, it is 
evil and his will is a bad will. <p>

(3) The badness of the will does not depend (solely) on the evil end; 
for he who wills to defraud in order that he may be able to give for 
charitable ends, has a bad will, although he aims at a good end. <p>

But it has been already pointed out that the evil results from either 
one of the possible defects; whereas the good  
<!--
Qu. XIX 7, 9, 10.] GOODNESS IN THE HUMAN WILL. 35
--><A NAME="p35"></a>
 requires completeness in its requisites. The will is bad whether it 
seeks what is in itself evil under the notion of good, or what is good 
under the idea that it is evil. But for a good will it is required that 
it seek the good under the notion of good, <i>i.e.</i>, that it will 
the good for the sake of the good.  <p>

<i>The goodness of the human will depends upon its conformity to the 
Divine will.</i><p>

For the goodness of the will depends upon its end, and its ultimate end 
is the highest good, which is God. The object of that infinite will is 
the highest good, and thus that Divine will is the measure of rectitude 
and goodness of will throughout the universe. Our will, indeed, cannot 
be conformed to that by equivalence, but only by imitation. So is it 
also with our knowledge, so far as we are able to know the truth.  <p>

<i>Is it necessary that our will be conformed to the Divine will in the 
very thing willed, in order that we may have a good will?</i> <p>

We have seen that the will is directed to its object as proposed by 
reason. Now since anything may be viewed by reason in different lights, 
in one way it may be good, in another evil. And therefore, if the will 
of one person follow it according as it is good, he has a good will; 
while another, willing the same thing not to exist, because it has evil 
in it, has also a good will. So the judge has a good will when he wills 
the criminal to be executed, because the punishment is just; but the 
will of the wife or child, in willing the opposite, may also be a good 
will, because that execution is a sundering of natural ties. But since 
will follows reason's apprehension of a thing, it follows that that 
good will is of a higher sort, which seeks the higher good which reason 
apprehends. Thus, in the example before us, the judge has a care of the 
higher good, <i>sc.</i>, that of the 
<!--
GOOD AND EVIL IN HUMAN ACTS. [Qu. XIX. 10. 
--><A NAME="p10"></a>
 community, viz., justice. Therefore he wills the execution of the 
criminal as related to the common good. But the wife looks at the good 
of the family, and, for the sake of that, wills that the criminal be 
not executed. But what God specially regards is the good of the 
universe, of which He is Creator and governor. Hence whatever He 
wills falls under the notion of the universal good, His own goodness. 
But our apprehension, according to our nature, is of some particular 
good proportioned to our nature. Now that may be good, so viewed, which 
is not good in more general relations, and conversely. Hence it is that 
diverse wills of different men may be good though directed towards 
opposites, as falling under diverse particular notions. <p>

But there is no rectitude of will in willing some special good, unless 
that be referred to the general good as the end. For from the end is 
derived the reason for willing the means to the end. In one way, then 
(what Aristotle calls the "material" part), a right will seeks the 
particular good; but (in the "formal" part), in the ultimate 
intention, that right will seeks the common good which is Divine. <p>

Our human will, therefore, is bound to be conformed to the Divine will 
in its ultimate intention, <i>i.e.</i>, to will under the same notion 
with the Divine will, to will because God wills (saying "not my will, 
but Thine be done "). But it is not necessarily so obliged in the 
special thing which is willed (the material part of the act, respecting 
which we do not know the Divine will). But even in both in a certain 
way the right human will is conformed to the Divine will. For in being 
conformed to that in the general notion of the thing willed, it is so 
conformed in the ultimate end; while, if not conformed in the special 
thing which is willed, it nevertheless is so in the idea of the 
efficient cause, since the special inclination to the special good is 
derived from God its maker. Hence we may say that our human will is  
<!--
Qu. XX. 2] OUTWARD HUMAN ACTS. 37 
--><A NAME="p37"></a>
 conformed to the Divine will when we will that which God wills that we 
should will. <p>

From the grace of charity man wills what God wills, and as God wills 
it. And this is the being conformed to the Divine will, since the 
ultimate end is the object of charity. <p>

(1) No objection then can be found in the fact that we are often 
ignorant in particulars of what God wills, while we are unable to will 
what we are ignorant of. For in those particulars we are not obliged to 
conform our will to the Divine will. But we do know what kind of thing 
is willed by God. For we know that whatever God wills, He wills under 
the idea of the good. And therefore, whenever we will a thing as good, 
we have a will conformed to God's will in that general notion. <p>

(2) But how can man will the damnation of him who dies in mortal sin? 
Yet God wills this. I answer that it is not as death or as damnation 
that God wills such a thing, for He wills that all men be saved. But He 
wills death and condemnation under the idea of justice. Therefore it is 
enough for man to will that the order of justice and the order of 
nature be preserved. <p>

There is no repugnance of wills when diverse things are willed from 
different points of view. True repugnance is found only where the thing 
is viewed under the same notion.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. On good and evil in outward human acts.</h4><p>

<i>Does all the good or evil of outward acts solely depend on the moral 
character of the will?</i><p>

I answer that we may consider either the due matter and circumstances, 
or the relation to the end. The latter depends solely on the will. But 
the former depends on reason, and on this depends the goodness of the 
will. Remember that any one of the defects already pointed out 
(p. 26-7) makes anything evil; but that anything be good, 
<!--
38 GOOD AND EVIL IN HUMAN ACTS. [Qu. XX. 4, 5.  
--><A NAME="p38"></a>
 simply, one requisite does not suffice, but complete integrity is 
requisite. If therefore the will be good, both as regards its proper 
object and the end sought for, the outward act will be good; but it is 
not sufficient that the aim be good. But if the will be bad, either in 
the intention or in the act willed, the outward act will be evil.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> 
Both are sins of the will. (Where there is no will, there is no sin.)  <p>

<i>Does the outward act add an thing to the good or evil of the inward 
act?</i><p>

If we speak of the good or evil derived from the end sought for, then 
the outward act adds nothing in that respect, unless it happen that the 
will in itself is rendered better by good deeds or worse by evil deeds. 
This may happen (1) by repeated acts of will; (2) by prolonged inward 
action; (3) by the increased intensity of will which pleasurable acts 
produce, while painful acts have the opposite effect. And the more 
intense the will is in tending to good or evil, the better or the worse 
it is. <p>

But if we speak of the goodness or the badness which the outward act 
has according to due matter and circumstances, since that outward act 
is the terminus and end of the will, it adds to the goodness or the 
badness of the will. For every such motion reaches its perfection at 
its terminus. Will is only perfect when it operates, if the opportunity 
of doing so is afforded to it. But if there is no possibility of 
action, and the perfect will is present, it would act if it could. The 
outward defect is simply involuntary. This involuntary state of things 
adds nothing to the merit or demerit, and takes nothing away.  <p>

<i>Do consequences add anything to the goodness or the badness of 
outward acts?</i><p>

The event which follows action is either contemplated 
<!--
Qu. XXI. 1.] RESULTS OF MORAL ACTS. 39 
--><A NAME="p39"></a>
 beforehand, or it is not. If it is so intended, it manifestly adds to 
the goodness or the badness of the act. For when one foresees that from 
his act many ill consequences may arise, and yet does not on that 
account refrain from action, his will is evidently the more inordinate 
on this account. But if the result which follows was not contemplated 
in advance, then a distinction is to be made; because if, <i>per 
se</i>, and ordinarily, this result is wont to happen in consequence of 
such an act, then the resulting event does add to the goodness or the 
badness of the act. For it is manifest that that is a better act in its 
kind from which many good results may flow; and that is a worse act 
from which naturally flow many evil consequences.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

But if we speak of an accidental result, which follows only in 
exceptional cases, then such an event adds nothing to the moral status 
of the act. <p>

Note that acts may be similar in their nature, but very different from 
a moral point of view.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. What results from the moral character of human acts?</h4><p>

Human acts as good or bad fall under the notion of rectitude or of sin. <p>

The word "bad," used in its widest extent, is of broader signification 
than "sin," as "good" is of wider extent than "righteous." For every 
privation of good in anything whatsoever, is bad. But sin, fault, is 
found only in the act  
<!--
40  GOOD AND EVIL IN HUMAN ACTS. [Qu. XXI. 2. 
--><A NAME="p40"></a>
 which is produced for a certain end, when that act has not due 
relation to that end. <p>

But that due order with respect to the end is measured according to 
some rule. In natural agents this rule is the natural inclination to 
the end; and rectitude of action, the absence of fault, consists in 
undeviating following of that rule. But in those things which proceed 
from will, the proximate rule is reason; the supreme rule is eternal 
law. Whensoever, then, man's act proceeds toward the end according to 
the order of reason and eternal law, the act is right; but when it 
deviates from this rectitude, it is sinful. Hence it follows that in 
human conduct the good and the bad are the righteous or the sinful.  <p>

<i>Human acts, as good or bad, are laudable or culpable.</i><p>

An act is called laudable or culpable when it is imputed to the agent. 
But it is so imputed, when it is in his power, so that he has dominion 
over his action. But this is true of all voluntary acts, because by 
will we have such dominion. And only voluntary acts are laudable or 
culpable. <p>

(1) It is true that fault exists in what is produced by nature, which 
is neither laudable nor culpable. But such acts are not in the power of 
the natural agent, since nature is determined to a single result. 
Therefore the idea of blame has no place in this matter. <p>

(2) There is fault, not always blame, in what is done by man's art. But 
the question is a different one from that of morals. There are two 
kinds of fault in connection with art. The artificer may deviate from 
the particular end aimed at by his art; intending to make a good work, 
he may make a had one. This will be fault in his art with its 
particular end. But, also, this particular end is ordained for the 
common end of human life; and in this way there may be fault and sin 
in the artificer if he intend fraudulently to make a bad piece of work, 
and actually does so. 
<!--
Qu. XXI. 3.] RESULTS OF MORAL ACTS. 41 
--><A NAME="p41"></a>
 But this is the fault of the man rather than of the artificer as such. 
In the first case he is blamed as an artificer, hut in the second, as 
a man. But in morals, where the order of reason is regarded with 
reference to the common end of life, fault is always a deviation from 
the order of reason respecting the common end of human life. For such 
fault a man is blamed as a man and a moral agent. <p>

(3) Infirmity or weakness may take away or diminish the blame. And 
evil, as such, is weak, impotent. But the infirmity which is found in 
voluntary evil is subject to man's power; and, therefore, it neither 
takes away nor diminishes the blameworthiness.  <p>

Human acts as good or evil have merit or demerit according to 
retributive justice (between man and man). <p>

The prophet says (Is. iii. 10), " Say ye to the righteous, that it 
shall be well with him : for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. 
Woe unto the wicked: it shall be ill with him : for the reward of his 
hands shall be given him." Merit and demerit express the relation of 
human acts to retribution according to justice. But this retribution is 
due to any one according as he injures or benefits another. But each 
one living in any society is a part and member of that society. In 
doing good or evil to another member his act affects the whole society, 
as he who cuts off a hand injures the man. In benefiting or injuring 
another, there is a two-fold merit or demerit; one, as retribution is 
due from the individual who is aided or injured; another, as 
retribution is due from the society. But when any one ordains his act 
primarily for the society, retribution is due to him primarily and 
principally from the society, but secondarily from all members of the 
society. And even when any one acts for his own proper good or harm 
retribution is due to him, inasmuch as his action affects the whole 
society, of which he is a part. <p>

(1) It may be asked, how is this 
reconcilable with the 
<!--
42 GOOD AND EVIL IN HUMAN ACTS. [Qu. XXI. 4. 
--><A NAME="p42"></a>
 dominion which man has of his own acts? For no one is blamed for 
disposing as he will of that in which he is absolute lord. If he 
destroy his own property, he does not deserve to be punished as if he 
were destroying another's. I answer, that man himself belongs to the 
community of which he is a part; before that community, therefore, he 
has merit or demerit according as he orders his acts well or ill. So, 
also, if he dispose of his property well or ill, with which he is 
bound to serve the community. <p>

(2) It is true that "virtue is its own reward" and evil is its own 
punishment. But the good or ill which one does to himself affects also 
the community (and calls for retribution from it).  <p>

<i>Are human acts, as good or bad, meritorious or demeritorious before 
God?</i> <p>

The Holy Word says (Eccl. xii. 14), "God shall bring every work into 
judgment, whether it be good or whether it be evil." We have just seen 
that acts have merit or demerit as they are ordained with reference to 
another, either for his own sake, or for that of the community. In both 
modes our acts, good and bad, have merit or demerit before God; by 
reason of Himself, because he is the ultimate end of man to which all 
acts must be referred; but by reason also of the universal community of 
which He is Governor and Lord. For he who rules has the care of the 
common good, and it therefore pertains to him to reward and punish what 
is done well or ill in that community. If there were no such merit and 
demerit, God would have no care of human acts. <p>

(1) It is easy to object that our acts can do no harm, confer no 
benefit, upon God. But man can withdraw something from God or render it 
to him, by observing or not observing the due order which God has 
instituted. <p>

(2) Again, it may be objected that man is only an instrument of Divine 
ordering; and an instrument has no merit
<!--
Qu. XXI. 4.] MORAL CHARACTER OF HUMAN ACTS. 43 
--><A NAME="p43"></a>
 or demerit with him who uses it. Isaiah said (x. 15), "Shall the axe 
boast itself against him that heweth therewith?" I reply that man is 
so moved as an instrument of God that he also moves himself with free 
Choice of his action. <p>

Again, it may be objected that human acts obtain merit or demerit from 
their being ordered with reference to another. But not every act is 
ordered with reference to God; therefore not all have this merit or 
demerit. I answer that not the whole man, with all that he has, is 
ordained to be referred to the political community. And therefore not 
every act of his has merit or demerit before that community. But the 
whole man, and all that he has, is ordained for God. Therefore every 
act of his is the occasion for reward or punishment.  <p>

(S. Thomas explains further this notion of merit in qu. cxiv. art. 1. 
It means a reward, not from absolute justice, which herein is out of 
the question, but according to conditions of reward pre-ordained by God 
Himself, and fulfilled with the aid of His prevenient and sustaining 
grace. In the strict sense of merit, Tennyson's words are unchallenged  
"Merit lives from man to man, And not from man, O God, to Thee.")<p>

<a name="n_5"><a href="#n5">{5}</a></a> The ill effects of our act are imputed to us, even though that act 
be imperfectly voluntary, on three conditions, so., (a) if those 
effects are in some degree foreseen even <i>in confuso</i>; (b) if the 
cause of them could be avoided (c) and if by reason of those ill 
effects we are bound not to do what produces them otherwise we may 
merely permit the ill effects and not be answerable for them. <p>

The good end sought for by us may justify our action even though some 
ill effects follow from it, <i>if</i> (1) that end is good (2) if the 
action is itself good, or, at least, indifferent; and (3) if the good 
effect which we expect is at least as near to the end as that bad 
effect and equal to it. <p>
