<h3>CHAPTER VII.  THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Sacraments in general</h4><p>

Since the doctrine of sacraments in general as well as of the 
sacraments individually belongs to Dogmatic Theology, only so much of 
it need here be indicated as is necessarily assumed in Moral Theology. <p>

A sacrament is defined with theological precision in the catechism of 
the Anglican Church. It is (1) "an outward and visible sign of an 
inward and spiritual grace given to us, (2) ordained by Christ himself, 
(3) as a means whereby we receive the same and a pledge to assure us 
thereof." This definition is substantially one with that of other parts 
of the Catholic Church -- <i>e.g.</i>, the catechism of Trent; 
<i>sc.</i>, "a visible sign of an inward grace, instituted for oar 
justification." In a wider sense the word has been employed in the 
Church for any sign of a sacred thing, as the Pasehal Lamb in the old 
covenant, <i>"sacrae rei signum"</i> (S. Aug.) or for a hidden mystery 
outwardly signified, <i>"sacrum secretum;"</i> or for an oath as a 
sacred thing. <p>

A sacrament is (1) commemorative of the Passion of Christ; (2) 
demonstrative of present grace conferred; (3) prognostic of future 
glory (Summ. Theol. III. lx. 3).  <p>

<i>Requisites</i>. It follows that three things are required to 
constitute a valid sacrament (1) "An outward and visible sign" for the 
eye, some material thing or action; (2) a form of words, a sign for the 
ear; (3) a person authorized to administer the sacrament, because it 
has been ordained by God as a means of sanctification, and He, through 
His agent, is the only one who can confer what is signified. 
<!--
558 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS.  
--><A NAME="p558"></a><p>

The first two requisites are based upon the nature of man (III. lx. 4). 
Divine wisdom provides for each thing according to its nature and 
limits; "to each according to his several ability" (S. Matt. xxv. 15). 
But it is natural to man to arrive at spiritual realities through 
sensible things and a sign is that by which one communicates with 
another. Hence, since the holy realities which are signified by 
sacraments are spiritual blessings by which man is sanctified, they are 
outwardly expressed by sensible things, just as God speaks to man in 
the Holy Scriptures in a similar manner. <p>

Considered in themselves, sensible things do not pertain to the kingdom 
of God (S. John iv. 24; Rom. xiv. 17), but only as they are signs of 
those spiritual realities which belong to that kingdom.  <p>

(1) The material thing employed in the sacrament must be substantially 
that, according to the judgment and custom of men, which was 
determined by Christ for that purpose. For example, the Holy Eucharist 
requires bread and wine; nothing else can take their place; and the 
bread must be that, leavened or unleavened, which was so named and used 
at the time when our Lord instituted the Holy Eucharist; the wine also 
must be what was known and used as wine. Any substantial change in this 
regard nullifies the religious act as sacrament. There is no sacrament. 
Thus some other article of food might be taken; or currant juice, or 
some other drink; but, even if ignorantly done, it would be a profane 
and idle imitation of a sacrament and destitute of inward grace.  <p>

(2) The form of words (<i>"accedit verbum ad elementum, et fit 
sacramentum,"</i> S. Aug., Super Joan., 80) is grounded (a) on the 
nature of the Incarnate Word who took sensible flesh; (b) on the 
nature of man, since "faith comes by hearing;" (c) on the perfection 
of the sacrament itself, which is more fully expressed by spoken words 
than by 
<!--
SACRAMENTS IN GENERAL. 559 
--><A NAME="p559"></a>
 visible signs. Thus the pouring of water may signify either ablution 
or cooling; but the words, "I baptize thee," manifest that the water 
is used to signify a spiritual cleansing. <p>

The words employed are an inward thought outwardly spoken in whatever 
language is used among men. Thus the Greek Catholic will say in his 
language, "The servant of God, N., is baptized," etc., and the form for 
lay baptism given in the constitutions of Archbishop Peckham (1279) is 
"I <i>crysten</i> thee in the Name of the Fader, and of the Son, and of 
the Holy Goste." But the essential form and meaning are preserved. But 
this being understood, it must be also remembered that Christ, not man, 
is the author of sacraments, and that the determinate words and matter 
which are of Divine appointment are essential to the existence of a 
sacrament. <p>

Hence it follows (a) that if either matter or form be essentially 
defective, there is no sacrament, and the priest must act accordingly, 
ignoring the so-called sacrament. <p>

(b) There may he corrupt intention perverting the words; <i>e.g.</i>, 
heretical denial of the faith may lead to a pretended baptism "in the 
name of God" or "of Christ," etc. There is no intention to do what 
Christ and the Church have appointed; there is no sacrament. Or a man 
at his table may say, "Let us eat and drink in memory of our Saviour;" 
or in a public assembly, under the influence of the so-called 
"temperance" movement, grape or currant juice may be distributed. Again 
there is absence of the requisite intention; there is no sacrament. <p>

(c) Through inadvertence there may be <i>"lapsus linguae."</i> If more 
or less voluntary it will be a graver or lighter sin but the essential 
question will be whether the sense of the words has been materially 
affected or not. In the one case, there is no sacrament; in the other, 
the error does not affect it. <p>

(d) A deaf mute cannot act as priest in the most essential 
<!--
560 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p560"></a>
 parts of the priestly office. It is impossible to divide a sacrament 
so that one person should do the visible part and another use the 
requisite words.  <p>

Repetition in case of doubt. Sacraments were made for man, and should 
be repeated if there be prudent doubt of their validity. Charity, 
justice, religion demand this. <p>

If there be no such grave doubt, it is sin to repeat them. But 
reverence for the sacrament requires that the repetition be made 
conditionally, either mentally or in spoken words. (See the rubric at 
the end of the Office for Private Baptism.) The words, "If thou art not 
already baptized," etc., are then audibly uttered, lest persons present 
may think that baptism can be repeated. <p>

What has just been said applies especially to those necessary rites of 
the Church of God which can be celebrated only once, viz., Baptism and 
Holy Orders; in those the doubt need not be so great as in other cases 
in order that conditional repetition be justified. <p>

But a merely light apprehension that the essential words have not been 
used will not justify repetition; it is to be taken for granted that 
all has been duly said and done.  <p>

The minister of the sacrament contributes nothing to it by his fitness 
or holiness, although he, like any other, may add his private prayer 
for special benediction upon it. The minister, the matter, the words, 
are one in this respect. God alone works the inward effect of the 
sacrament, for He alone can reach the soul. Grace is spiritual, and 
from God only. The "character" which is given by some sacraments as a 
"sealing" of the soul, can only come from Him who uses material agents 
instrumentally for His supernatural work. <p>

The prayers which are used in conferring the sacraments are offered to 
God, not on the part of any individual, but from the Church, whose 
prayers are acceptable with God 
<!--
SACRAMENTS IN GENERAL. 561 
--><A NAME="p561"></a>
 (S. Matt. xviii. 19). Any devout person may ask and be heard also. But 
the effect of the Sacrament is not from any grayer but from the merits 
of the Passion of Christ, whose power operates in and through His 
appointed means. The effect is not more because of a worthier 
ministrant, although the prayer may gain an added blessing.<p>

The celebration of sacraments has rites and prayers added by the 
Church, like the consecration of the water for Holy Baptism; not that 
they are essential, but for greater solemnity and decency, and to 
excite greater devotion and reverence in those who receive the 
sacraments. <p>

The Church cannot add to the sacraments, for "they are ordained by 
Christ Himself" (III. lxiv. 1, 2). <p>

It follows from this that the sacraments can be validly administered 
by those who are in mortal sin, although for themselves they add new 
sin to their load of guilt by celebrating in such a state. The 
instrument acts only through the power of Him who uses it. So the 
physician who uses the art of his mind in healing others may himself be 
diseased in body; and the pipe through which water flows may be of 
silver or of lead.  <p>

The unbelief of the minister is parallel with any other sin of his. 
Whether he utterly lack faith or charity, he is still the instrument 
used by the power of Christ. He may utterly disbelieve that any effect 
will follow from what he does, but he is not ignorant that the Church 
for which he acts has faith, and that her faith is expressed in the 
commission which he has received from her. He acts as her agent, and 
her faith supplies the lack of his. <p>

(1) But can one give what he does not possess? Can the unclean cleanse 
the impure? It is not the ministers of the Church who give or cleanse. 
That is done only by Christ through them by His own power (1 Cor. iii. 
5). <p>

(2) But is he not cut off from Christ, since only those who "dwell 
in love dwell in God"? Yes; but the instru<!--
562 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS.  
 --><A NAME="p562"></a>ment may be a dead one and cut off from any union with Him who 
employs it, and yet he may do all that He wills by it. <p>

(3) What is lacking is not what is essential to the sacrament, but what 
is fitting for decency and reverence (III. lxiv. 5). (Lev. xxi. 17; 
see also the 26th Article of Religion.) <p>

It follows, also, that there is no sin in receiving from such an 
unworthy minister of sacraments. For it is not the individual as such 
who is resorted to, but the minister of the Church; and, therefore, as 
long as he is tolerated by the Church in his ministry, he who receives 
a sacrament at his hands does not cooperate in the sin, but 
communicates with the Church which uses such ministry. But if the 
unworthy minister be suspended or degraded, then he who receives a 
sacrament from him does cooperate in the sin. <p>

It has been said that those who are in a state of sin are guilty in 
administering the sacraments in such a state, since they are profaning 
most holy things. But there is no need of perplexity in this truth, as 
if the same person would sin also in refusing to celebrate the 
sacrament when it is his duty so to do; for he can repent of his sin. 
And if he will not repent he ought to be perplexed, for he sins in 
refusing or in not refusing to celebrate what he was ordained to 
perform. But in case of necessity he would not he sinning in baptizing 
one who could find no other minister, for even a layman would be 
justified in celebrating the sacrament in such a case. <p>

So with regard to open and avowed heretics, cut off from the body of 
Christ. They may, and often do, neglect the essentials of a valid 
sacrament, giving neither it nor its grace. But they may fully observe 
the requisite form, and then their sacrament is valid and cannot be 
repeated, although the inward grace may be suspended in the recipient 
until he has found his place in the Lord's body. It is, of course, sin 
to receive the sacraments from such persons, 
<!--
SACRAMENTS IN GENERAL. 563 
--><A NAME="p563"></a>
 and no inward grace can be expected therefrom, unless, perhaps, 
ignorance is an excuse. <p>

It should be understood, also, that the power of conferring sacraments 
pertains to that indelible "character" which is further explained on 
page 566; and one who is suspended or degraded from his office does not 
lose this power, but he is deprived of the right to exercise it 
lawfully. He confers the sacrament, but sins in doing so; and he who 
receives it from him sins also, and fails of the inward part, unless 
ignorance excuse him (III. lxiv. 9).  <p>

<i>What shall we say of mock sacraments?</i> The Roman doctrine of 
<i>intention</i> presents serious difficulties, while the Anglican 
Church seems to have said nothing upon the subject. It is evident, 
however, that the sacramental action may have more than one meaning; it 
may be done either seriously or in jest. It could hardly be pretended 
that a profane mockery of Holy Baptism or Holy Eucharist was a valid 
sacrament because all outward requisites were present. There is 
presumed, at least, a serious intention of doing what Christ commanded 
and what the Church does. <p>

But there is patent objection to a sweeping doctrine that true 
intention is always requisite -- <i>sc.</i>, how can any one know 
another's intention? If, therefore, the intention of the minister be 
requisite for the perfection of the sacrament, a man can never be sure 
that he has received it, and must lack the assurance of salvation which 
it was intended to bestow. S. Thomas Aquinas's words are so moderate 
and judicious that they seem to be worth quoting in full (III. lxiv. 
8): "Some say that the defect of mental intention in the minister is 
supplied in the case of children by Christ who inwardly baptizes; and 
in adults who devoutly seek the sacrament by their faith and devotion. 
And this might be well said as regards the ultimate effect, which is 
justification from sins. But as regards the 'character' which some 
sacraments imprint on the soul, it does not seem that de<!--
564 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS.  
 --><A NAME="p564"></a>vout faith can supply what is wanting in this case, for that is 
never imprinted except by a perfect sacrament. Therefore, others better 
say that the minister of the sacrament acts in the person of the whole 
Church, and in the words which he utters is expressed the intention of 
the Church, which suffices for the perfection of the sacrament, unless 
the contrary is outwardly indicated by the minister or the recipient." <p>

"Perverse intention perverts the man's work, not another's. And, 
therefore, from the perverse intention of the minister is perverted 
what he does as man, not what Christ does; just as if some one with 
corrupt intention should carry alms to the poor, which his master had 
sent with kind intention." (The alms would be equally beneficial 
whatever the intention might be.) <p>

Of course, this matter of intention should not be misunderstood; 
whatever view is taken of it, it does not apply to such cases of 
distraction as are liable to occur when one does not observe what he is 
doing while using the most solemn words and actions. In such a case the 
habitual intention of the soul is what counts, although there may be 
grievous sin in the negligent inattention.  <p>

<i>The minister's obligation</i> is to give the sacraments cheerfully 
and without pay. But he must deny them to the unworthy (S. Matt. vii. 
6). This means, (1) that to the secret sinner privately asking, the 
sacraments must be denied. <p>

(2) That to the open and notorious sinner privately or publicly 
applying, they must be refused (see the rubric before the Order for 
Holy Eucharist). <p>

(3) That the secret sinner publicly presenting himself must not be 
rejected. Scandal, disturbance, and aversion on the part of others are 
grave public evils which must be avoided, and the priest is not a 
partaker of another's sin if he so avoid them. 
<!--
SACRAMENTS IN GENERAL. 565  
--><A NAME="p565"></a><p>

<i>Requisites in the subject of the sacraments</i>. The recipient 
contributes nothing but his preparation for the supernatural work. He 
can only supply what is required of him as conditions for receiving the 
grace. <p>

But distinguish what is required of him for a valid sacrament, from 
what is requisite for the inward part of it, the <i>"res 
sacramenti."</i> <p>

The first does not require faith on his part; for if, unbelieving and 
in a state of sin, he should receive the sacrament, still it cannot be 
repeated, if it be a sacrament conferred once for all. Its effect is 
suspended until the spiritual obstacle is removed. <p>

Again, in infants, of course, no preparation or intention is required. 
But in adults intention to receive is requisite for a valid sacrament, 
for none can be unwillingly baptized. <p>

Other sacraments require that one shall have been previously baptized, 
for they are ordinances "of' the living," sacraments for the Church. <p>

A "sacrament of the dead " -- <i>i.e.</i>, of one uncleansed from his 
sin -- requires acts of faith, hope, and penitence. And the minister is 
bound, so far as lies in his power, to see that such spiritual acts are 
elicited from the candidate for spiritual blessing. <p>

For the "sacraments of the living," still more is requisite. He that 
comes must be in a state of grace; for they are ordained for its 
augmentation, and they presuppose it. It is an added sin to receive the 
Holy Eucharist in mortal sin. (See the shorter exhortation to those 
proposing to receive.) "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily is 
guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord."  <p>

Why are sacraments necessary to salvation? (1) From the condition of 
human nature, which is led to spiritual things through corporeal and 
sensible things; (2) from the present state of man, who by sinning has 
subjected his affections to sensible things, and it was fitting that 
God 
<!--
566 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p566"></a>
 should apply His remedies to the disease which makes man incapable of 
purely spiritual things; (3) from the character of man's pursuits and 
actions, which are chiefly engaged in corporeal things. Sacraments are 
ordained in tender mercy to him who would find it too hard to abstract 
himself entirely from the earthly, while also he must be withdrawn from 
superstitious use of material things and actions. <p>

The grace of God is, indeed, sufficient for all; but God gives man 
that grace in a manner fitted to His creature, <p>

The Cross of Christ is the sufficient cause of our redemption, but 
sacraments get their power from that, and apply that to the soul. "All 
we who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death" 
(Rom. vi. 3). <p>

The Passion of Christ has made the sacraments instrumental causes of 
grace; <i>i.e.</i>, God bestows His gift through them. The instrument is 
nothing but a material channel for the virtue of the Divine agent (Tit. 
iii. 5). <p>

This being assumed from Dogmatic Theology, now notice that there are 
some rites of the Church which cannot be repeated, because they stamp 
permanently on the soul what we have called a "character," like a seal 
on wax. Indeed "sealing" is the very word employed in Holy Scripture (2 
Cor. i. 21). Such rites are Holy Baptism, Confirmation, Holy Orders. 
Some spiritual power is received for self or for others, either way for 
God. Thus the baptized are made a "spiritual priesthood," participators 
in the eternal priesthood of the First-born among many brethren, 
offering up spiritual sacrifices acceptable with God through Him (III. 
lxiii.). <p>

Such character or seal is indelible because it gives a share in the 
everlasting priesthood of Christ (Ps. cx. 4). The mutable soul of man 
may lose its grace through his own free will; but the character does 
not depend on man, but on Him who consecrates His people. <p>

But what has been said applies only to the Christian rites which have 
been specified; not, for example, to the 
<!--
HOLY BAPTISM. 567 
--><A NAME="p567"></a>
 Holy Eucharist, for it is the completion and consummation of the 
Christian life in union with Christ; therefore it does not confer this 
sealing which is for a further end. Holy Eucharist can be many times 
repeated.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Holy Baptism.</h4><p>

We must again assume from Dogmatic Theology what is necessary in 
determining the law of God. The outward and sensible part of the 
sacrament of Holy Baptism (the matter and the words) is clearly 
expressed in the catechism of the Anglican Church. It is (1) "water 
wherein the person is baptized (2) in the name of the Father, and of 
the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." The sacrament is an ablution, the 
"washing of regeneration " (Tit. iii. 5). There is no sacrament in the 
water as such; its consecration for its sacred use is a very expressive 
rite, but not an essential one. Compare in this regard the great 
sacrament of the Holy Eucharist. The sacrament consists in the 
application of the water to the human body after the manner of an 
ablution; it is water "wherein the person is baptized." <p>

The word which completes the sacrament is applied to the person 
receiving it; "I baptize thee," or the "servant of God, N., is 
baptized." And observe once more that in the other chief sacrament the 
word, the form of sacramental words, is applied to the elements, not to 
the recipient. <p>

The inward part is man's justification and illumination -- "a death 
unto sin and a new birth unto righteousness; . . . by this sacrament we 
are made children of grace." "In baptism I was made a member of Christ, 
a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven." <p>

In this washing of regeneration is applied to the soul a sealing 
consummated in Confirmation, an indelible charactor which marks it 
forever, whether in glory or in everlasting loss.  <p>

From these dogmatic truths follow --<p>

(1) Nothing else can replace the element of water; that 
<!--
568 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p568"></a>
 is Divinely appointed and no man can make a substitute. "Except a man 
be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of 
God" (S. John iii. 5). <p>

(2) The benediction or consecration of the water, though not essential 
to the sacrament, is not needlessly to be omitted, for it is added as a 
becoming rite for greater solemnity and to excite devotion. The rubric 
does not expressly require it in case of private baptism; but it is 
indirectly suggested "if time and present exigence will suffer." <p>

(3) Since the form of words contains two essential parts -- <i>sc.</i>, 
(a) the indicating of the sacramental act which declares the intention 
of the Church and distinguishes the act from other ablutions, and (b) 
the naming of Him who inwardly baptizes, according to the commandment 
given to the Church (S. Matt. xxviii. 19) -- baptism "in the name of 
God," or "in the name of Christ," or any other such formula of heresy, 
is invalid. Such pretended baptism must be entirely ignored.  <p>

<i>Immersion</i>. It has been said above that the outward part of the 
sacrament is a corporeal ablution sighifying the inward ablation of 
sins. Christ "cleansed" the Church by the washing of water with the 
word" (Eph. v. 26). And this corporeal ablution may be by immersion of 
the whole body or of the head. This adds a new signification, not 
indeed essential to the outward rite, but very expressive of its inward 
part, the "burying with Christ in baptism." <p>

Since the head is the principal member of the body and the chief seat 
of the soul, it, if not the whole body, is immersed, or water is poured 
on it. Such immersion was the usage of the primitive Church, as we 
find, for example, clearly indicated in S. Chrysostom's 24th Homily on 
S. John "We burying our heads in water as in a sepulchre, the old man 
is buried; submerged, it is hidden there, and again arises in the new 
life." <p>

It is certainly wise to follow the more general usage of 
<!--
HOLY BAPTISM. 569 
--><A NAME="p569"></a>
 the Catholic Church through eighteen centuries, although the 
prevailing custom has usually the warrant of necessity or charity -- 
necessity in the case of the feeble and sick, who would otherwise die 
unbaptized or be put to the greatest risks; and it hardly need be said 
that sacramental obligations do not override the laws of natural right. <p>

It is no less open to remark that three thousand persons cannot 
rationally be supposed to have been immersed in or near Jerusalem in 
one day (Acts ii. 41). <p>

Charity may no less imperatively demand the alternative pouring 
(sprinkling, though valid, being illegal in the Anglican Church). The 
usual scruples of parents in the case of infants, the absence of 
sufficiency of the element, the severity of a northern climate 
rendering baptism in outdoor waters a risk of life, the feebleness of 
the recipient even when the baptism is not clinic -- all these and the 
like render needless any scruples respecting deviation from the 
prevalent rule of the Church in favour of the exceptional mode, which 
also has the sanction of every age of the Church. <p>

The priest, of course, is bound to be sure that the water flows upon 
the head; for without this there is no significant washing. And 
indifferent or unbelieving carelessness in this regard is the ground 
for conditional baptism in the case of converts from religious sects 
more or less heretical with respect to sacraments.  <p>

<i>Trine immersion or pouring</i>. Either one or three ablutions is 
valid; the former signifying the unity of the Name, the latter the 
three Divine persons named. The laws of the Church in this regard have 
varied at different periods but our own ancient and still unrepealed 
rule points to the trine immersion or pouring. See also the 50th 
Apostolical Canon "If any bishop or presbyter does not perform the one 
initiation with three immersions, but with giving one immersion only, 
into the death of the Lord, let him be deposed. For the Lord said not, 
Baptize into My death [it is 
<!--
570 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p570"></a>
 subordinate in signification], but, 'Baptize all nations in the name 
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.'  <p>

<i>Why cannot baptism be repeated when a convert is received into the 
outward communion of the Church?</i> (1) Since it is the spiritual new 
birth, it can be had only once (S. John iii. 5; Heb. vi. 4). (2) We 
are baptized into Christ's death, and rise with Him into a new life; 
this can only once be done. (3) An indelible character is given.  <p>

<i>The minister of Holy Baptism</i>. The priest receives in his 
ordination authority to "dispense the word of God and His holy 
sacraments." This gives validity to his official acts; but he must also 
have jurisdiction in each particular application of his authority in 
order that it may be lawful. See Canons of the American Church, title 
i. 12, &sect; 6 "No minister . . . shall officiate either by preaching, 
reading prayers, or otherwise, in the parish, or within the parochial 
cure, of another clergyman, unless he have received express permission 
for that purpose," etc. (Qu.: Parishioners leaving their parish for the 
official services of another priest? Has that other priest jurisdiction 
in such a case?) <p>

As the title of the office of deacon indicates, it is not part of his 
official work to baptize. As a work of charity, in case the official 
minister of the sacrament is not accessible, he may baptize infants. So 
may a layman, but the deacon more fully represents the authority of the 
Church from which the sacramental commission proceeds, and may 
celebrate a solemn public baptism, which the layman may not do. <p>

What the priest's conscience ought to tell him the Church has been 
careful to enforce so far as in her lies. See the unrepealed canons of 
1603, Nos. 68 and 69 "No minister shall refuse or delay to christen any 
child . . .
<!--
HOLY BAPTISM. 571 
--><A NAME="p571"></a>
 that is brought to him upon Sundays or holy-days to be christened, . . 
. convenient warning having been given him thereof before. . . . If he 
shall refuse to christen he shall be suspended by the bishop of the 
diocese from his ministry by the space of three months." <p>

"If any minister, being duly, without any manner of collusion [false 
pretexts for not bringing a child to church], informed of the weakness 
and danger of death of any infant unbaptized in his parish, and 
thereupon desired to go up or come to the place where the said infant 
remaineth, to baptize the same, shall either wilfully refuse so to do 
or of purpose, or of gross negligence shall so defer the time that it 
dieth through such his default, unbaptized: the said minister shall be 
suspended for three months; and before his restitution shall 
acknowledge his fault, and promiso before his ordinary that he will not 
wittingly incur the like again."  <p>

<i>Lay baptism</i>. Unrepealed canons provide for this in case of 
pressing need; although the first rubric on the subject in the Order 
for Private Baptism names a "lawful minister." But, in the inquiries to 
be made respecting the child supposed to be baptized, the matter and 
the words are all that are named as essentials to baptism. <p>

God has ordained for this sacrament the most universal element, 
essential to man's life, so that it is the rarest thing in his 
experience to be where water cannot be had. And so this sacrament, 
"generally necessary to salvation," can rarely be desired when it may 
not be had. In case of pressing need, then, any man, or, in his 
absence, any woman, should do this work of charity. It would be grave 
sin, however, for the layman to take the priest's official duty upon 
himself when God's ordained minister can be had for be would be 
offending against the reverence due to so great a solemnity. <p>

It follows from this that baptism by heretics, by any out
<!--
572 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p572"></a>
 side of the Church's communion, is valid, if matter and words be duly 
employed. Provision is made for conditional baptism if there be prudent 
doubt concerning this; but the Church makes no question concerning the 
person who administered the sacrament. <p>

(1) But how can an unbaptized man give what be does not possess? I 
answer that the minister of the sacrament supplies only the outward 
part; it is Christ who inwardly baptizes, and He can use all men at His 
will. <p>

(2) But how can such an one be a minister of the Church, and receive 
another into the body of Christ to which he does not himself belong? 
But he can intend to do what the Church does, and we suppose that he 
employs the Church's form; and Christ's power is not bound to baptized 
men any more than it is limited to His sacramental means. <p>

(3) But if such a man cannot receive the other sacraments, how can he 
do a greater thing, <i>sc.</i>, confer one of them? The answer is that 
this sacrament is necessary to salvation, and therefore God provides 
for its administration generally where it is desired (III. lxvii. 5). <p>

(See, further, a clear and fuller statement of the question in Blunt's 
Annotated Book of Common Prayer, Introduction to Offices for Holy 
Baptism.) <p>

It is unseemly, to say the least, for a priest to baptize his own child.  <p>

<i>Sponsors</i>. Although the 29th canon of 1603 requires that they 
shall be communicants, and decent regard for the office would demand the 
same thing, yet our recent permission to parents to act as sponsors, if 
it be so desired, seems to be a relaxation of the older discipline; 
for parents may be, and in fact often are, godless people. Apart from 
this permission, it were better to have a single sponsor or none at all 
beside parents, rather than that there should be a profane mockery of a 
solemn obligation by nominal spon<!--
HOLY BAPTISM. 573 
 --><A NAME="p573"></a>sors who have no intention of accepting the obligations involved. 
And the American Church makes provision for a contingency of this kind. 
Sponsors are to present the child, "when they can be had." <p>

The parental relation is not directly recognized in the rite.
 God-fathers and god-mothers present the child, receive it from the 
priest, and are charged with its spiritual care, which they may see to 
directly or indirectly. For in the case of a Christian household it may 
often be assumed that parents will do their duty in the religious 
education of their children. But if there be reason to apprehend the 
contrary, the sponsors become directly answerable to God and the 
Church, so far as their power extends. <p>

Private baptism is only lawful in case of "great cause and necessity." 
Of course, sponsors are not to be employed, for the child is required 
to be presented in church for a public reception there, when the 
sponsor's office is called for. (Qu.: Can a priest be permitted to 
violate the law of the Church when wilful lawlessness refuses to bring 
a child to church? May he plead the law of charity? Or must the sin 
lie at the door of those who know their duty and will not do it?)  <p>

<i>The recipient</i>. He who neither is baptized nor wishes to be 
baptized, cannot enter the kingdom of God (S. John iii. 5), for there 
is manifest contempt of the sacrament. But the desire proceeds from 
living faith, through which God inwardly sanctifies His creature; and 
since He is not limited to His own means, He may count the will for the 
deed, and inwardly justify without the outward sacrament (III. lxviii. 
2). <p>

Since the baptism of infants cannot lawfully be deferred, the rubric 
requires the pastor to admonish the people often that they defer not 
the baptism of their children longer than the first or second Sunday 
after their birth, or other holy-day falling between, unless upon a 
great and reason<!--
574 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS.
--><A NAME="p574"></a>
able cause. Such cause would doubtless be in many 
places the inclemency of the season. But parents should be also 
instructed not to let a mother's wish to be present stand in the way of 
dutiful obedience to a law based upon the great necessity of this 
sacrament. <p>

But in the case of adults there is more than one reason why Baptism 
should not be hastily administered : (1) The Church takes reasonable 
care not to be deceived, examining the candidate's faith and morals; 
(2) she needs time for instruction and spiritual exercises of the 
candidate; (3) she has usually preferred such solemn times as the eve 
of Easter and Pentecost, although special exigency, peril, and the like 
will override such reasons for delay. <p>

The sacrament is for sinners, ordained for their cleansing (Eph. v. 
26). But habitual sinners, who have no fixed intention of abandoning 
every evil course of life, cannot be baptized. ("He who made thee 
without thy cooperation, will not new create thee without it" -- S. 
Aug.) (1) They cannot be incorporated into Christ, which is the object 
of the sacrament (Gal. iii. 27); (2) there can be no cleansing when 
the will to sin remains; (3) there must be no falsity in the 
sacramental sign; and the outward sign of coming for ablution is 
utterly false if there be no fixed desire for inward purification (III. 
lxviii. 4).  <p>

<i>Conditions</i>. (1) The candidate for Holy Baptism is a voluntary, 
if a passive agent. ("Wilt thou be baptized in this faith?") It would 
be manifest profanity, and no sacrament, if the forum were used for one 
who was forced, or in any way unwilling to receive it. Man can die to 
the old life only by free renunciation of it; he must intentionally 
desire the new life. If such a profanation of the holy sacrament 
should ever occur, it must be treated as void; the sacrament must be 
duly administered when time penitent sincerely desires it (III. lxviii. 
7). <p>

(2) While true penitence for time past and a purpose to lead 
<!--
HOLY BAPTISM. 575
--><A NAME="p575"></a>
a new life are required, and the priest must have reasonable assurance 
of this, a confession to him is not to be required. If the penitent 
wish so to do he is not to be refused; but no penance is to he imposed, 
no absolution given; the confession is only for deeper repentance; for 
truer confession to God, for more serviceable counsels respecting the 
new life. <p>

(3) The justifying grace of God is given only to faith; therefore a 
right faith, explicit concerning the chief truths of time Gospel, 
implicit concerning all that God has revealed through His Church, is 
requisite (Rom. iii. 22). He that believeth and is baptized shall be 
saved" (S. Mark xvi. 16). <p>

This is not requisite for time character which is imprinted by God only 
and which is not perfected through faith. If one be truly baptized 
without the true faith, say, into an heretical sect, the baptism is 
valid; but no remission of sins is given, since that requires faith. 
("Dost thou believe all the articles of the Christian faith? I do.") <p>

One who is baptized may not have full faith respecting the sacrament; 
but he must intend to receive what Christ instituted and the Church 
delivers; that is implied in the very act of presenting himself. ("Wilt 
thou be baptized in this faith? That is my desire.")  <p>

<i>The baptism of infants</i>. (See the 27th Article of Religion.) Rom. 
v. 17, 18, applies to infants as included in the human race. They are 
able to receive the grace from their Lord, the character from God. S. 
John iii. 5 is absolutely universal in its application. Herein, also, 
is secured, as far as is possible, the nurture of children in the 
Christian life. They cannot bring the intention which is required in 
adults, but the intention of others offers them and is warranted by the 
Gospel. "As from others they derive the sins which are remitted in 
baptism, so by others they believe" (S. Aug., Cont. duas epist. Pelag., 
i. 22). 
<!--
576 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS.  
--><A NAME="p576"></a><p>

The parents may be unbelieving, but "children are offered to receive 
spiritual grace, not so much by those who hold them in their arms as by 
the whole society of the faithful, by whose charity they are united to 
the communion of the Holy Ghost" (S. Aug., ad Bonifac., ep. 98).  <p>

<i>Consent of parents</i>. It is contrary to natural justice that 
children who have not reached maturity of conscience and judgment 
should be baptized without their parents' consent. (Qu.: Suppose that 
one parent consents and the other refuses?) <p>

When they have reached such age as to be morally and spiritually 
responsible for their actions in what belongs to Divine and natural 
law, they are answerable for themselves, and may be baptized without 
their parents' consent. Human law then holds minors answerable for 
their actions in similar manner.  <p>

<i>What shall we say of idiots and the insane?</i> If the latter, in 
their previous rational state, penitently desired the sacrament, the 
suspension of outward manifestations of reason through brain disease is 
no hindrance to the grace of Christ which they need; they should be 
baptized. (Cp. Conf. S. Aug. iv. 4.) If they never expressed such a 
desire, and no charitable ground exist for supposing that they had 
inward desire and preparation, they should not be baptized. <p>

But the case of idiots, born so, is like that of infants. They are 
human in their immortal spiritual nature, although its outward action 
is impeded by defective physical constitution. They should undoubtedly 
be admitted into the kingdom of God, wherein they may have their place 
when they are set free from life-long bondage (III. lxviii. 12).  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. Confirmation.</h4><p>

Confirmation has its "outward and visible sign of an inward and 
spiritual grace." That this sign was used and 
<!--
CONFIRMATION. 577 
--><A NAME="p577"></a>
 appointed by the apostles is unquestionable, and it was therefore 
virtually, if not actually, "ordained by Christ Himself as a means 
whereby we receive the grace and a pledge to assure us thereof." <p>

But it holds a subordinate and complementary place with respect to Holy 
Baptism, as the means of conveying the seven-fold gifts which perfect 
the greater and more necessary sacrament. The new birth is only the 
first step towards moral and spiritual manhood. The natural virtues, as 
we have seen (Part I., page 69), need to be lifted up to the higher 
plane of the spiritual life, and the seven-fold gifts are ordained for 
this purpose, making the soul prompt to follow the guidance of the 
holy Spirit, and ready in His strength for conflict with the world, the 
flesh, and the devil, not only inwardly for self, but outwardly against 
Christ's enemies. <p>

This may justify Bishop Cosin's words, "The nature of this holy 
sacrament (for so we need not fear to call it in a right sense) will be 
more easily understood," etc. <p>

But the Catechism of the Anglican Church excludes it from the rank of 
the two greater sacraments "generally necessary to salvation." 
Otherwise it would always he conferred, as the Eastern Church, adhering 
to primitive usage, confers it, at the same time with Holy Baptism. <p>

It hardly needs to be added that wilful refusal, virtual contempt of 
God's ordinance, is a bar to salvation.  <p>

The visible sign or "matter." The Church has used as the matter of 
Confirmation either the laying on of hands, the sign of grace conveyed; 
or unction, the Scriptural sign of the Holy Ghost, or both of them. 
Both appear to have Scriptural warrant (Acts viii. 14; xix. 6. Heb. 
vi. 2. 2 Cor. i. 21. 1 John ii. 27). <p>

Those who have regarded Confirmation as a sacrament in the narrowest 
sense of the word have not agreed respecting the essential matter, the 
visible sign. But the Anglican    
<!--
578 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p578"></a>
 Church, by her action in recent ages, has shown that she regards the 
laying on of hands as the essential sign; the other as an added 
expression of significant meaning, which may be omitted without 
detriment to the rite.  <p>

<i>The words or form</i>. The Anglican Church does not seem to regard 
any form of words as essential to this ordinance, which fact again 
will distinguish it from the greater sacraments, wherein the words 
admit of no essential change.  <p>

The spiritual grace, as already intimated, is that of strength for 
spiritual combat. It is a further "sealing," in addition to that of 
Holy Baptism, and is so called in Holy Scripture. It also imprints a 
character. The spiritual priesthood of the Christian receives a grace 
for its outward manifestation.  <p>

<i>The age for Confirmation</i>. As a "sealing" and the complement of 
Holy Baptism, it naturally follows immediately after the greater 
sacrament (Tert., De Bapt. vii. 8; 5. Cypr., ep. 70). But the Anglican 
Church indicates the reason for deferring what is not absolutely 
necessary to salvation, saying, "To the end that Confirmation may be 
ministered to the more edifying of such as shall receive it, the Church 
hath thought good to order that none [hereafter] shall be confirmed but 
such as can say the creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments; and can also answer to such other questions as in the short catechism 
are contained; . . . to the end that children being now come to years 
of discretion [<i>i.e.</i>, power to distinguish between right and 
wrong]," etc. Here is no fixed rule established respecting the age of 
confirmation; nor is there any rule elsewhere appointed. To the same 
effect, but more precisely, is the charge given to sponsors "Ye are to 
take care that this child be brought to the bishop to he confirmed by 
him, so soon as he can say," etc. With careful instruction according to 
the charge given, children should ordinarily be ready on or before the 
<!--
CONFIRMATION. 579 
--><A NAME="p579"></a>
 age of twelve, and they will have power of moral "discretion;" but 
circumstances certainly vary too widely for any more precise rule to be 
given.  <p>

<i>Instruction of children</i>. Both the English and the American 
Church make this very explicitly the duty of parish priests, and of 
deacons whose official duty it is "to instruct the youth in the 
Catechism." The 59th canon of 1603 begins, "Every parson, vicar, or 
curate, upon every Sunday and holy-day, shall, for half an hour or 
more, examine and instruct the youth . . . in the Ten Commandments, the 
Articles of the Belief, and in the Lord's Prayer and shall diligently 
hear, instruct, and teach them the Catechism set forth in the Book of 
Common Prayer." The American Church is less definite, although she 
orders to the same effect (title i. can. 19) "The ministers of this 
Church who have charge of parishes or cures, shall be diligent in 
instructing the children in the Catechism." Whatever may be said of 
"Sunday-schools," it seems quite certain that "Bible lessons" there are 
no substitute for this obligation, but rather, on the contrary, an 
immoral evasion of a sacred duty.  <p>

The American Church has even ordered the duty of the diocesan with 
regard to Confirmation (title i. can. 13, &sect; 11) "Every bishop in 
this Church shall visit the churches within his diocese at least once 
in three years, for the purpose of . . . administering the apostolic 
rite of Confirmation," etc.  <p>

<i>Requisites for Confirmation</i>. (1) The unbaptized cannot be 
confirmed, for the grace is the complement of that of Holy Baptism. 
Baptism is the gate which admits to all Christian privileges; and 
outside of that door there are no sacraments. Therefore, if one 
discover that his reputed baptism was void, he should be again 
presented for Confirmation, 
<!--
580 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p580"></a>
 even if he have gone to the bishop before. (The same principle applies 
to Holy Orders. An unbaptized person cannot receive the grace; he has 
never been validly ordained, even if the outward form have been 
celebrated for him.) <p>

(2) Since Confirmation is a "sacrament of the living," he that receives 
it must be in a state of grace; he must bring a penitent and believing 
soul, according to his age and capacity; but the grace conferred, if 
rightly received, may deepen that penitence and faith. The faithful 
pastor has the one special opportunity in the life-time of his 
spiritual charge for the most direct and thorough private spiritual 
guidance. The age of the candidate, the tender and solemn feelings 
awakened, the dawning sense of responsibility to God and man, the 
special possibility at that period of a true conversion from the errors 
of childhood, open a way for God's priest to the inmost recesses of the 
soul, whither he may carry the Word of Life. Woe to him if he 
negligently prefer his own ease to this private ministration to each 
individual soul. <p>

Such a time is an eminently proper one to encourage the young disciple 
to make his first confession, if, as is probable, his conscience, being 
awakened by the admonitions given, be not at rest. He will need little 
encouragement to "open his grief," although the Church has given no 
such exhortation to him as he will receive at the time of his first 
communmon. <p>

(3) In case of doubt, conditional Confirmation is permissible, although 
the obligation is not to be pressed on one who reasonably thinks that 
he has received the sacrament.  <p>

The sick are to be confirmed if they desire and Confirmation can be 
had; but it is not to be urged as "necessary to salvation."  <p>

Finally, "there shall none be admitted to Holy Communion until such 
time as he be confirmed, or be ready and 
<!--
THE HOLY EUCHARIST. 581 
--><A NAME="p581"></a>
 desirous to be confirmed." If fit and prepared for the lesser rite, he 
is fit and prepared for the greater, and not otherwise. But, also, if 
fit and prepared for the receiving of the Lord's Body and Blood, he 
cannot refuse the grace and the "apostolic rite" without the mortal sin 
of contempt of God's order. If the thing be known, it is an "open and 
notorious sin. <p>

But the law of the Church which binds the priest's conscience always, 
because it is a negative precept, must not be misunderstood. As in the 
case of any other sin, a person who publicly presents himself while 
guilty of this contempt, cannot be excluded from Holy Communion without 
grave scandal. "Admission" must therefore be regarded as express 
consent given to a person's so presenting himself. A priest cannot give 
such consent without violation of law, which is an offence against God 
and man.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. The Holy Eucharist.</h4><p>

Moral Theology cannot present the law which binds our consciences 
respecting this transcendent mystery without assuming from Dogmatic 
Theology the revealed truth concerning it. The law is based on the 
truth. He that rejects the law virtually denies the truth. He that 
denies the truth knows no law claiming his obedience for which he must 
answer before the bar of God. <p>

It is not possible here to do more than briefly to state the truth as 
the Catholic Church receives it, and in her liturgies gives it, teaches 
it, and confesses it by her faith before God. <i>Lex credendi</i> is 
both <i>lex orandi</i> and <i>lex faciendi</i>. <p>

Many questions, also, regarding the manner of celebrating this august 
rite, answers to which bind the devout priest as part of his law, must 
be relegated to the department of liturgies and ritual. <p>

First in order of time the Holy Eucharist is a sacrifice, a sacred 
thing offered to God in memory of the Cross and Passion of the Lord, a 
sacrifice of thanksgiving for the inef<!--
582 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
 --><A NAME="p582"></a>fable benefits of that meritorious sacrifice which it presents 
before God through the great High Priest. It is offered for the 
obtaining of "remission of sins, and all other benefits of Christ's 
Passion." <p>

Secondly, it is a Holy Communion through which we participate in the 
perfect nature of Christ, perfect God and perfect man in one 
indissoluble unity, and through Him are united to one another in the 
mystical Body. It is the <i>"Viaticum"</i> as the appointed way to the 
future glory of the saints. We will consider the doctrine and the law 
of each.  <p>

(1) <i>The Holy Communion</i>. The outward part or sign is "bread and 
wine which the Lord hath commanded to be received." <p>

The inward part, the <i>"res sacramenti,"</i> is "the Body and Blood of 
Christ which are verily and indeed (spiritually) taken and received by 
the faithful," <i>i.e.</i>, the baptized people of Christ. <p>

Here at once we must notice a distinction between this sacrament and 
what we have previously examined. The inward part of Baptism is "a 
spiritual grace," whereas in the Holy Eucharist the inward part is 
distinct from "the benefits whereof we are partakers thereby." It is 
really and truly what is signified by the outward part. No such thing 
can be affirmed of Holy Baptism. The consecrated water is not <i>per 
se</i> the sacrament; that consists in the ablution with the use of the 
sacred Name; but receiving bread and wine in memory of the Lord's 
Passion is not the Holy Eucharist. This is completed in the 
consecration, although consumption perfects the sacrifice. <p>

The sacrament, sign and thing, was ordained for the food of the soul. 
The consecration makes such food by the power of Him who is the Giver 
and the Food. <p>

The truth of the Real Presence, then, is essential to a comprehension 
of the Divine law of the sacrament. The 
<!--
THE HOLY EUCHARIST. 583 
--><A NAME="p583"></a>
 inward part of the sacrament is really and truly in, with, and under 
the outward part, but spiritually, not after the manner of natural 
bodies, because the Lord's body is glorified; therefore not locally 
subject to laws of time and space. This Real Presence, real because not 
figurative nor merely virtual, is admitted to be unimaginable, because 
our knowledge of body is derived through the senses, and the body of 
the Lord is not subject to the laws of sense. The Presence is discerned 
by reason and faith alone. "If thou hast spiritually understood the 
words of Christ respecting His Body, they are spirit and life to thee; 
if thou hast understood them carnally, they are still spirit and life, 
but not for thee" (S. Aug., Super Joan. 27). <p>

But the Presence is the presence of Christ, God and Man; where His 
glorified Body is, there is His glorified Soul, and there, in special 
manner, is His Divinity, which was never separated, not even in death, 
from His human nature. The <i>"res sacramenti"</i> indeed is the 
glorified Body and Blood; but by natural "concomitance," all that 
Christ is, is there, making "His Flesh meat indeed, and His Blood drink 
indeed." He is in both parts of the sacrament, for they are one and not 
two; but He is there in different manner, and for different ends. 
Where His glorified Body is, there is His Blood, for "He dieth no 
more." But it is joined to His Body by natural concomitance, not by the 
act of consecration. And the case is similar in the sacrament of the 
Precious Blood. Both re-present the "full, perfect, and sufficient 
sacrifice," but the sacrament of the Precious Blood specially 
represents that which was shed for the "remission of sins."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

Christ is not present after the manner of bodies with their three 
dimensions. However the consecrated elements  
<!--
584 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p584"></a>
 are divided, the Presence is not withdrawn from any part. Each and 
every part is a perfect sacrament, outward and inward.  <p>

<i>The law of the sacrament.</i> The matter, the outward and visible 
sign, must be, (1) wheaten bread, the purest that can be obtained. 
The common article sold under that name, more or less mixed, may 
suffice for a valid sacrament; but believing reverence will certainly 
seek for something different, if it may be had; "the best and purest 
wheat bread that conveniently may be gotten" (English rubric). <p>

It may be leavened or unleavened; and the laws of the Catholic Church 
from the earliest ages have differed in this respect; but the words of 
the English rubric as they now stand -- <i>sc.</i>, "It shall suffice 
that the bread be such as is usual to be eaten " -- compared with the 
rubric of 1549, suggest that the law of the Western Church is not 
repealed, but only permission given to deviate from it for weighty and 
sufficient reasons. Very good reasons, based on decency and reverence, 
may be given for complying with the old law and custom of the English 
Church, as renewed at the Reformation "It is meet that the bread 
prepared for the Communion be made . . . unleavened and round, as it 
was afore, but without all manner of print," etc. "And men must not 
think less to be received in part than in the whole, but in each of 
them the whole Body of our Saviour Jesus Christ." <p>

(2) The wine must be true wine; <i>i.e.</i>, the juice of the grape, 
not that of currants, apples, or the like. Christ so constituted his 
sacrament, and man has no power to change it. The unfermented juice of 
the grape is certainly unlawful material; whether it annul the 
sacrament is, perhaps, an open question. But, also, it must not be 
overlooked that pure wine being liable to acetous fermentation, if that 
change be complete, there can be made no sacrament 
<!--
THE HOLY EUCHARIST. 585 
--><A NAME="p585"></a>
 of the Blood. The consecration must be repeated with true wine.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup>  <p>

The mixed chalice, following the example of our Lord, who blessed the 
cup to which a little water had been added, has the warrant of all 
parts of the Catholic Church, was required by rubric at the 
Reformation, and is most expressively significant of the union of the 
Divine and human, first in the Incarnation, then in the Holy Communion. 
But the omission of the rubric undoubtedly suspends the law. Whether 
the opposite usage is now obligatory is quite another question. (See 
the recent judgment of the Archbishop of Canterbury.) <p>

The quantity of water added must be very small.  <p>

<i>The form</i>. The words of consecration spoken in the person of 
Christ, who invisibly consecrates, are invariable. The nature of the 
sacrament itself is illustrated by comparing the variable words in 
communicating the faithful with the absolutely unchangeable form of 
consecration. S. Thomas Aquinas, III. lxxviii. 1, clearly presents the 
subject "This sacrament differs from the other sacraments in two 
particulars; first, that this sacrament is perfected in the 
consecration of matter; but other sacramental rites in the use of 
consecrated matter. Secondly, in those the consecration consists only 
in a benediction, . . . but in the Holy Eucharist it consists in a 
change which can be accomplished only by God's power. Hence the 
minister in this sacrament can only utter the words. [In Baptism he 
must pour the water; in Confirmation he must lay his hands on the 
candidate, etc.] And, therefore, the form of this sacrament, as 
suitable to the end, differs from other like forms in two respects. 
First, the others imply the use 
<!--
586 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p586"></a>
 of a sign, as, 'I baptize thee' (or, 'Receive the Holy Ghost for the 
office and work of a priest in the Church of God, now committed unto 
thee by the imposition of our hands'). But the form of this sacrament 
expresses only the consecration of matter. And, secondly, other like 
forms are expressed, like those just given, in the person of the 
minister, either as doing the act, or claiming authority, or imploring 
the Divine gift (as in the absolution of the liturgy, 'Have mercy upon 
you,' etc.). But the form of this sacrament is uttered in the person of 
Christ, that all may understand that the minister contributes nothing 
to its perfection, but only utters the words" (while Another 
consecrates the elements).  <p>

<i>The minister</i>. The priest in his ordination receives authority to 
consecrate the Holy Eucharist. He is enjoined to be "a faithful 
dispenser of the Word of God and of His holy sacraments," of which this 
one is chief. But he needs power of jurisdiction if he exert his office 
for the benefit of the faithful. He is not a minister to all mankind, 
but to that flock committed to his care. And we have seen already (page 
570) the law of the Church which regulates this jurisdiction. <p>

If Holy Orders are indelible, however, lawlessness or any other sin -- 
<i>e.g.</i>, heresy or schism -- does not take away the power of making 
a valid Eucharist. The priest sins in using his functions, and the 
<i>res sacramenti</i> gives him no spiritual grace, but rather that 
condemnation for unworthy approach to sacred mysteries of which the 
apostle speaks. And the faithful are certainly bound to avoid him, and 
not to be partakers of his sins (2 Ep. S. John v. 11). <p>

Distinction, however, must be made between one who is publicly 
sentenced by the Church and one who is privately known to be wrong. For 
the latter is still the minister of the Church, and it is not partaking 
of his sin to join in his sacrifice where he has jurisdiction, and to 
receive the Holy Communion from his sinful hands. 
<!--

<i>Doctrine and law of reception</i>. How can we express in few words 
the benefits which are partaken by a devout reception of the Holy 
Communion? They are all which Christ gives to the loving soul; for, in 
giving Himself, He, gives all -- (1) Increase of grace previously 
bestowed, sustaining and strengthening the spiritual life; (2) new 
gifts of grace according to devout prayer for it; (3) the weakening of 
sinful concupiscences, so that devout reception becomes a spiritual 
medicine for the weak; (4) through increase of love, and therefore more 
sincere contrition, pardon for venial sins committed; (5) union with 
Christ (S. John vi. 56); (6) union with His members in the one mystical 
Body; (7) preservation in future temptations; and, lastly, (8) the 
pledge of glory (v. 54). <p>

This is a sacrament of the <i>living</i>, and he that eats niust first 
be cleansed (1 Cor. xi. 29). If he himself place impediments in his 
way, he cannot be united with Christ, though he receive His Body and 
His Blood. (See 29th Article of Religion.) He is not a "partaker of 
Christ;" <i>i.e.</i>, he does not spiritually receive the precious 
nutriment of his soul.  <p>

The distinction, then, between a sacramental reception and a spiritual 
communion is real and fundamental. The sacramental may lack the 
spiritual effect, while, on the other hand, the rubric respecting the 
communion of the sick gives most explicit instruction concerning 
spiritual communion where there is a hearty desire and preparation for 
sacramental communion.  <p>

Children who have not reached the "age of discretion" are not in the 
Western Church admitted to sacramental communion, yet it would surely 
he derogatory to the love of their Saviour to suppose that the devout 
desire of the Church which brings them to Holy Baptism is unavailing 
for their spiritual communion with him. <p>

But he that receives in mortal sin is further guilty of sacrilege. He 
signifies by his act that he is united with 
<!--
588 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p588"></a>
 Christ and incorporated in the mystical Body, which cannot be without 
faith and love. Therefore he acts a profane lie. <p>

He may do this ignorantly -- ignorant of the law which he has broken, 
but which does not excuse him for his ignorance; or, ignorant of his 
sin, because he has not examined himself as he is bound to do (1 Cor. 
xi. 28); and he sins in receiving, because his very ignorance is 
sinful. But, again, he may grieve for his sin, and resolve to avoid 
it, while he has not that perfect contrition which would spring from 
perfect love; then his contrition will be deepened in the reception 
itself. He has not sinned in the reception. Or he may have forgotten 
his sin even with due examination of himself; then his general 
contrition will doubtless make him a worthy communicant (III. lxxx. 4). <p>

What was said (page 564) with reference to the minister's giving the 
sacraments to the unworthy need not be here repeated.  <p>

<i>Fasting communion</i>. Catholic custom and law are unvarying in this 
respect. The few exceptions only prove the rule. S. Augustine is 
trustworthy witness to usage when he says (Ep. ad Januarium, 54) that 
that custom "is observed throughout the world;" so that he is bold to 
say: "It pleased the Holy Ghost that in honour of so great a sacrament 
the Lord's Body should enter the mouth before other food." <p>

The words "fasting communion" may be somewhat misleading, since fasts 
are an exercise of penitential devotion. Such fasting precedes the day 
of reception; but here the words simply imply that the Holy Food shall 
be the first to be taken on the day of reception, counting from the 
beginning of that day. <p>

Communion in the evening naturally involves a violation of this law and 
custom. <p>

Spiritual devotion, from which are gained the effects of this 
sacrament, naturally demands that the offering of the 
<!--
THE HOLY EUCHARIST. 589 
--><A NAME="p589"></a>
 soul in Holy Eucharist be the first duty of the new day; and if an act 
of private thanksgiving be added, there will be, after reception, a 
decent separation made between the heavenly banquet and the common 
table of home, with the other occupations of the day. <p>

At the same time, it should surely be remembered that "fasting 
communion" is not a moral law, but an outward observance, which, like 
any other positive law of Church or State, admits of exceptions. Even 
where the law is strictest, exception is made in ease of communion of 
the sick. And parity of reasoning may apply the same judgment to other 
cases of infirmity, especially in a rigorous northern climate. For no 
merely positive law overrides the certain demands of a weak, sickly 
nature; nor should such be deprived of sacramental communion when it 
may be had. <p>

(Qu.: If necessity, which knows no law, compel a violation of the rule 
for the sake of charity, is there any good reason for partial 
abstinence?)  <p>

Decent reverence for the consecrated water of Holy Baptism requires 
that it be carefully removed; say, by an outlet at the bottom of the 
font, or otherwise. And yet that water is not a sacrament. But the 
sacrament of the altar is perfected in the consecration, and the <i>res 
sacramenti</i> remains there as long as the outward part endures in its 
natural condition of bread and wine. Hence comes the obligation of 
reverent consumption of what remains after communion, and the profanity 
of carelessness respecting fragments of the consecrated elements. 
Wilful negligence is due either to unbelief in the Church's doctrine or 
to sinful profanity. <p>

Also, it will be seen that if taken from the church to the sick, or 
kept for that purpose, it is still the sacrament, both matter and 
thing.  <p>

The "Viaticum." Although the Greek Church gives the Holy Communion to 
infants after their baptism, the general 
<!--
590 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p590"></a>
 law of necessity of sacramental reception seems to apply to those who 
have some use of reason, however imperfect it may be, and who can 
therefore offer some inward devotion in their receiving. This being 
understood, it appears that the <i>Viaticum</i> should be administered 
to all baptized persons who are old enough to receive it devoutly, and 
have shown some desire for it, some inward devotion to the Lord who 
died for them, some contrition for their errors and their sins, the 
minister putting the most charitable construction upon words uttered in 
feebleness, and perhaps in pain. <p>

The fact that before the priest arrives to give the <i>Viaticum</i> the 
sick has lost his reason, can hardly be considered a bar to fruitful 
reception, if previously he were penitently desirous and prepared to 
receive it. The sick is like the infant receiving Holy Baptism, but has 
added his own faith and love to his spiritual needs. If he is to be 
debarred, would not distraction of mind at the instant of receiving be 
also a bar to fruitful reception on the part of the most sincere 
penitent who presents himself at the altar? Surely the love of Christ 
finds no obstacle in such a case. This also is the law of the Church 
whenever she has made any declaration upon the subject; <i>e.g.</i>, of 
the Fourth Council of Carthage, can. 76: "If it is believed that he is 
dying, having sought reconciliation with God before his delirium, let 
him be reconciled by the laying on of hands, and let him receive the 
Holy Eucharist." One who has never had the use of reason, or has never 
shown evidence of penitence and desire for the <i>Viaticum</i>, must be 
left to his Judge. (Qu.: Can the deacon, in case of absolute necessity, 
carry the <i>Viaticum</i> and administer the same?)<p>

Frequent communion is rather a matter of counsel than of precept. But 
the law of the Anglican Church fixes a minimum in three times a year. 
(Canons 21 and 22 of 1603): "Every lay person is bound to receive the 
Holy Commun<!--
591 THE HOLY EUCHARIST.  
 --><A NAME="p591"></a>ion thrice every year," "whereof the feast of Easter to be one." 
Christmas and Whitsuntide, though not named in those canons, are 
properly the other two seasons for receiving.  <p>

(2) The Eucharistic sacrifice is offered to God as "the memorial His 
Son has commanded us to make," saying, "Do this in remembrance of Me." 
It is offered as a sacrifice of thanksgiving "for the innumerable 
benefits procured unto us" by Jesus' Passion and Death, His 
Resurrection and Ascension, for it is not the sacrifice of a dead 
victim, but it is offered by a living High Priest who offers Himself. 
It is offered through the merits of our Saviour, and in its inward part 
offered by Him for the "obtaining the remission of sins and all other 
benefits of His Passion," for those who offer and for "all His whole 
Church." <p>

It is then the duty of every priest to fulfil the function for which he 
was ordained and to offer this holy sacrifice as often as he may, the 
ordinary maximum being once daily, except on special occasions like 
Easter, Whitsunday, and Christmas, or when serving two congregations. 
The Anglican Church seems to have fixed no minimum; but as the question 
now before us is of the offering of the Christian sacrifice, not of the 
communion of the people, it is evident that the priest who has no cure 
is not released from his obligation of making frequently the 
Eucharistic oblation. <p>

The American Church has omitted the rubric requiring the presence of 
some of the faithful at the sacrifice to represent the congregation. 
But the law must still be considered binding that, except in case of 
unforeseen accident, there shall always be some one at least to unite 
with the priest, and claim the promise that "when two or three are 
gathered in Christ's name, He will be with them." <p>

Christ has been immolated once for all; but in this memorial sacrifice 
the "one, perfect, and sufficient sacrifice" 
<!--
592 THE LAW OF SACRAMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p592"></a>
 is re-presented to God, and its effects become fruitful for us and for 
all in whose behalf it is offered (III. lxxxiii. 1). <p>

Provision is made for fulfilling S. Paul's injunction through S. 
Timothy (1 Tim. ii. 1), at the Offertory prayer, and for the departed 
after the consecration, in the words "we and all Thy whole Church;" and 
although there is no positive law to that effect, there can be no good 
reason for not inviting the faithful to join inwardly in those special 
intercessions for individuals which the devout priest will desire to 
make at those periods in the liturgy. <p>

<hr><p>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a></a> Two elements do not make two sacraments. There is one spiritual food 
(S. John vi. 56), though there are two outward parts, because it 
derives its virtue from the Passion of Christ which it commemorates, 
and in that Passion His Blood was separated from His Body. <p>

<a name="n_2"><a href="#n2">{2}</a></a> As there is reason for thinking that the consecration of the bread 
is completed before the other consecration is begun, it may be held 
that the previous consecration counts, and that the wine only, if it 
can possibly be obtained, need be consecrated. <p>
