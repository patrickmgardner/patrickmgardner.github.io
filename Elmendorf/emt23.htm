<h3>CHAPTER IV.  RIGHT AND JUSTICE.</h3>  <p>

THE subject of the next three chapters -- viz., Right and Justice, 
their violations through injury, and contracts based on justice -- 
might here be considered as questions of Moral Theology alone, and no 
reference might be made to civil law except when it conflicts, which it 
rarely does, with the principles of our science. <p>

But, even with all the rudeness necessary in general laws, which, as 
such, cannot recognize the inevitable exceptions occurring and 
recognized in morals, the civil and the common law are in large measure 
so admirable an application of justice to human life, and the practical 
use of some acquaintance with the first principles of common law as 
thus applied is so great, that it seems best to consider onr topics 
both from the point of view of Moral Theology and of the laws of civil 
society.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Definitions and divisions.</h4><p>

Justice, as we have seen (Part III., page 274), is a moral virtue 
inclining the will to render to every one what is right, <i>i.e.</i>, 
his due. Our Lord gives the law and its criterion (S. Matt. vii. 12), 
although His law, no doubt, extends beyond the natural virtue of 
justice to the domain of supernatural charity. Duty, the obligation of 
giving what is due, is correlative with right.  <p>

<i>Divisions</i>. (1) Legal justice was defined (page 275) as the form 
of justice which gives to society its rights. But if we take the 
narrower definition of it -- <i>sc.</i>, civil justice ex<!--
DEFINITIONS AND DIVISIONS. 523 
 --><A NAME="p523"></a>pressed in written law -- the supremacy of moral over legal justice 
is emphatically presented in Blackstone's remark (iii. page 392), that 
"a second trial is not granted in cases of strict right or <i>summum 
jus</i>, where the rigorous exaction of strict legal justice is hardly 
reconcilable to conscience." <i>Summum jus summa injuria</i>. <p>

The same principle will be illustrated, also, by the case of 
"accident;" special inconvenience of general law from unusual 
circumstances will warrant equitable jurisdiction from a court of 
chancery (Blackst. iii. 431). It will rectify some mistakes, some 
frauds, which may not be cognizable by common law; it will issue 
injunctions to prevent invasion of rights. <p>

(2) Distributive justice gives honours and imposes burdens in due and 
just proportions (Part III., page 285). <p>

(3) Commutative justice regulates exchange between private individuals. <p>

(4) Retributive justice is a form of (2), exacting penalties for
 wrong- doing. <p>

Note that in particular matters of justice, ordinarily and regularly, 
lawyers are the most competent judges; in matters of justice which are 
to be conducted by general rules, as, also, in religion and charity, 
theology is supreme (Duct. Dubitant. I. iv. rule 10).  <p>

<i>Jus</i>, right, is the lawful claim to do, to keep, or to obtain 
anything whatsoever for one's own benefit. It is the object of the 
virtue justice.  <p>

Divisions are (1) right in things already possessed ("things real"); 
(2) right to things not so possessed ("things personal"); <i>i.e.</i>, 
<i>jus in re</i>, and <i>jus ad rem</i>. These give rise to real and 
personal actions in law. <p>

Property is rights in things (Blackst. ii. c. ii.). This, as <i>jus in 
re</i>, is either real or personal, the former being lands, tenements, 
and hereditaments. But the last divis<!--
524 RIGHT AND JUSTICE. 
 --><A NAME="p524"></a>ion, expressing all that can be inherited, will include, also, 
personal property (c. xxiv.). To distinguish then things personal, 
they are called chattels, which are either chattels real, as a lease or 
a mortgage, or chattels personal, viz., movables (c. xxv.). <p>

Property, as possession, is either absolute or qualified. This fact 
will give ns a four-fold division of right; viz., (1) dominion; (2) 
use; (3) usufruct, use with further benefits; (4) service and 
jurisdiction, as the bishop's right, the paternal right, the right of 
masters, etc.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Dominion.</h4><p>

Absolute dominion belongs only to God (Ps. xxiv. 1). But man can 
rightly have property as against other men (Part III., page 302), 
receiving it from God, and being in it independent of others. This is 
both natural law and positive Divine law (Gen. i. 28). <p>

Human dominion, or the right to dispose of a thing in any manner as 
one's own, is (1) perfect when there is the right to dispose of the 
thing and of its use; (2) imperfect if the right cover only one of 
these. <p>

"Eminent domain" (<i>"dominium altum"</i>) is in the state, since its 
claim is superior to that of individuals; "domlnium humile" is that of 
private persons. <p>

A qualified right of property is in many cases recognized as existing 
(1) in the case of water, as appropriated by occupancy (Blackst. ii. 
403). Obstructions, therefore, the fouling or diverting of water, etc., 
may constitute legal injury as well as a violation of justice, and 
often of charity. <p>

(2) In "bailment," also -- <i>i.e.</i>, delivery of goods in trust  -- 
qualified property is acquired; <i>e.g.</i>, by a carrier, an 
innkeeper, a pawnbroker. A servant in charge does not so acquire. <p>

<i>Jus ad rem</i> is another example of qualified property, called 
"property in action," or "chose in action;" <i>e.g.</i>, money due on 
a bond, or a promise or covenant to do any<!--
HOW IS DOMINION ACQUIRED? 525 
 --><A NAME="p525"></a>thing (Blackst. ii. 397). If there be failure in such a case, 
common law will give compensation for the qualified property. <p>

Imperfect dominion is direct when it is over a thing; it is indirect 
when it is over the use of the thing. <p>

Man has, by Divine gift, the second, <i>"dominium utile,"</i> over his 
goods of body and soul. He has not direct dominion in either of these 
goods. (See notes on the Sixth Commandment, page 515.) <p>

Over external goods, however, be has both direct and perfect dominion. 
(Qu.: Can he rightly have dominium utile over another person?)  <p>

Children and the insane are not incapable of dominion through a 
guardian. With respect to dominion on the part of minors, common law is 
more liberal than the civil law -- <i>i.e.</i>, the rights of parents 
over children, so far as regulated by human law, are more restricted by 
the fornier; but both common and civil law agree with the law of nature 
that the parent has perfect dominion over his child's earnings while 
that child is under age, "the child living with him and being 
maintained by him" (Blackst. i. 453). But the former makes the 
emancipation of the infant very easy; for the father may relinquish all 
his right to the services and earnings of a minor child, in which case 
the child will have perfect dominion over them. <p>

In the case of other property held by the child, as by gift, bequest, 
etc., the father, if he be appoiiited guardian of that property, stands 
in the same position as a trustee; and the child's dominion is limited 
by the power of administration which is in the parent as guardian of 
the property in question. The father receives the profits of his 
child's property, but must account for them when his child comes of 
age.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. How is dominion acquired?</h4><p>

(1) Dominion is acquired by "occupancy " -- <i>i.e.</i>, the actual 
<!--
526 RIGHT AND JUSTICE. 
--><A NAME="p526"></a>
 taking possession of what belongs to no one; <i>e.g.</i>, wild land or 
animals -- under requisite conditions; <i>sc.</i>, (a) that the thing 
is a proper object of private dominion (Qu.: land?), and belongs to no 
one; (b) that no human law stands in the way; (c) that the occupier 
intends to make it his own, and actually takes it (Instit. III. tit. 
i.). <p>

<i>Ferae naturae</i> (Blackst. ii. page 392). By <i>jus gentium</i> 
beasts, birds, and fish are the property of the captor, and may be 
taken anywhere, but the owner of the land may prohibit entry thereon. 
If such wild animals escape from their captor, they become the property 
of any one who captures them again. By common law, however, there is a 
qualified property in them, <i>"per industriam hominis,"</i> in 
confining or taming them. But this is only while they are actually 
possessed through occupancy, unless, like turkeys and pigeons, they are 
in the habit of returning. (Op. the seal as an international question 
in 1891.) It is felony, however, to steal those which are used as food 
(page 394). Dogs, cats, etc., are not so protected by common law.  <p>

(2) Finding, or discovery, is either of (a) <i>"thesaurus,"</i> money 
lost; or (b) of other things lately lost; or (c) of things abandoned; 
or (d) of things not owned (Instit. ii. tit. i. 9). <i>Thesaurus</i> 
goes with the land if found by the owner of the same; "treasure trove," 
however, may be reclaimed by the owner if he appear. (Op. Roman and 
common law.)  <p>

(3) <i>Prescription</i> either (a) gives some acquired dominion; or (b) 
some positive obligation, though unfulfilled, is released through lapse 
of time. Divide, then, into acquisitive and liberative prescription. <p>

Human law has the right to sanction this mode of obtaining dominion, 
without the previous owner's consent, as morally necessary for the 
common good; for otherwise 
<!--
HOW IS DOMINION ACQUIRED? 527  
--><A NAME="p527"></a>
 strifes would often arise from uncertain possession. Due prescription 
in transferring dominion therefore is obligatory <i>in foro 
conscientiae</i>. <p>

There are five conditions of lawful prescription <p>

<i>(a) "Sit res apta; (b) fides bona sit; (c) titulus quo que justus; (d) 
possideas juste; (e) completo tempore legis."</i><p>

The first condition (a) requires that the thing possessed be a salable 
thing over which dominion has been exercised (not a loan, etc.), 
public, undisputed, certain, and uninterrupted. <p>

(b) The second condition is a firm persuasion that the title acquired 
is one's own; otherwise there is moral (Qu.: legal?) obligation of 
restitution. The same principle applies to liberative prescription. <p>

Ignorance of the law does not constitute this "good faith;" although 
ignorance of facts may do so (Digest. xxii. vi. 4, 6). According to the 
civil law, subsequent knowledge of facts does not vitiate legal 
possession, whatever moral obligation there may be (Digest. xli. iii. 
48). <p>

(c) The title must appear to be a true one; <i>e.g.</i>, buying, gift, etc. <p>

(d) But a long period of uninterrupted possession is equivalent to a 
title of some other nature. This length of time, however, is different 
when accompanied with other title, and again when so unaccompanied. It 
differs also widely in the case of movables (in most cases nuder the 
statute of limitations the period being six years) and of immovables, 
which require a much longer period for prescriptive title. <p>

Thus, by the statute of limitations, no entry shall be made upon lands 
unless within twenty years after a man's right shall accrue (Blackst. 
iii. page 178). <p>

Prescription is suspended by the minority of the claimant, and by other 
insuperable obstacles. <p>

It does not apply to anything fraudulently obtained, for there must be 
<i>bona fides</i>; and no length of possession under such circumstances 
can make a wrong become a right. 
<!--
528 RIGHT AND JUSTICE.  
--><A NAME="p528"></a> <p>

Liberative <i>prescription</i>, also -- <i>i.e.</i>, lapse of right -- has 
its term fixed by civil law. But what law permits may not always be 
what a good conscience can rightly claim.  <p>

(4) Accession. The thing acquired may be so united with one's own 
property by natural processes that dominion is gained over it. Thus, 
the offspring of brutes goes with the mother, "partus sequitur ventrem" 
(Instit. II. i. 31, 33 and trees, etc., go with the soil. The
 <i>bona-fide</i> possessor of land is entitled to all gathered fruits, 
unless the owner claim them; but there can be no action for gathered 
fruit against the <i>"usufructuarius"</i> (<i>vid. infra</i>). But if 
one be possessor of the land <i>mala fide</i>, he must restore what he 
has gathered or compensate for it. <p>

"Specification" is another example of accession. Manufacture with 
another's materials, if in good faith, gives property in the product, 
the materials being paid for (Qu.: legal rights?). This if the thing 
be properly new; but if merely the form be altered, as in making a 
coat, the owner of the material can still claim it (Blackst. ii. page 
404). <p>

<i>Alluvion</i>, another example of the same, is the slow (not the 
sudden) growth of land on the bank of a running stream, which gives 
rightful claim to the accession. <p>

<i>"Adjunction"</i> is a similar example, If a man build on his own 
ground with another's materials, he owns what accedes to the soil, but 
the other has a lien on the materials. If any one build on rented 
ground, the building becomes the property of him to whom the ground 
belongs; but if the builder acted <i>bona fide</i> he must he 
compensated; if he acted <i>mala fide</i> he can only take away the 
materials. (Note that the present law of "betterments" is uncertain.) <p>

In case of confusion of goods without consent of both parties, the 
entire property belongs to him whose dominion is invaded (Blackst. ii. 
page 405). <p>

We are discussing right and justice, but the higher law 
<!--
HOW IS DOMINION ACQUIRED? 529 
--><A NAME="p529"></a>
 of Christian charity may overrule the demands of strict justice in all 
such cases.  <p>

(5) <i>Conveyance</i>. Another's title may be transferred to a new 
owner for a satisfactory consideration, or as a gift. (See the chapter 
on Contracts.)  <p>

<i>Use and usufruct</i>. The first is the right of using another's 
property, the substance of it being preserved for the owner; the second 
is the right of using and enjoying it; <i>i.e.</i>, of taking the 
fruits for one's own on like conditions. This gives <i>dominium 
utile</i>. The fair expenses connected with the thing are to be paid, 
and also all ordinary obligations; <i>e.g.</i>, an annuity on the 
property. It must be restored in reasonably good condition, and the 
owner must not injure the <i>usufruct</i>; <i>e.g.</i>, parents using 
children's goods. Use, then, does not apply to perishable goods, as 
articles of food. <p>

The <i>usufructuarius</i> can sell his right, but the <i>usuarius</i> 
cannot. <p>

Tenant right, subletting, etc., sometimes involve grave moral questions 
which cannot be here discussed. (See, further, the chapter on 
Contracts.)<p>
