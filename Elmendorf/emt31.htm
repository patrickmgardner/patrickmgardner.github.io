<h3>CHAPTER XII. DUTIES AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE STATE AND OF ITS 
CITIZENS.</h3><p>

The state is a community of men living together for earthly ends, under 
one law and one government, whose function is to execute the law and 
defend the society against assaults from within, sedition, privy 
conspiracy and rebellion; treason and war from without. <p>

The Divine law respecting the state is given, Rom. xiii. 1-7; Matt. 
xxii. 21.  <p>

(I.) <i>Its rights are:</i> (1) In the person of its duly constituted 
representatives, to be obeyed within its due limits. Herein its 
sanction is Divine, and obedience is part of the Gospel law. <p>

But difficulty at once arises in determining those limits; the higher 
the functions of the state are placed the greater the difficulty. (See 
Dan. ii. 44.) In general, however, these limits are (a) The moral law, 
the law of Christ, which is superior; and (b) the Catholic Church, as 
guardian of religion and morals, which, in her sphere, has a superior 
law. If any part of that church intrude on the secular sphere, <i>per 
contra</i>, the state is supreme. <p>

(Cases: The Roman Catholic communion; the Mormons.) <p>

(c) Personal rights or family rights, of both which the state is the 
appointed guardian. If the state touch these, its ordinance is null. <p>

(2) The state has eminent domain over the lives and property of its 
citizens. For personal rights would be iaoperative without the 
protection and order of civil society. 
<!--

Both life and property, accordingly, are demanded in case of extreme 
need. Its law commonly accepts a man's last will and testament, but may 
annul them. <p>

(3) The state has the right to make war in national defence, and to 
put down sedition by force. Therefore it has the right to use the lives 
and property of its citizens for this purpose. <p>

Herein is clear proof that the state is an entity, and not a mere 
aggregate of individuals. For acts are done by men which, if privately 
done, would be robbery and murder (Whewell, v. &sect; 837). <p>

(4) The state has the right to punish, even with loss of life, for 
public and private wrongs (Rom. xiii. 4). For it has the right to do 
what is necessary for its existence (Qu. : The right to punish injury 
done to one's self, as a member of the state?), and is bound to protect 
its citizens. <p>

(5) It has the right of contract under the laws of commutative justice; 
and <p>

(6) In general, of all acts necessary to its preservation or its 
 well-being. Such are to impose taxes (Rom. xiii. 6, 7), including 
tariffs; to require the education of its children (Qu.: To try to 
educate them itself?); to regulate or repress, by fine or other 
punishment, public vices which injure its social life (lotteries, 
gambling, drinking-saloons), even when these are not direct violations 
of the moral law.  <p>

(II.) <i>The obligations and duties of the state</i> correspond to its rights. <p>

Through the ministry of those who are voters, and their representatives 
in executive, legislative, and judicial power, it is bound (a) to 
preserve itself in well-being, through national defence against enemies 
without and within, and for this end to provide and sustain an 
efficient army and police; (b) to uphold aud enforce the laws 
impartially with respect to all, high and low; (c) to make just laws 
for the purposes of its own existence. Hence 
<!--

--><A NAME="p646"></a>
 arise the duties of civil station, in governors, legislators, judges, 
officers of the army, etc. <p>

The special virtue of the state, therefore, and of those who represent 
it, is justice, both distributive, commutative, and retributive. <p>

Further than this, the question has difficulty, because first must be 
decided what is the function of the state. Is it more than to protect 
the lives, liberty, property of its citizens, as a social police, 
leaving all other moral, intellectual, religions, and charitable 
functions to the voluntary association of its people? If so, we escape, 
to a large degree, the clashing of different means for similar ends. Is 
that government the best which governs least? The tendency just now is 
altogether in the opposite direction. (Bennett law in Wisconsin.) <p>

Or has the state moral duties; <i>e.g.</i>, to promote purity and good 
living by repressing obscene publications, lotteries, etc.; to promote 
science by observatories, etc.; intelligence by universities, etc.; 
humanity by putting down the slave-trade, cruelty to animals, towards 
Indians; hospitals, asylums, poor-houses, etc.; education, however 
imperfect, by public schools? Or are all these the province of 
voluntary associations on the part of those only who approve, and agree 
in the means for promoting these objects? <p>

If the former, we are logically led into the religious sphere, and a 
conflict of church and state ensues. Besides, that cannot be duty which 
cannot be well done. <p>

Or, thirdly, while providing primarily for its own preservation and the 
social well-being of its members, may the state -- <i>i.e.</i>, 
governors, judges, legislators -- be indirectly influenced by moral 
considerations, without making them the primary object of action; 
<i>e.g.</i>, not enforcing immoral contracts, bets, etc.; choosing for 
necessary taxation what injures the moral standing of the people; 
providing schools for those not otherwise taught; aiding parochial 
schools, etc.? 
<!--

--><A NAME="p647"></a><p>

Notice, also, that many laws -- <i>e.g.</i>, marriage laws, punishments 
of crime, etc. -- are indirectly auxiliaries to the moral education of 
the people, stamping with the reprobation of society what are also 
sins. Emanating from the conscience of a people who are generally 
Christian in their training, if not in their lives, they stamp with 
public reprobation vices which civilization, as such, cannot check. It 
did not in Greece or Rome; on the contrary, they grew with that 
civilization as they did in the renaissance of it. <p>

Duties to the state correspond to the duties of the state, and need not 
be further developed. Respect, obedience, support, defence are implied, 
and these as Christian obligation. The state has divine right. What 
rights, is a debatable question (Whewell, &sect; 881). <p>

Sins against the state are, (1) sedition; if secret, privy conspiracy; 
if open force, rebellion; like schism, setting up a rival power against 
that which has Divine right. (2) Fraud, in depriving it of its just 
dues. (3) Treason (Whewell, &sect; 883), in this nation, "giving aid 
and comfort" to its enemies. What has been said in Part III. of 
obligations to authorities can here, mutalis mutandis, he applied once 
more. But our space forbids more than this brief allusion to topics 
which, like so many previously introduced, can only receive a cursory 
glance in these first Elements of Moral Theology.  <p>
