<h3>CHAPTER IV.  RELIGION AND VICES OPPOSED TO IT.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Introduction.</h4><p>

<i>In a very general sense every virtue contains the idea of what is 
due to Divine or human law.</i><p>

So viewed, justice embraces them all. But, as a special virtue, it 
regards the good as what is due to our neighbour, as general justice is 
concerned with what is due to the community or to God. In both of 
these, avoiding the evil and doing the good are integral parts. In 
doing the good, in acting justly, equality in relations is established 
as far as is possible. In shunning the evil, in avoiding injustice, 
such equality is preserved.<p>

<i>Virtues annexed to justice.</i><p>

Since justice is relative to another, all virtues which imply such 
relation may be connected with it; yet they may fall short of the 
perfect idea of virtue as it is found in the chief virtue of this 
class, which is justice, the giving to others what is due and the full 
equivalent of what is due. Other virtues may give what is due without 
giving all that is due. (1) First, all that man can render to God is 
due, but he cannot render as much as he ought. Religion, then, is a 
virtue annexed to justice. <p>

(2) Parents cannot be recompensed fully for what they have done. Filial 
piety is an imperfect form of justice. <p>

(3) Man cannot recompense virtue as it deserves. Outward respect and 
honour (<i>"observantia"</i>) is an imperfect form of justice. 
<!--
326 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. LXXXI. 1, 2.  
--><A NAME="p326"></a><p>

But virtues annexed to justice may fall short of it, also, as regards 
the idea of what is due. Morally due is what one owes according to the 
propriety of virtue. It may he so necessary that without it an 
honourable life cannot be preserved. On the part of the one who owes 
this obligation, the duty is that he show himself in words and deeds 
such as he is in reality. (4) Truthfulness is annexed to justice. <p>

Or, on the part of the one to whom the debt is due, one recompenses 
another for the kindness which he has shown, (5) by gratitude in word 
and deed. Or, (6) in the case of ill which has been done (of course, 
with those due motives which have been heretofore pointed out), proper 
vengeance is a virtue annexed to justice. <p>

But this debt of virtue, which ought to be paid, may contribute to an 
honourable life without being essential to it. Such virtues are (7) 
liberality, affability, and the like, in which the idea of debt almost 
vanishes.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Religion.</h4><p>

<i>What is religion?</i><p>

It is a virtue by which man renders to his God due homage, worship, 
honour, and reverence. Giving any one his due is a virtuous act, and if 
it proceed from a corresponding habit, marks a virtuous man. 
Manifestly, then, the definition of virtue heretofore given applies to 
religion. <p>

(1) What S. James says (i. 27) does not conflict with this. For 
religion produces acts of two kinds; some are its proper and immediate 
acts elicited by it, through which man is ordered with respect to God 
only, as sacrifice, adoration, and the like; but it has other acts 
which it produces through the virtues which it directs as means to its 
end, which end is homage to Almighty God. Such acts are "visiting the 
fatherless and the widows in their affliction," acts elicited by mercy, 
and "keeping self unspotted from the world," an act commanded by 
religion, but elicited by temperance or some such virtue. 
<!--
Qu. LXXXI. 3, 4, 5.] RELIGION. 327  
--><A NAME="p327"></a><p>

(2) We owe one another service in the Church of God (Gal. v. 13), but 
God's dominion and right is infinitely exalted, and the service which 
is due to Him (<i>"latria"</i>) is preeminent and distinct from any 
other. <p>

(3) Men may have a claim to marks of honour ("with my body I thee 
<i>worship</i>"), but the honour due to God is special and distinct, 
<i>"Eusebeia"</i> or <i>"Theosebeia."</i>  <p>

<i>This virtue gives reverence to one God as the Creator, Governor, Father 
of all men.</i><p>

It has various outward acts, but they are all reducible to those Divine 
honours which are paid from reverence for His infinite excellence, or 
that service which is due from God's subject creatures; but these two 
are the one act of reverential homage. <p>

Religion is a special virtue, because of the special good for which it 
is ordained; viz., paying due and peculiar honour to God. <p>

Every virtuous act is a sacrifice, so far as it is ordained for 
reverential homage to God. But so it is commanded by the special virtue 
of religion. All things, says the apostle (1 Cor. x. 31), are to be 
done to the "glory of God." But the same remark applies; such acts are 
religious, not religion, because they pertain to it, not as elicited, 
but as commanded by that reverential homage which is religion.  <p>

<i>Is religion a theological virtue?</i><p>

Worship of God springing from reverential homage is a dictate of 
natural reason; it is natural religion. What positive Divine or human 
law has done is merely to determine it in this way or that way. (This 
fact itself shows that religion is not a theological virtue; but the 
author thoroughly examines the ground of denial.) Theological virtues 
have God for their direct object. He is the object of faith, of hope, 
of love. But He is the end of religious acts, not their direct object 
or "matter;" their matter is worship; for 
<!--
328 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. LXXXI. 6, 7. 
--><A NAME="p328"></a>
 due worship is offered -- say, sacrificial offerings -- out of 
reverence for God. <p>

"By faith, hope, and charity" (S. Aug., Enchir. 3) which have God as 
their proper object, God is worshipped, because they command acts of 
religion as things ordained to the end of those virtues. <p>

Religion, as we have seen, is a part of the moral virtue of justice.  <p>

<i>Religion is preeminent among the moral virtues,</i> <p>

because, while all those virtues have God for their end, it comes 
nearer to that end than the others do, producing what is directly and 
immediately ordained for the Divine honour. <p>

(1) The praise of virtue consists in the good will, not in the power of 
doing much. Religion cannot pay all that is due, but that is no 
derogation from the supreme rank of this moral virtue. <p>

(2) God, it is true, needs nothing from us; but it is in those things 
which are bestowed on others for their benefit that gifts to the more 
needy are the more laudable, because they are more useful. But nothing 
is offered to God for His benefit, but for His glory and our own good.  <p>

<i>Does religion require outward acts?</i><p>

We offer reverence and honour to God, not on His account, since we can 
add nothing to His glory, but on our own account. The perfection of our 
own soul is found in this subjection. But the human soul needs, in 
order that it may be united to God, the guidance and assistance of 
sensible things. Therefore in Divine worship it is necessary to employ 
outward, bodily acts, in order that by them, as by signs of the inward 
act, the soul may be lifted up in its spiritual acts by which it is 
joined to God. Therefore religion has inward acts as chief, and as, 
<i>per se</i>, its 
<!--
Qu. LXXXII. 1, 2.] DEVOTION AND PRAYER. 329 
--><A NAME="p329"></a>
 own; but outward acts as secondary and ordained for the other. <p>

Therefore Christ said (S. John iv. 24), "God is a spirit, and they that 
worship Him must worship in spirit and truth." <p>

The outward corporal acts may be similar to those which are presented 
out of respect to men (bowing or kneeling, etc.), but they are only 
needful signs of inward and spiritual actions.  <p>

<i>Is religion the same as the virtue of holiness?</i><p>

Holiness is attributed to those things which are applied to Divine 
worship, so that not only men but churches and sacred vessels are said 
to be sanctified by being so applied. Now, inward purification is 
necessary in order that the mind may be elevated to God, because the 
soul is defiled by cleaving to lower things; sanctity is that virtue 
"without which no man shall see the Lord" (Heb. xii. 14). Since, then, 
holiness is that by which the mind of man directs itself and its 
actions to God, it does not differ from religion in essence but only in 
our conception of it. For religion offers to God due service in that 
which pertains to Divine worship, as sacrifices, oblations, and the 
like; but holiness refers to God not only these but the acts of the 
other virtues, or fits man for Divine worship.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. Devotion and prayer.</h4><p>

<i>Devotion is a special act of religion, being the act of a will prepared 
to do promptly what belongs to the service of God.</i><p>

It is the same virtue which does the thing and has the prompt will to 
do it. Charity is the root from which spring both religion and 
devotion. It is meditation on the Divine bounty and benefits and the 
cousideration of our own needs which is a special cause of devotion. 
<!--
330 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. LXXXIII. 1-3.  
--><A NAME="p330"></a><p>

<i>Prayer is an act of reason moved by a loving will, in which God is 
asked for what is fitting for Him to grant.</i><p>

It tends to the end of charity, which is to be united with God, both 
because this is the chief object of prayer (Ps. xxvii. 4), and because 
he that makes any petition must approach him of whom he asks it. 
Prayer, then, implies an uplifting of the soul to God.  <p>

<i>Is prayer a proper act of religion?</i><p>

That it is an act of religion is evident, for it pertains to that to 
offer reverence and honour to God, and all things by which such 
reverence is manifested belong to religion. But in prayer such 
reverence is manifested in subjection and acknowledgment that God is 
the author of all good for the supply of human need. All good desires 
fall under the precept of charity, but the asking under the precept of 
religion. "Ask, and it shall be given you" (S. Matt. vii. 7). In 
asking, the soul, subjecting itself, makes oblation of itself, which is 
far above all outward and corporal oblations and sacrifices. <p>

And prayer is fitting, notwithstanding the three-fold error of ancient 
and modern heathen: (1) It is vain to pray if human affairs are not 
ruled by Divine Providence; (2) prayer is useless if some physical 
necessity control all events; (3) prayer is superstition if it suppose 
that Divine Providence is variable, and that God's good will can be 
changed. (Note the familiar but profane objection of the day.) <p>

In maintaining the usefulness of prayer, we neither impose necessity on 
human affairs subjected to Divine Providence, nor deem the Divine good 
pleasure to be mutable. Divine Providence not only orders effects, but 
also from what causes and in what order they shall come. But among 
those causes are human acts; and men must do certain things, not that 
they may change the Divine will, but that by their acts they may fulfil 
the order appointed by God for 
<!--
Qu. LXXXIII. 5.] DEVOTION AND PRAYER. 331
--><A NAME="p331"></a>
 the accomplishment of certain results. We do not pray in order that we 
may change our Father, but in order to ask what God has arranged to be 
fulfilled through prayer. "Men by asking merit to receive what God 
arranged to give before the world was made" (S. Greg.). <p>

(1) We do not pray that we may inform God of what we need: "Your 
heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things" (S. 
Matt. vi. 32); but we pray in order that we ourselves may consider 
that in our needs we are to seek Divine aid. <p>

(2) God, unasked, wills to give us many things from His own boundless 
liberality; but that he wills to give us some things when we ask, is 
for our own benefit; <i>sc.</i>, that we may go to our Father with 
confidence, and that we may recognize Him to be the author of all good.  <p>

<i>In prayer ought we to make any special petition?</i><p>

There are things which a man can use well or ill, which may prove 
mischievous for himself; but there are also good things which a man 
cannot use so, and these are asked for absolutely. <p>

(1) It is true that "we know not how to pray as we ought" (Rom. viii. 
26); but it is also true that the "Spirit helpeth our infirmity," 
inspiring us with holy desires, that we may rightly ask. <p>

(2) In making determined petitions one may seem to be trying to incline 
another's will towards his own, whereas our aim should be, not that God 
should will what we will, but rather that we should will what He wills. 
But in asking what pertains to our salvation (however special the 
petition maybe), we do conform our will to His who "willeth that all 
men should be saved" (1 Tim. ii. 4). <p>

And, finally, our Lord Himself taught His disciples, in the "Lord's 
Prayer," to make determined and special petitions. 
<!--
332 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. LXXXIII. 6, 7.  
--><A NAME="p332"></a><p>

<i>Ought man in his prayer to ask for earthly things?</i><p>

Agar said (Prov. xxx. 8), "Feed me with the food that is needful for 
me;" and S. Augustine says (Ep. ad Prob. 130), "It is lawful to pray 
for that which it is lawful to desire." But temporal things may be 
lawfully desired, not indeed as an end, but as means to an end, by 
which we are aided in seeking beatitude, since by them the corporal 
life is sustained and they can serve the acts of virtue. <p>

(1) The Lord said (S. Matt. vi. 33), "Seek ye first the kingdom of God 
and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you." 
They cannot lawfully hold the chief place, but are to have a subsidiary 
one; the true riches are to be sought as our chief good; these as 
needful for our earthly life. <p>

(2) Not all care for such things is prohibited (S. Matt. vi. 25), but 
inordinate anxiety. <p>

(3) When the soul seeks earthly goods as its rest, it is lowered to 
their level; but when it prays for them in their relation to its 
beatitude, it is uplifted to that and to God. <p>

(4) They are not asked for unconditionally, but in relation to 
something else; that is, as they are expedient for our salvation.  <p>

<i>Intercession is a form of prayer; we ought to pray for others.</i><p>

For charity requires that we desire others' good (S. Jas. v. 16); and 
what we ought to desire we ought to pray for. <p>

We do not say, "My Father," but "Our Father;" nor do we say, "Give 
me," but "Give us." " The Lord of unity was unwilling that each should 
merely pray separately for himself. He willed that one should pray for 
all, since in His one Person He bore the burden of all" (S. Cyprian., 
De Orat. Domin.). <p>

Prayer for another may not always be granted, even when it is faithful 
and persevering and for things pertaining to salvation, because of 
obstacles which that other puts in the 
<!--
Qu. LXXXIII. 8.] DEVOTION AND PRAYER. 333 
--><A NAME="p333"></a>
 way of an answer; but nevertheless such prayer, springing from 
charity, is meritorious like any other work of charity. <p>

Prayer is to be made for the just, that they may persevere and go 
forward; for sinners, that they may turn and be saved (1 Ep. S. John v. 
16). We know not who the reprobate are, therefore prayer is to be made 
for all sinners (1 Tim. ii. 1).  <p>

<i>We ought to pray for our enemies (S. Matt. v. 44).</i><p>

Prayer for others is a work of charity; as, therefore, we are bound to 
love our enemies, so are we bound to pray for them. But how we are 
bound to love our enemies has been already considered (see page 200). 
We are to love their nature, not their sin. We are not commanded to 
give them special love, except in the preparation of a soul ready to 
love an enemy with special love and to help him in necessity or if he 
ask pardon. More than this is love's perfection, not its indispensable 
obligation. The like obligation applies to our prayers; enemies are not 
to he excluded. But that we pray specially for them, when not in 
necessity or other peculiar circumstances, is a work of. perfection, 
not of absolute obligation. <p>

(1) Holy Scriptures, indeed, contain many imprecations against enemies, 
as in Psalm Xl. 14, and many others. But these imprecations are to be 
understood, first, as prophetic denunciations; secondly, as temporal 
chastisements for the correction of sinners; next, as directed against 
the kingdom of sin, not against particular sinners, that by the 
correction of men sins may be destroyed; and, lastly, as conforming the 
will of man to Divine justice. (We may add that Christians speak the 
Psalms in the name of their Lord against His enemies.) <p>

So the martyred saints beneath the altar in heaven say, "How long, O 
Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them 
that dwell on the earth?" (Rev. 
<!--
334 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. LXXXIII. 12.  
--><A NAME="p334"></a>
 vi. 10). But they pray for the overthrow of the kingdom of sin and 
rejoice at the work of Divine justice. <p>

(2) It may be said that men's prayers should not contradict their 
actions, and it is lawful to fight against enemies, for wars are 
sometimes lawful. But the object of just war is to put down evil, and 
this brings good to enemies as well as to others. So prayer and action 
need not contradict one another.  <p>

<i>Should prayer be vocal?</i><p>

Prayer is either private or public, <i>i.e.</i>, the prayer of the 
faithful people of God offered for them by the ministers of the Church. 
This should be known by all the people for whom it is offered, which 
cannot be if it is not vocal. So the Church orders respecting it. <p>

But the private prayer of an individual for himself or for others need 
not be vocal. Yet the voice is added to such prayer for three reasons; 
first, outward signs of devotion, such as spoken words are, may excite 
the inward devotion by which the soul is uplifted to God. But if the 
soul be distracted by these outward signs, whatever they may be, or be 
hindered in any manner, they are to be discontinued; and this is 
especially true of those who are sufficiently prepared for devotion 
without these outward signs of it. <p>

Secondly, vocal prayer is added to inward prayer as paying what is due; 
<i>sc.</i>, that man serve God with all that he has from God -- 
<i>i.e.</i>, not only with his mind but with his body (Hos. xiv. 2). <p>

Thirdly, the warm affections of the soul break forth in audible language. <p>

Vocal prayer is not uttered to inform God of what He is ignorant, but 
to raise the mind to God. It is not wrong to be "seen of men" (S. Matt. 
vi. 6), but to pray outwardly in order that we may be seen of men. 
<!--
Qu. LXXXIII. 18.] PRAYER. 335  
--><A NAME="p335"></a><p>

<i>Must prayer be with fixed attention?</i><p>

This question chiefly concerns vocal prayer. If we speak of necessity 
in this matter, it signifies either that by which the end is better 
reached, or that without which the end is not reached at all. For the 
first, attention (undistracted) is absolutely necessary. But there are 
three effects of prayer. The first, which is merit, is common to all 
acts which are "informed" by charity. And for this effect it is not 
necessarily required that there be fixed attention throughout the 
prayer, but the first actual attention with which one began his prayer 
renders the whole efficacious in this way (this is virtual attention; 
one began with hearty desire to pray, but was unwillingly distracted). 
The second effect of prayer is peculiar to it; viz., the obtaining a 
petition; and the first intention, which God chiefly regards, suffices 
for this effect also. But if the first intention to pray is absent, 
there is merely the empty form of outward prayer; it is neither 
meritorious, nor does it obtain any answer from God. <p>

The third effect of prayer which it directly produces is a spiritual 
refreshment of the soul; and for this actual attention is necessary. <p>

The sense of the words may be attended to, or the mind may be fixed on 
God and the thing prayed for; and this latter is in the highest degree 
necessary. <p>

(1) They that worship God "must worship Him in spirit and in truth" (S. 
John iv. 24). But they do this who begin their prayer from the 
prompting of the Holy Spirit, even if, through infirmity, their mind 
afterwards wander. <p>

(2) Through infirmity of nature, the mind cannot long be lifted up on 
high; its own heavy load drags it down. <p>

(3) If any one purposely wander in mind during prayer he mocks God; he 
sins, and loses the fruit of prayer. But unintentional distractions do 
not take away the first and second fruits of prayer.
<!--
336 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. LXXXIII. 14.  
--><A NAME="p336"></a><p>

<i>Continual prayer.</i><p>

The Lord said, "Men ought always to pray, and not to faint" (S. Luke 
xviii. 1); and S. Paul said, "Pray without ceasing" (1 Thess. v. 17). 
The cause of prayer is the desire which springs from charity, which 
desire ought to be continually in us, either actually or virtually, for 
this desire virtually abides in all things which we do from the motive 
of charity. But we ought to do all things to the glory of God (1 Cor. 
X. 31). In this way we ought always to pray. <p>

But prayer considered in itself cannot be continual, for there are 
other duties in life; "therefore, at certain intervals of time we call 
upon God in words also, that by those signs of inward devotion we may 
admonish ourselves, discover how far we have advanced in that desire, 
and excite ourselves more zealously to increase it" (S. Aug., ad 
Probam, Ep. 130). But the quantity of a thing should be proportioned to 
the end. Prayer, then, should last as long as it is useful to excite 
the fervour of inward desire. But when it exceeds this measure, so that 
it cannot last without weariness, it should not be protracted. This 
principle applies also to public and common prayer as compared with the 
devotion of the people. (Well worthy, I think, to he noted.) <p>

(1) Christ said that the heathen "think that they shall be heard for 
their much speaking" (S. Matt. vi. 7). But "it is not much speaking to 
pray a long time. For much speech is one thing, enduring affection is 
another. The Lord Himself continued all night in prayer, giving us an 
example of protracted devotion. Much speaking is using superfluous 
words; but much praying is entreating Him to whom we pray with long 
and devout uplifting of the soul" (S. Aug., loc. cit.). <p>

(2) The Lord did not give His prayer as the only form, but to show us 
what things we are to desire and ask for. <p>

To pray without ceasing is to persevere in the appointed 
<!--
Qu. LXXXIII. 154 PRAYER. 337 
--><A NAME="p154"></a>
 times for vocal prayer, and to have fts effects remaining in a more 
devout soul.  <p>

<i>Is prayer a meritorious work?</i><p>

It is so inasmuch as it proceeds from the root of charity, whose proper 
object is eternal good, for whose fruition charity fits us. Prayer 
comes from charity through religion, whose act is prayer, along with 
other virtues which are requisite for a good prayer; viz., humility and 
faith. Religion offers the prayer, charity gives the desire of what is 
prayed for. Faith is necessary, for we must believe that we shall 
obtain what we ask for. Humility is necessary, for we must recognize 
our need. But prayer is efficacious from the grace of God, who also 
leads us to pray. <p>

(1) But does not prayer precede grace, since the Lord says (S. Luke xi. 
13), "Your heavenly Father will give the Holy Spirit to them that ask 
Him"? Yes; but prayer without justifying grace is not meritorious; 
neither is any other virtuous act. And yet the prayer which asks for 
this grace proceeds from some grace, sin so that very prayer is the 
gift of God. <p>

(2) But if prayer is meritorious at all, it seems to merit to be heard. 
But oftentimes it is not heard, as we notice in S. Paul's case. I 
answer that the merit of prayer may apply to a different thing from 
that which is asked for. For merit is chiefly the fitness for 
beatitude, but many other things are prayed for. If, then, that thing 
which is asked for is not serviceable for that beatitude, it is not 
merited. Sometimes it is neither necessary to salvation nor manifestly 
contrary to it; and then, though the prayer may merit eternal life, it 
does not merit to obtain the petition. "Mercifully it may be heard, and 
mercifully it may be rejected. What is useful for the sick man, the 
physician knows better than he" (S. Aug.). S. Paul was not heard, 
because it was not expedient that he should he heard. But if that 
which is asked for pertain to the soul's life, 
<!--
338 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. LXXXIV. 1. 
--><A NAME="p338"></a>
 it is merited not only by prayer but by other works of charity. 
Undoubtedly the petition is granted, but at a fitting time, which 
granting can be hindered if one does not persevere in prayer. <p>

But since man cannot merit eternal life by his worthiness, nor be 
worthy of the things which pertain to eternal life, he is not always 
heard in praying for another. There are then four conditions, which 
concurring, one always obtains his petition -- <i>sc.</i>, that he ask 
for himself, what is necessary to salvation, devoutly (<i>i.e.</i>, 
with faith, hope, Love, humility, and attention) and perseveringly.  <p>

<i>Do sinners ever obtain anything from God by prayer?</i><p>

The publican in the Gospel did not say in vain, "God be merciful to me 
a sinner." For two things are to he considered in the sinner, his 
nature which God loves, and the sin which God hates. If, then, he ask 
anything as a sinner -- <i>i.e.</i>, according to sinful desire -- he 
is not heard in mercy, though sometimes he is heard for vengeance, when 
he is allowed to rush still further into sins. But God, out of pure 
mercy, hears the prayer of the sinner proceeding from such good desires 
as may remain in him, provided that the four conditions above mentioned 
be found in that prayer.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. Outward acts of Divine worship: Adoration, sacrifices, 
and oblations.</h4><p>

"Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God" (S. Matt. iv. 10). <p>

Adoration is reverential homage, an act of religion due to God 
preeminently on account of His infinite excellence, in which other 
beings can only participate at infinite distance. Outward signs of 
inward reverence are due to superiors, but sacrifice can be offered to 
God only. King David lawfully accepted such "worship" from Nathan the 
prophet (1 Kings i. 23), but the angel of the Apocalypse 
<!--
Qu. LXXXV. 1.] OUTWARD ACTS OF WORSHIP 330 
--><A NAME="p330"></a>
 refused it from S. John (Rev. xxii. 8), excluding occasion for 
idolatry.  <p>

<i>Does adoration imply a corporeal act?</i><p>

Because we are of two-fold nature, we offer to God a twofold adoration: 
the spiritual homage of inward devotion, and the outward, of lowly 
bodily abasement before Him. The latter is for the former; viz., that 
by outward signs of humility our inward affections may be the more 
subjected to God. <p>

This is "worship in spirit," if it proceed from Spiritual devotion, and 
has that for its end.  <p>

<i>Corporeal adoration implies a determined place where it is offered to 
God.</i><p>

Inward devotion apprehends God as not limited to any place. But the 
bended knee in sign of human weakness, or prostration in sign of our 
nothingness in the sight of God, requires a determined place. <p>

A place is Consecrated for the use of man, not on God's account. It is 
for the adoring worshipper, first, that he may be the more devout; 
next, because of the sacred objects, sacramental and other, which are 
there contained; and lastly, because of the promise, "Where two or 
three are gathered in My name, there am I in the midst of them."  <p>

<i>Sacrifice. -- Is offering sacrifice a part of the law of nature?</i><p>

Natural reason indicates to man his dependence on another, because of 
the defects which he feels in himself, in which he needs to be aided 
and directed by another. That other is what all name God. And natural 
reason also dictates to man that he, after his manner, exhibit honour 
and subjection to what is above him. But the fitting manner is for him 
to use sensible signs. Therefore it is from natural reason that man 
employs sensible things, offering them to God in sign of due honour and 
subjection. 
<!--
340 RELIGION AND OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. LXXXV. 2, 3.  
--><A NAME="p340"></a>
But this is sacrifice. Therefore the offering of sacrifice is part of 
the law of nature. <p>

Men differ widely in what they offer. But there are some things which 
in their general principle are part of the law of nature, while their 
particular application depends upon positive law. Thus it is a law of 
nature that malefactors be punished; but the kind of punishment depends 
upon positive law, human or Divine. So, also, sacrifice in general is a 
law of nature, but its determination belongs to human or Divine 
institution.  <p>

<i>Sacrifice is to be offered to God only.</i><p>

For it is offered as a sacred symbol. What is outwardly offered 
signifies the inward spiritual sacrifice, in which the soul offers 
itself to God ("The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit," Ps. li. 19), 
for outward acts of religion are ordained for the inward acts. But the 
soul offers itself for a sacrifice to God as its Creator, and the only 
source of its beatitude. Therefore, as we are to offer to God alone the 
spiritual sacrifice, so we ought to offer to Him alone its outward 
symbol.  <p>

<i>The offering of sacrifice is a special act of religion.</i><p>

It is praiseworthy only as done out of reverence for God. Other 
virtuous acts may be intended for the same end, as giving alms, or 
patiently enduring affliction, but sacrificial acts are for this end 
alone. Man's good is three-fold, and each may be offered to God, and in 
a general way is then called a sacrifice. First, there is the good of 
the soul, which is offered to God in the inward sacrifice of devotion 
and prayer. This is the principal sacrifice. But next there is the good 
of man's body, which is offered to God in martyrdom, abstinence, 
continence. And it is said (Rom. xii. 1), "Present your bodies a living 
sacrifice." And, third, there is the good of external things, which are 
directly a sacrifice when we offer them to God, and they are indi<!--
Qu. LXXXVI. 1.] OUTWARD ACTS OF WORSHIP 341  
 --><A NAME="p341"></a>rectly a sacrifice when we communicate them for God's sake. "With 
such sacrifices God is well pleased" (Heb. xiii. 16). <p>

Every sacrifice is an oblation, an offering to God; but not every 
oblation is a sacrifice, because the latter signifies also that some 
religious change is made in the oblation; thus, animals were killed and 
burned, and bread is blessed, broken, and eaten. First fruits are 
oblations because they are offered; they are not sacrifices, properly 
speaking, because no further action follows.  <p>

<i>Are all bound to offer sacrifice?</i><p>

What is the law of nature obliges all, and this is part of the law of 
nature; therefore all are bound in some way to offer sacrifice. All owe 
the inward sacrifice of presenting to God a devout and humble spirit. 
But the outward sacrifice, as we have just seen, is of two kinds; one 
which is laudable only because some outward thing is offered in token 
of subjection to God. Those who are under revealed law, whether the Old 
Law or the new Gospel law, are bound to offer certain sacrifices 
according to the commandment given to them. But those who were not 
under the law revealed, were bound to do certain outward things for the 
Divine honour, according to the fitting customs of their place and 
nation. <p>

The other outward sacrifice is when outward acts of other virtues are 
undertaken as marks of homage to God, and some of these are bound upon 
all. <p>

Priests, indeed, offer those sacrifices which are especially instituted 
for Divine worship, not only for themselves but also for others; but 
there are other sacrifices which each one can offer for himself.  <p>

<i>Oblations.  -- As a general term the word applies to all things 
which are offered in Divine worship.</i> <p>

If the offering is converted into a sacred thing, at that 
<!--
342 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. LXXXVIII. 1. 
--><A NAME="p342"></a>
 time to be consumed, it is both sacrifice and oblation. But if it 
remain to be employed in Divine worship, or for the use of the 
ministers of the sanctuary, it is an oblation and not a sacrifice. Such 
offerings must be voluntary; but they may also be obligatory, as Church 
rates, or subscriptions and gifts bequeathed to the Church, or 
offerings for the support of the clergy, etc. <p>

Gifts to the poor are not, strictly speaking, oblations unless they are 
first offered to God through the priest (Heb. v. 1). <p>

These oblations may be consecrated and set apart, as sacred vessels and 
vestments are, for the service of God. Then they cannot be turned to 
common uses; but otherwise they may be dispensed by the clergy. (See 
the Offertory rubric.)  <p>

<i>The command (Prov. iii. 9), "Honour the Lord with thy substance," 
applies to all things justly possessed.</i><p>

Things unjustly acquired and possessed cannot be made an oblation to 
God. Accidentally, even that which is lawfully possessed cannot he so 
used; say, if doing so tend to the injury of another, as a son's 
offering what his father needs, or any offering which causes scandal, 
etc. <p>

The imposing of tithes, while it rests on the law of nature, belongs to 
the positive law of the Church, which has authority in this regard. 
(But the subject is here omitted as not directly applicable to our 
circumstances.)  <p>

<h4>&sect; 5. Vows.</h4><p>

<i>A vow implies a certain obligation to do or leave undone 
anything.</i><p>

Obligation between man and man is created by a promise, a rational 
promise, made through outward signs of it, as spoken or written words. 
But a promise may be made to God in the thoughts of the heart, although 
the 
<!--
Qu. Lxxxviii. 2.] VOWS. 343  
--><A NAME="p343"></a>
 outward signs of it may stir one up to its fulfilment, or call others 
to witness it. <p>

But a true promise proceeds from the deliberate purpose of a will which 
intends to bind itself. So, then, a vow requires three things first, 
deliberation; next, purpose of the will; and thirdly, a promise, to 
which may be superadded the words of the lips and the witness of other 
men.  <p>

The Divine law of vows is given in Deut. xxiii. 21 "When thou shalt vow 
a vow unto the Lord thy God, a free-will offering which thou hast 
promised with thy mouth, thou shalt not be slack to pay it; for the 
Lord thy God will surely require it of thee; and it would be sin in 
thee. But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee." It 
would be a vain promise if any one should promise that which would not 
be accepted. Therefore nothing illicit, nothing indifferent, may be 
made the subject of a vow, but only some act of virtue. But because a 
vow implies a voluntary promise, nothing which is absolutely necessary 
to be or not to be can be the subject of a vow. <p>

But that which is not absolutely necessary, but is so only on account 
of the end sought for, as that which is necessary for salvation, may be 
vowed because it is voluntary. But that virtuous act which is not 
necessary to salvation is altogether voluntary, and is most peculiarly 
the subject of a vow. It is some greater good which is vowed. <p>

(1) The vow of baptism (renewed in confirmation) is voluntary; so far 
it justly takes the name of a vow; but it is not a vow in the narrower 
sense just explained. <p>

(2) Jephtha's vow, in itself considered, had a good object, but an 
unlooked-for event made it evil, and it was not to be observed, for 
what is evil cannot be the subject of a vow. <p>

(3) Ascetic practices like vigils and fasting are acceptable only as 
they are virtuous, which is when they are adopted 
<!--
344 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. Lxxxviii. 8, 4. 
--><A NAME="p344"></a>
 with due judgment to restrain concupiscence without injuring the body. 
So far they may be vowed. So the apostle (Rom. xii. 1), after he had 
said, "Present your bodies," etc., added, "which is your reasonable 
service." Such vows are better observed or set aside under advice of 
superiors; but if it cannot be had, and great and manifest injury is 
felt, one ought not to keep such a vow. (This is not omitted, though 
there is reason to suspect that it is little applicable to a luxurious 
and easy-going age.) But vows which are made respecting vain and 
useless things are rather to be laughed at than observed.  <p>

<i>Every vow, when made, is obligatory.</i><p>

"Pay that which thou vowest. Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, 
than that thou shouldest vow and not pay," is God's law (Eceles. v. 4). 
Man owes the highest fidelity to God, both because of His Lordship, and 
because of benefits received. And keeping vows is a part of that 
fidelity. <p>

Objection may be made that man needs what we may promise, while God 
needs nothing from us; and yet a mere promise made to another is not 
obligatory in law, because it only expresses a purpose which may 
change. Much less, then, does a simple promise of what is not 
obligatory before God bind a man's conscience. <p>

But in conscience a man is bound by his promise to another man, 
according to the law of nature; although, for expediency's sake, other 
conditions are required by civil law. And although God needs not our 
good things, our highest obligation is to Him. <p>

If any one has vowed that which proves impossible to be fulfilled, he 
ought to do what in him lies towards its fulfilment, as having a ready 
will.  <p>

<i>Is it expedient to vow anything?</i><p>

Holy Scripture says (Ps. lxxvi. 11), "Vow, and pay unto 
<!--
Qu. LXXXVIII. 5.] Vows. 345
--><A NAME="p345"></a>
 the Lord your God." A promise made to God is not for His benefit, but 
for our own. And by our vow we fix our will immovably on that which it 
is expedient to do. Therefore it is expedient to vow. (Per contra, 
Luther, De Libertate Christiana.) <p>

(1) This does not conflict with Christian liberty; for as the not being 
able to sin does not diminish liberty, so the necessity of a will fixed 
on good does not detract from liberty. Such is the necessity of a vow
 -- "happy necessity which compels to better things" (S. Aug., Ep. 127, 
ad Arment. et Paulin.). <p>

(2) Some one may say that there is risk of breaking the vow, and one 
ought not to incur such risk. But when the danger springs from any 
action itself, then that action is not expedient, as the crossing a 
river on a very rotten plank. But if the risk is in a man's ceasing 
from that action, then the deed on that account does not cease to be 
expedient, as it may be expedient to mount a horse, although there is a 
possibility of getting a fall in consequence thereof. Otherwise it 
would be necessary to cease from all good actions; because they may 
possibly have some risk connected with them. But the danger to him who 
vows lawfully is not from the vow, but from his fault in changing his 
mind and transgressing his vow.  A vow is an act of worship or 
religion. <p>

Every virtuous act umy be made an act of religion by being offered to 
God, by being ordained to the service of God. And a vow is a promise 
made to God, an ordaining of that which is promised for Him to whom the 
promise is made. For example, fasting or continence may be virtuous 
acts, but when any such thing is promised to God, it becomes aa act of 
religion, like prayer or offering sacrifice. The promise may be made to 
man, also, as to the bishop in ordination, but the vow is made to God 
alone. 
<!--
346 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. Lxxxviii. 8.
--><A NAME="p346">
<i>It may be more laudable to do some virtuous act with a vow than 
without a vow.</i> <p>

There are three reasons for this: (1) First, to vow is an act of 
Divine worship, and the act of the lower virtue is better and more 
meritorious when it is commanded by the higher virtue, as the act of 
faith or hope is better if it proceed from charity. The act of 
abstinence, or whatever it be, becomes a kind of sacrifice to God. <p>

(2) Secondly, he who vows and does anything, more fully subjects 
himself to God than by the simple act of doing it, because he binds 
himself to do nothing different from what he has promised. <p>

(3) Lastly, by the vow his will is more immovably fixed towards the 
good, not only with respect to one particular act but for all the 
future.  <p>

<i>We may distinguish solemn vows from simple vows,</i><p>

because the former are accompanied by some spiritual benediction or 
consecration, as in the case of Holy Orders, or the entering some 
religious order, or, in a different way, in the nuptial benediction. <p>

This is not merely the question of public celebration, a sort of human 
solemnity; it is a spiritual and Divine solemnity, no matter how few 
are present at it, because God is the bestower of the spiritual 
benediction or consecration, although man is the minister of it (Num. 
vi. 27).  <p>

<i>May those who are under the power of others be hindered from taking 
a vow?</i><p>

No one can by promise bind himself to that which is in another's power. 
But whoever is subject to another, has no authority to do what he will 
in that respect wherein he is subject. Therefore he cannot bind himself 
in those things without his superior's consent (Num. xxx. 3). <p>

It may seem that the obligation by which any one is subjected to man is 
less than that of a vow made to God.  
<!--
Qu. LXXXVIII. 10.] VOWS. 347 
--><A NAME="p347"></a>
 But the promise made to Him must be virtuous, and it is contrary to 
virtue that man offer to God what is another's. It is not a true vow at 
all, except under the condition that he who has authority in the matter 
make no objection. (Thus parents can annul the vows of their children 
until they come of age. But see, further, Supplement on Holy Matrimony, 
<a href="emt30.htm#sect3">chap. xi. &sect; 3</a>.)  <p>

<i>The Church has power of dispensation.</i><p>

Dispensation from vows is like the release from keeping some law which, 
though made for the general good, may prove in some special case to be 
not good, and the law-making power may dispense with the observance of 
the law in that case. <p>

So in the case of a vow made for what is in itself and in general good, 
it may happen that the thing vowed proves to be evil in that particular 
ease, or useless, or a hindrance to some greater good, which is 
contrary to the very idea of a vow. Therefore it is necessary that some 
authority in such a case determine that the vow is not to be kept. This 
is dispensation. <p>

(1) In the case of human law, it is not decreed that the law should not 
be obeyed, which would he contrary to the law of nature and to Divine 
command, but that the law does not apply to the ease in question. So, 
also, the authority of a superior may determine that what was vowed is 
not suitable matter for a vow. The bishop, in such a case, does not 
dispense with natural or Divine law, but he determines that which could 
not be fully foreseen in advance. <p>

(2) Such a dispensation is not contrary to the fidelity which is due to 
God, because such fidelity does not imply that man, having ignorantly 
vowed, shall do what is evil, useless, or a hindrance of greater good. <p>

A bishop cannot annul a solemn consecration, so that that which is 
solemnly blessed and vowed to God loses its sanctification. Holy Orders 
cannot be so annulled. But 
<!--
348 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. LXXXIX. 1,2. 
--><A NAME="p348"></a>
 for cause the bishop may inhibit the fulfilling of the vow of 
Orders; <i>i.e.</i>, deprive of the right to execute its functions.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 6. On oaths.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup></h4><p>

<i>Human testimony is requisite in particular contingent facts which 
cannot be directly and infallilby known by demonstrative proof.</i> <p>

But this testimony is deficient through lack of veracity in the 
witness, and defective knowledge of the future, of the secrets of the 
heart, etc. Now, in the oath God is called to witness, He who cannot 
lie nor be deceived. <p>

This testimony may be of the past or the present; it is then an 
<i>assertory</i> oath, as in courts of law. It may be intended to 
confirm the future; it is then a promissory oath, as the oath at 
taking office. In quoting Holy Scripture the testimony already given by 
God is used; but in the oath He is implored to give testimony, to 
manifest the truth, as by punishing the liar (<i>imprecatory oath</i>).<p>

<i>Are oaths lawful?</i><p>

Holy Scripture says, "Thou shalt swear by His Name" (Deut. vi. 13). A 
thing may be in itself good, and yet turn to evil in his case who uses 
it ill. And the oath is in itself lawful and good, as will appear both 
from its origin and from its end. The oath is introduced because men 
believe that God has infallible veracity and universal foresight and 
knowledge of all things. Its end is to justify men, and put a stop to 
controversies. "The oath is final for confirmation" (Heb. vi. 16). But 
it may be turned to ill, in being used without need and without due 
caution. For he seems to have little reverence for God who invokes His 
attestation in a trifling 
<!--
Qu. LXXXIX. 3, 4, 5.] ON OATHS. 349 
--><A NAME="p349"></a>
 cause, and such as he would hardly venture to call a man of standing 
to witness. Besides, there is great danger of perjury in such cases. <p>

The Lord said, "Swear not at all" (S. Matt. v. 34); but the example of 
S. Paul shows us how those words are to be understood; viz., that we 
avoid forming the evil habit of swearing lightly and on trivial 
occasions. S. Paul's oaths in his Epistles are for confirmation of 
truth deliberately committed to writing (5. Aug., De Mendacio, c. 5).  <p>

<i>What are the conditions for a lawful oath?</i><p>

An oath is lawful if it be lawfully used; but this good use of it 
requires, first, that one swear, not lightly, but discreetly and from a 
necessary cause. Judgment (<i>i.e.</i>, discretion) is the first 
condition of a lawful oath. Next, what is confirmed by the oath must 
not be false nor any unlawful thing. Veracity is the second condition 
of a lawful oath. Lastly, justice is the third condition; what is 
confirmed must be licit. A rash oath lacks discretion; a false oath, 
veracity; an iniquitous or illicit oath lacks justice (Jer. iv. 2).  <p>

<i>Is the oath an act of religion or Divine worship?</i><p>

He who swears invokes the Divine testimony to confirm what he says; and 
his oath contains a profession that God is all powerful, of 
indefectible veracity and perfect omniscience. This is an act of 
reverence, and therefore it is an act of religion or worship. The 
object of the testimony is some human affair, but the testimony invoked 
is Divine. <p>

The earthly aim may be to certify something before men, but with this 
goes the aim of offering reverence and honour to God. <p>

The oath is not sought for its own sake, but as an aid in human defect 
or infirmity, a sort of necessary medicine, 
<!--
350 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. LXXXIX. 7. 
--><A NAME="p350"></a>
 because man disbelieves the witness of his fellow-man. Such things, 
necessary on account of the imperfections of this life, are unduly used 
if they are needlessly employed. <p>

An oath differs from a vow, because what is confirmed by the oath does 
not on that account become an act of religion, whereas the vow makes 
the action (fasting, continence, etc.) such.  <p>

<i>Has an oath obligatory force?</i><p>

The question is of the force of promissory oaths. In an assertory oath, 
the obligation does not concern the thing which has been or is, but the 
act itself of taking the oath; one swears that which is or has been 
true. But in the promissory oath, the obligation concerns the thing 
which has been confirmed by an oath. One is bound to make that true 
which he has sworn; otherwise his oath lacks the essential condition of 
veracity. But if the oath cannot possibly be kept, it lacks discretion 
or judgment unless, perhaps, it was possible to keep it when made, but 
it has been rendered impossible by some unforeseen event as when one 
swears that he will pay a certain sum of money, which has afterwards 
been stolen from him. Then he seems to be excused from doing what he 
has sworn, although he is bound to do what in him lies to fulfil his 
promise. <p>

But if the fulfilment is possible, indeed, but ought not to be done, 
either because it is evil <i>per se</i>, or is a serious impediment to 
the good, then the oath lacks justice, and therefore the oath is not to 
be kept when it is sin, or a serious hindrance to good. (It was sin to 
take such an oath; it is an added sin to keep it.) <p>

Whoever, then, swears that he will do a thing, is obliged to do it, 
that truth may he kept, provided that judgment and justice are also 
present (Num. xxx. 2). <p>

(1) The promise has veracity, if it express the present  
<!--
Qu. LXXXIX. 7.] ON OATHS. 351 
--><A NAME="p351"></a>
 purpose; but the oath invokes the Divine attestation to a fixed and 
unchangeable purpose. <p>

(2) An oath may tend to evil in two ways; in one way, because it had 
from the beginning an evil result, either because the thing sworn is 
evil in itself, or because it is an impediment to some greater good. 
Such oaths are illicit from the beginning, but differently. For if one 
swear that he will do some sin, he sins in swearing, and he sins in 
keeping the oath. But if he swear that he will not do some better good, 
which, however, he is not bound to do, he sins in swearing by opposing 
the Holy Spirit, who is the inspirer of every good purpose; but he 
does not sin in keeping his oath, although he would do better if he did 
not keep it. <p>

An oath may have a bad result in another way, on account of some 
unforeseen event, as was the case with Herod's oath, who swore to give 
his daughter whatever she asked for. This oath might have been lawful 
at first, the due condition being understood, viz., that she should ask 
for what it was right to give; but the fulfilment of the oath was 
illicit. <p>

(3) Suppose that one takes a lawful oath under compulsion. There is a 
two-fold obligation to be considered; one to the man who receives the 
pronuse -- such obligation is annulled by the force employed; he does 
not deserve that the promise to him be kept. But there is another 
obligation to God, the fulfilling what has been promised in His name. 
Conscience is not released from that obligation (unless the force 
destroyed all rational power of action). We ought rather to endure 
temporal loss than break an oath. But one may seek release in court, or 
denounce to authority even if secrecy have been sworn respecting the 
force employed; for such an oath tends to a worse result, being against 
public justice. <p>

(4) Suppose a difference of understanding of the meaning of the oath 
between the two concerned in it. If this come 
<!--
352 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. LXXXIX. 9. 
--><A NAME="p352"></a>
 from the fraud of him who takes the oath, he is bound to keep it 
according to the sound understanding of it on the part of the one who 
receives it. But if there have been no guile, the oath must be 
understood according to the intention of the one who takes it.  <p>

<i>Can any human authority dispense from keeping an oath?</i><p>

We have seen that the necessity of dispensation in the case of laws or 
vows arises from the fact that what is in itself or in general virtuous 
and useful may, through some particular circumstances, become immoral. 
and injurious, and so cannot be fit object for either law or vow. But 
the same principle applies to oaths. If the thing be immoral, it is 
repugnant to that justice which is an essential condilion of a licit 
oath; if it be injurious, it is repugnant to that judgment or 
discretion which is also requisite. And since a man is not the best 
judge in his own ease, and has no authority to he judge, by parity of 
reasoning it follows that the power of dispensation is needed, and is 
to be found in the Church, which has received authority to loose as 
well as to bind (S. Matt. xviii. 18). <p>

(1) But veracity is required equally in promissory as in assertory 
oaths; and no power of dispensation can permit an oath contrary to 
truth respecting the past or the present; therefore no power can permit 
that any one make that to be false which he has promised with an oath 
respecting the future. <p>

I answer that the power of dispensation cannot extend to Divine 
commands, cannot allow anything to be done contrary to what has been 
sworn. But that authority may decide that what was included in the oath 
is no longer such, as being unfit matter for an oath. The object of the 
assertory oath, being past or present, is immutable; and as there is 
no power to dispense from the veracity of the oath itself, there is no 
power of dispensation at all. But the ob<!--
Qu. XCIII. 1.] SUPERSTITION. 353 
 --><A NAME="p353"></a>ject of the promissory oath is something in the future which is 
variable, and may become immoral or injurious, and consequently unfit 
matter for an oath, Such an object may come under the power of 
dispensation. <p>

(2) A man may promise with an oath what is for another's benefit. That 
other can release him from his obligation. But in another way one may 
promise another what pertains to the honour of God, or the benefit of 
the community (as the promise made to the bishop in ordination). The 
promise is chiefly made to God; he who receives it cannot release it 
(unless he have power of dispensation). <p>

Since the oath is for confirmation of veracity, and implies some doubt, 
it seems to be decent that the priesthood should not ordinarily take 
such an oath in temporal affairs. (Let him claim his privilege in 
courts of law, etc.)  <p>

<h4>&sect; 7. Superstition.</h4><p>

(The greater part of the author's discussion of topics under this head 
is adapted to a different state of society from ours. What seems to be 
of special and permanent value will be briefly indicated.) <p>

Superstition is a vice opposed to true religion in its excess; not that 
it offers to God in worship more than religion does, but it gives 
Divine homage to what it ought not, or in a manner it ought not.  <p>

<i>Pernicious worship may possibly be offered to the true God.</i><p>

Thus a lie is most pernicious in what pertains to religion. But it is a 
lie if any one express outwardly by signs, as in religious worship, 
what is contrary to the truth. This is a pernicious worship, and it may 
occur in two ways: First, as respects the thing signified, which may be 
discordant from the signification of Christian worship. Thus it would 
now be pernicious to use those ceremonies of the Old Law by which 
Gospel mysteries were prefigured. (And sitting at 
<!--
354 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. XCIV. 
--><A NAME="p354"></a>
 the reception of the Holy Eucharist was, not many ages ago, made a 
symbol of unbelief in the Lord's Real Presence therein.) <p>

In another way, falsity in outward worship may directly concern the 
worshipper, especially in public worship which is presented by 
ministers in the name of the whole Church. For as it is fraud to claim 
authority for action where none has been given, so he is guilty of 
falsity who in the name of the Church offers worship to God contrary to 
what has been with Divine authority established by the Church, or is 
customary in the Church (so far as custom has the force of positive 
law). They that worship God must worship Him not only in spirit but "in 
truth." (A warning against lawlessness in the Church.)  <p>

<i>Can anything be superfluous in Divine worship?</i><p>

Certainly not, if we speak merely of quantity; for man can do nothing 
which is not less than he owes to God. But something may be superfluous 
in not being proportioned to the end. The end of Divine worship is that 
man may glorify God, and subject himself to God both in body and in 
spirit. And, therefore, whatever a man does which pertains to the glory 
of God and the subjection of his soul, and of his body also, according 
to the ordinances of God and the Church and the customs of those with 
whom he lives, is not superfluous. But if there be anything which does 
not come under any one of these heads, it is to be deemed superfluous 
and superstitious, as consisting only in outward observances which have 
nothing to do with inward worship. "The kingdom of God is within you," 
condemns those superstitious persons who give their chief attention to 
outward ceremonies.  <p>

<i>Idolatry.</i><p>

It is a species of superstition which gives Divine honour where it is 
not due. As in idolatry it is offered to some
<!--
Qu. xciv. 2, 3.] SUPERSTITION. 355 
--><A NAME="p355"></a>
 creature of God through sensible signs -- say, sacrifices, etc.  -- 
so, also, the creature worshipped may be represented by some sensible 
form, which is called an idol (Rom. i. 23).  Idolatry is a mortal sin, 
whether it be giving the outward or the inward worship, a sin condemned 
by the Second Commandment. All superiors are to he revered, but not all 
with the same reverence. Special marks of reverence are due to Almighty 
God; viz., Divine adoration (<i>"latria"</i>). "Outward sacrifices are 
signs of the inward sacrifice, as spoken words are signs of things. 
Wherefore, as in prayer and praise we direct our words to Him to whom 
we offer in our hearts the reality which we signify with our lips, so 
in sacrifice we know that we are to offer the visible part to none save 
to Him before whom we present in our hearts the invisible sacrifice, 
the offering of ourselves" (S. Aug., Civ. Dei, x. 19). <p>

In the temple under the Old Law, and in the Church to-day, images or 
pictures are not introduced that Divine homage may be paid to them, but 
for the sake of what they signify; that faith may be made more real and 
strengthened in the minds of the beholders.  <p>

<i>Idolatry is in its own nature the gravest of sins.</i><p>

The gravest rebellion in a commonwealth is setting up another in place 
of the lawful ruler. So, while sins against God are the greatest of all 
sins, the worst of those sins seems to be the paying Divine honours to 
any creature, which, so far as it goes, is setting up another in place 
of God. <p>

But the gravity of sin depends also upon the sinner's inward state; for 
sins of malice are far worse than sins of ignorance. And so the heretic 
who with eyes open corrupts the faith which he has once received, may 
be worse than lhe ignorant idolater. 
<!--
356 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. XCVII.  
--><A NAME="p356"></a>
Attempts at divination, through "clairvoyance" or otherwise, are not 
uncommon sins. <p>

The future may he foreseen through its causes, and if those causes have 
necessary and invariable effects, those effects may be foretold with 
absolute certainty, as in the prediction of eclipses. And certain 
events are so generally followed by others that the first may be 
reasonable ground for prediction, as in the case of medical diagnosis. 
But there are other causes, like the free-will of man, which are not 
determined to one necessary result, and their effects can be predicted 
by God only, who in His eternity sees in one vision what we call past, 
present, and future. And if any one presume to have this knowledge of 
future contingencies, he manifestly usurps what belongs to God alone. 
This is the sin of divination. It may be from the temptation of devils, 
who try to seduce the minds of men by such idle search into the unknown 
future. <p>

The end sought may be idle curiosity, but the means used belong to evil 
superstition. (See Isa. viii. 19.)  <p>

<h4>&sect; 8. Irreligion; viz., Tempting God, perjury, sacrilege, and 
simony.</h4><p>

We are now to consider vices opposed to religion, which spring from 
contempt or irreverence towards God and holy things.  <p>

<i>Tempting God.</i><p>

We try another by our words, in order to ascertain whether he knows 
what we ask or is able or willing to do it. We try another by our 
actions to prove his judgment, will, or power. We try him openly, 
professing our purpose, or secretly, as the Pharisees tempted Christ 
(S. Matt. xxii.). So man tempts God sometimes in words, sometimes in 
deeds. <p>

One would be expressly tempting God in His prayers if he should ask 
anything in order to make experiment of 
<!--
Qu. XCVIII.] PERJURY. 357 
--><A NAME="p357"></a>
 God's love, power, or knowledge (as in the "prayer-test" proposed by 
Professor Tyndall). Constructively he does the same who asks what is 
of no other use than such a test. <p>

In his deeds one expressly tempts God when, by what he does, he intends 
to make trial of his God; constructively he may be doing the same thing 
by his words. <p>

When, therefore, on account of some necessary or useful end one commits 
himself in his petitions or in his actions to the Divine aid, he does 
not tempt God. But apart from such occasions the commandment is, "Thou 
shalt not tempt the Lord thy God" (S. Matt. iv. 7).  <p>

<i>Tempting God, then, is a sin.</i><p>

For no one tries experiments on that of which he is certain. Every 
trial proceeds from some ignorance or doubt, either in him who makes 
the trial, as when he wishes to find out the qualities of a thing, or 
in others, as when he tries an experiment to show something to those 
others. In this latter way God is said to tempt us. But ignorance or 
doubt of what pertains to God's perfection is a sin. Tempting God, 
then, in order to know His power, is a sin. But it is not tempting God 
when one desires to show to others the greatness of God, for some just 
necessity or pious utility. For so the apostles (Acts iv. 30) prayed, 
and asked God that "signs and wonders might be done through the name of 
Jesus," for the conversion of unbelievers. <p>

Since tempting God is a direct act of irreverence in doubting of His 
excellency, it is directly opposed to religion.  <p>

<i>Perjury.</i><p>

This in assertory oaths is falsity; but if a man swears what he 
believes to be true, though it is in reality false, his act is perjury 
(material perjury), but he is not a perjurer (formal perjury). This of 
assertory oaths; but an imperfect kind of perjury may be found also in 
promissory oaths, when they lack justice. For in swearing an illicit 
thing, he incurs 
<!--
358 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. XCVIII. 
--><A NAME="p358"></a>
 falsity, because he is under obligation to do the contrary of his 
oath. And if he swear indiscreetly, he incurs the danger of being false 
to his oath. <p>

Every act of perjury is a sin against religion, for it is a sign of 
irreverence towards God that he is invoked to attest a lie. This 
implies either that God does not know the truth, or that he is willing 
to attest a falsehood. <p>

(1) He who swears that he will do an unlawful action commits imperfect 
perjury in the act of swearing, on account of the lack of justice; but 
there is no perjury in not doing what he has sworn to do, because the 
thing was not the proper object of an oath. (There need be no 
perplexity in such a case. The sin was in swearing; it would be an 
added sin to fulfil the oath.) <p>

(2) In like manner, he who swears that he will not do some good action 
which he ought to do, sins in the lack of judgment. But he is not 
perjured if he do that action, for what he swore to could not be fit 
object of an oath. <p>

(3) So, again, if one swear that he will do another's will, obey 
another's commands, the due conditions are implied; <i>sc.</i>, that 
the command be lawful, virtuous, and not intolerably difficult to 
execute. Otherwise there is no perjury in violating the oath. <p>

(4) But may not some change occurring after the oath is taken release 
from its obligation? New members join the society which has taken an 
oath; are they bound by it? New statutes are made in an institution. 
Does the former oath which has been taken respecting old statutes bind 
one to observe the new? To the first case I answer that the oath is a 
personal action, and does not bind him who has not taken it. But if any 
one enter a society and share its advantages, he is bound to submit to 
its burdens, or else to leave it at once. To the last question I reply 
that the oath does not bind one to keep new laws for all future time, 
but the member of the institution is bound by the coactive force of its 
laws so long as he remains in it. 
<!--
Qu. c. 1.] SIMONY. 359  
--><A NAME="p359"></a>
 Perjury is mortal sin, both because it directly violates the express 
command of God (Lev. xix. 12), and because it implies contempt of Him. <p>

Even he who swears jestingly is guilty of irreverence towards God. But 
he who swears falsely through <i>"lapsus linguae"</i> if he be fully 
conscious of his act, is not excused from contempt of God; but if the 
action were inadvertent, there was no intention of taking an oath, and 
no perjury.  <p>

<i>Sacrilege.</i><p>

What is set apart for Divine service is sacred; reverence for it is 
referable to God, whose it is in special manner. Irreverent treatment 
of it is doing injury to God; it is sacrilege. <p>

It has its own special deformity, in violating sacred things; it is 
therefore a special sin, opposed to religion, which reverences what 
belongs to God. <p>

Sacrilege differs as what is sacred differs. There are consecrated 
persons, consecrated places, and consecrated things. The greater the 
sanctity violated, the greater is the sacrilege. Violation of sacred 
persons is graver than violation of sacred places, for the place was 
made sacred for man, not man for the place. <p>

Similarly, in the third kind of sacrilege, that against things, most 
sacred are the sacraments by which man is sanctified; gravest, 
therefore, is sacrilege respecting the Holy Eucharist, the sacrament of 
the Lord's Body and. Blood. Next comes sacrilege respecting the holy 
vessels of the sacraments; then what pertains to the ornaments of the 
Church and the vestments of its ministers; then sacrilege respecting 
what is offered to God for the support of the ministers of the altar. 
Whoever sins against any of these falls into the crime of sacrilege.  <p>

<i>Simony is a sin.</i><p>

Spiritual things cannot be bought and sold. First, they 
<!--
360 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. c. 2. 
--><A NAME="p360"></a>
 cannot be compensated by any earthly price. And S. Peter condemned the 
depravity of Simon in its very root whcn he said, "Thy money perish 
with thee; because thou hast thought that the gift of God can be 
purchased with money" (Acts viii. 20). Secondly, no one can sell what 
is not his own. The clergy are not owners of spiritual things, but only 
dispensers of them, "stewards of the mysteries of God" (1 Cor. iv. 1). 
Thirdly, selling is repugnant to the origin of spiritual things, which 
come from the free grace of God. "Freely ye have received, freely give" 
(S. Matt. x. 8). Therefore simony, or buying and selling some spiritual 
thing, is the sin of irreverence towards God and Divine things. <p>

When simony is defined as the deliberate buying or selling some 
spiritual thing, or what is annexed to such a thing, understand by 
buying or selling any contract which is not gratuitous.  <p>

<i>Is it always unlawful to give and to receive money for the 
sacraments?</i><p>

The sacraments of the Gospel are preeminently spiritual things, 
inasmuch as they are the means of spiritual grace whose value cannot be 
estimated in money; and it is against their nature that they should not 
be given gratuitously. But they are dispensed by the ministers of the 
Church, who must be supported by the people; so the apostle says (1 
Cor. ix. 13), "Know ye not that they who minister about sacred things 
eat of the things of the temple, and they which wait upon the altar 
have their portion with the altar?" Therefore to receive money for the 
spiritual grace of the sacraments is the crime of simony, which no 
custom can excuse, because custom cannot violate natural or Divine 
law, and simony is forbidden by both of them. And by money is to be 
understood anything whose value can be estimated in money. <p>

But to receive money for the support of those who min<!--
Qu. c. 8.] SIMONY. 361 
 --><A NAME="p361"></a>ister Christ's sacraments is not simony nor any sin. For it is not 
taken as pay, but as a necessary stipend. <p>

<i>It is better to go without the sacraments than to sin by purchasing 
them.</i><p>

The same remark applies to Holy Matrimony. The blessing of the Church 
cannot be purchased. If the priest merely solemnized the civil 
contract, he might be paid for doing so.  <p>

<i>Is it lawful to give and to receive money for other spiritual 
ministrations?</i><p>

As the sacraments are called spiritual because they confer spiritual 
grace, so certain other things are called so because they either 
proceed from spiritual grace or dispose man for it. <p>

Yet these require the ministry of men, who must be supported by those 
who receive these benefits (1 Cor. ix. 7). To sell or buy acts of this 
nature is simoniacal. But to give and receive something for the support 
of those who minister in these spiritual things, according to the 
ordinance of the Church and approved custom, is lawful, if the 
simoniacal intention be not there, and if the demand be not made on 
those unwilling to contribute, by withholding those spiritual 
ministrations. For this would be a kind of selling. But when spiritual 
ministrations have been already freely bestowed, it is lawful to 
demand, from those who are able but unwilling to give, the appointed 
and customary offering for clerical support (say, the pew rent). <p>

The case of the physician or lawyer is not the same. He who has any 
science does not get with it the obligation to use it for every one 
alike, as do the ministers of spiritual things. The former may receive 
pay, not as selling their science, but in exchange for their labours. 
But if they were bound by the obligation of their office to give their 
services, as in the case of a hospital physician, etc., they would 
grievously sin in selling their services. 
<!--
362 RELIGION AND OPPOSED VICES. [Qu. c. 4.  
--><A NAME="p362"></a><p>

<i>Some things are so annexed to spiritualities as to depend upon them, 
as the benefice of a rector, which can only be held by a clergyman.</i> <p>

The sale of such things would be understood as the sale of spiritual 
things, and is unlawful. <p>

But other things are annexed to the spiritual as being ordained for 
them, as the right of presentation to a living, or the sacred vessels 
(not yet consecrated and used) which are prepared. for sacramental use. 
Such things precede the spiritual in order of time, and may be sold, 
but not as annexed to the spiritual. <p>

In case of need for the Church or the poor, even the consecrated 
vessels may be broken and sold for their value as precious metals. <p>

There is another form of simony, when spiritual things -- say, office 
in the Church -- are given as a reward for personal service, or, in 
response to a request, in order to obtain some temporal advantage. What 
can be estimated in pecuniary value is equivalent to money, when simony 
is in question. <p>

Nepotism is a sin in these matters, but it is not simony, unless some 
temporal advantage is in some way expected. <p>
