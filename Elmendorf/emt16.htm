<h3>CHAPTER V.  DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS, DEPENDING ON JUSTICE, AND THEIR 
OPPOSITE VICES.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Piety, reverence, and honour.</h4><p>

<i>What is piety towards men?</i><p>

Man becomes a debtor towards others in various degrees and manners, 
according to their diverse excellence and the diverse benefits which he 
receives from them. In both God holds the highest place, as infinitely 
excellent and as the first principle of our being and of our direction 
in life. <p>

But, in the second place, as the source of our being and the orderers 
of our life, stand our parents and our country. Next to God, then, we 
owe service to our parents and our country. <p>

But in this service due to parents is included that of our near 
relatives who are descended from the same parental stock. And in the 
service of our country is implied that of our fellow-citizens and of 
all friends of our country. (Patriotism is a part of piety towards 
man.) <p>

The word "piety" is often applied to the service which we owe to God, 
who is the Father of us all. But the greater includes the less, and now 
we use the term in the more restricted sense. <p>

Works of mercy, also, are sometimes called pious works for a similar 
reason, being part of our service towards God.  <p>

<i>It is filial piety to provide for the support of parents.</i><p>

For the Lord, in rebuking the Pharisees (S. Matt. xv. 5), taught us 
that this is part of the honour due to those who are the source of our 
being. 
<!--
364 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. CI. 8, 4.  
--><A NAME="p364"></a>
 Some things are due to parents and fellow-citizens as such; some 
things are due in special circumstances. To a father, as father, are 
due reverence and dutiful conduct. But he may be sick; then provision 
must be made for his infirmity. He may be poor; then his children owe 
him support, and all such things are included in dutiful conduct. This 
is part of the law of nature, as well as of the civil code. <p>

The Common Law is to the same effect. "The child is equally 
compellable, if of sufficient ability, to maintain and provide for a 
wicked and unnatural progenitor, as for one who has shown the greatest 
tenderness and parental piety" (Blackst., i. p. 454). <p>

Why, then, does S. Paul say (2 Cor. xii. 14), "The children ought not 
to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children"? Because 
the father is bound to this <i>per se</i>, since children are his 
natural successors. But the child is not bound to lay up for a parent 
whom in the course of nature he will survive. The case before us, 
however, is that of present, not future, need.  <p>

Piety has its special object; <i>sc.</i>, parents and country, and 
those connected with these, under the special idea of payiug duty and 
service to those who are the sources and directors of ourselves. <p>

Therefore piety is a special virtue, a special manifestation of charity.  <p>

<i>May the duties of filial piety be neglected on account of religious 
duties?</i> <p>

The Pharisees were sternly rebuked by Christ (S. Matt. xv.) for putting 
religion in the place of natural piety. Both are virtues, and cannot 
contradict one another, nor can the act of one exclude the act of the 
other. <p>

The act of every virtue is limited by due circumstances, and if these 
are neglected, the act will be vicious, not virtu<!--
Qu. ci. 4.] PIETY, REVERENCE, AND HONOUR. 365  
 --><A NAME="p365"></a>ous. Now piety exhibits duty and service to parents according to 
the due mode. But it is not the due mode that parents should be set 
above God. If, then, the service of parents withdraw us from the 
service of God, it will not be filial piety if we persist in that 
service against God (who is the source of the filial obligation). In 
such a case, God must come first. But if dutiful conduct towards 
parents does not totally withdraw us from God's service, this conduct 
is required by piety, and we may not neglect it on account of religion. <p>

There are, indeed, words of the Gospel, liable to be misunderstood, 
which seem to justify neglect of parents on account of religion. Thus, 
the Lord said (S. Luke xiv. 26), "If any one come unto Me, and hate not 
his father and mother, he cannot be My disciple." And, again, it 
seems to be said in praise of SS. James and John, that "they 
straightway left the boat and their father and followed Him." So it was 
said of Levi of old (Deut. xxxiii. 9), that be "said of his father and 
mother, I have not seen him." And to the man who said (S. Matt. viii. 
22), "Suffer me first to go and bury my father," the Lord replied, "Let 
the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God." 
This pertains to religion; but burying a father is a work of filial 
piety. Therefore, piety gave way to religion. <p>

But as for the first quotation, parents who are adversaries towards God 
are to be fled from as if they were bated. If they try to induce us to 
sin, or to withdraw us from God's service, we do right to desert them. 
So the Levites ignored their kinsmen when the question arose of 
punishing idolaters according to God's command. SS. James and John left 
their father and followed the Lord, not because be tempted them to sin, 
but because they judged that he did not need them at that time for his 
support. <p>

There were others who could bury a father, but the Lord, who knows all 
hearts, called the son from many evils which 
<!--
366 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. cii. 1, 2. 
--><A NAME="p366"></a>
 would probably follow his father's death (S. Chrys., Hom. xxviii. in 
Matt.). <p>

We call God "our Father" because the very things which filial piety 
shows to earthly parents are referred to God, as other works of mercy 
which are done to our neighbours are offered to Him; and the King will 
say, "Inasmuch as ye did it unto the least of these My brethren, ye did 
it unto Me" (S. Matt. xxv. 40). <p>

So I repeat, if our service is so necessary to earthly parents that 
they cannot be duly supported without it, and they do not induce us to 
anything against God, we ought not to desert them for the sake of 
religion. But if we must sin in order to fulfil those duties to them, 
or even if without our assistance they can be duly sustained, it is 
lawful to leave those filial duties at the call of religion.  <p>

Reverence (<i>"observantia"</i>) is a virtue, a form of piety,  by 
which due worship and honour are rendered to those who hold office and 
dignity.  <p>

As an earthly father participates towards us in the universal 
fatherhood of God, so another who shares in a father's care of us, our 
education and training, is a quasi father, and shares a father's claims 
upon us. But a person in authority participates in the Divine rule 
after his earthly manner, as civil rulers, commanders in the army and 
navy, teachers in their school, etc. It is piety which gives worship 
and honour ("your worship," "your reverence ") to such dignitaries. 
Their official excellence or dignity entitles them to honour; their 
authority entitles them to that worship which consists in dutiful 
service, their lawful orders being obeyed, and their benefits repaid in 
some manner. <p>

There is a legal observance which is due to those who have authority 
over ourselves; but there is also a moral observance, which is due to 
official superiority, even if we are not subject to it. 
<!--
Qu. cm. 1, 2.] PIETY, REVERENCE, AND HONOUR. 367  
--><A NAME="p367"></a><p>

<i>Honour implies outward testimony to another's excellence.</i> <p>

Before God the testimony of the heart suffices, but towards men such 
testimony can be given only by outward signs, as words, or gestures, or 
offering of gifts, or erecting statues. Honour, then, consists in 
corporeal signs. It is not the same as reverence, which may be either 
the cause of the honour shown, or the end of the honour, when one is 
honoured in order that others may reverence him. Praise which consists 
in words is included in honour, although honour is also of wider 
extent, being not only rendered for what is intended for some end, but 
also for those best things which are the very end itself. Glory is the 
result of praise and honour.  <p>

<i>Honour is due to any one only on the ground of some excellence or 
superiority.</i> <p>

It is not necessary that he who is honoured be in all ways, or even in 
any way, superior to the one who honours him, because he may be 
superior to certain others, or have some special excellence in some 
special particular. Vicious superiors may be honoured, not as superior 
in virtue, but because of their dignity as ministers of God; in them, 
also, the whole community over which they preside is honoured. The 
apostle said (Rom. xii. 10). "In honour preferring one another;" and, 
again (1 S. Pet. ii. 17), "Honour all men," for in every one may be 
something for which he is accounted superior to another; "in lowliness 
of mind each counting other better than himself" (Phil. ii. 3). 
Service, homage (<i>"dulia"</i>), is due to those who have dominion 
over others as a kind of participation in the Divine dominion which 
demands Divine service. Taken in its wider sense, this service or 
homage, or <i>dulia</i>, is of various kinds, as of servants towards 
their master, of soldiers to their officers, of scholars to their 
teachers, etc.

--><A NAME="p368"></a><p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Obedience and disobedience.</h4><p>

<i>Is a man ever bound to obey another man?</i><p>

God commands, "Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit 
yourselves" (Heb. xiii. 17). In the natural order Divinely instituted 
there are lower and higher ranks, some whose place it is to command 
through reason and will, others whose place it is to obey. No necessity 
compels as irrational creatures are driven; the obedience is freely 
rendered by deliberate choice of it. <p>

(1) The Divine will is the primal rule of action regulating all human 
wills, but to that Divine will one human will and judgment approaches 
nearer than another in the Divinely instituted order. He who has right 
to command becomes a secondary rule for him who obeys.  <p>

(2) It might be objected that the more services are gratuitous, the 
more acceptable they are. If, then, man is bound by obligation to obey 
others in doing certain good things, his obedience detracts from the 
merit of his good deed and renders it less acceptable. <p>

But "gratuitous" has two meanings. On the part of the work it means 
that which one is not obliged to do; on the part of the worker it means 
that he acts with free choice. But the deed becomes virtuous, laudable, 
and meritorious chiefly as it proceeds from free-will. And, therefore, 
although obedience is an obligation, yet if it is rendered by a prompt 
and ready will, its merit is not diminished on this account, especially 
before God, who views the heart as well as the outward works.  <p>

Obedience is in itself a special virtue, having as its special object 
the command of a lawful superior, tacit or express, according to that 
Divine order which is appointed in this world. <p>

So it is specially commanded (Titus iii. 1), "Put them in mind to be in 
subjection to rulers, to authorities, to be 
<!--
Qu. civ. 3.] OBEDIENCE AND DISOBEDIENCE. 369 
--><A NAME="p369"></a>
 obedient." The will of a superior, however known, is a tacit precept, 
and when, by obeying, an express precept is anticipated, the obedience 
seems to be more prompt and free. <p>

(1) There may be other reasons for doing the thing commanded; it may be 
an act of some other virtue, although not all the acts of virtue are 
objects of command (some are counsels of perfection). But some things 
also are objects of command which would not be evil if they were not 
prohibited (as police regulations, or the observance of certain days of 
abstinence). Thus, disobedience is evidently a special sin in contempt 
of lawful command. <p>

(2) This moral virtue, which is a part of justice, like every other 
virtue requires a ready will for its proper object, but not for that 
which is repugnant to the will. Now the proper object of obedience is 
the command proceeding from another's will. But if that which is 
commanded be willed for its own sake, as happens in what is agreeable 
to one's wishes, it may not seem to be done for the sake of the 
command, but from one's own independent choice. <p>

But when that which is commanded, considered in itself, is repugnant to 
our own will because it is disagreeable, then the command is manifestly 
the ground of the action. Therefore S. Gregory said (Moral., lib. ult. 
c. 10), "Obedience in pleasant things, which has something of its own 
in it, is either no obedience, or at least is less." <p>

But this applies to outward manifestations. For, according to the 
judgment of God, who searches the heart, obedience which has "something 
of its own" may be none the less laudable, if the promptly obedient 
will none the less sincerely aim at fulfilling the precept.  <p>

<i>Is obedience chief among virtues?</i><p>

As sin consists in man's despising God and adhering to changeable 
goods, so the merit of a virtuous act consists in making God our end. 
Greater, then, are the theological
<!--
370 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS.	[Qu. civ. 3. 
--><A NAME="p370"></a>
 virtues by which the soul cleaves to God than the moral virtues by 
which some earthly thing is rejected in order that the soul may cleave 
to God, because the end is greater than the means to that end. <p>

But among moral virtues any one of them is greater as it rejects a 
greater thing for this end. But there are three kinds of earthly goods 
which may be given up for God's sake; earthly goods (as in liberality) 
and bodily goods (as in temperance); but highest are the goods of the 
soul, and supreme among them is our will, through which all other goods 
are used. Therefore, in itself obedience is more laudable, in its 
giving up one's own will, than any other moral virtue. Hence S. Gregory 
says (<i>loc. cit.</i>), "Obedience is better than the sacrifice of outward 
things, because this may offer the flesh of another, but obedience 
sacrifices our own will." Hence virtuous deeds of any kind are accepted 
-- by God as meritorious in His sight because they are done through this 
motive of obedience to His will. For if I give my body to be burned in 
martyrdom, or bestow all my goods to feed the poor, unless I ordain 
this for the fulfilling of the Divine will, I am nothing. Charity 
cannot exist without obedience, and without charity all my works are 
empty of title to reward. "He that saith, I know God, and keepeth not 
His commandments, is a liar and the truth is not in him. But whoso 
keepeth His word, in him verily hath the love of God been perfected" (I 
Ep. S. John ii. 4). <p>

Why did Samuel say (1 Sam. xv. 22), "To obey is better than sacrifice," 
which is a part of religion, the highest of moral virtues? I answer 
that obedience in all its species springs from reverence towards a 
superior which offers him worship and honour. As it proceeds from 
reverence for those who hold high office, it is contained in 
observance. As it comes from reverence for parents, it belongs to 
piety. But as it proceeds from reverence towards God, it is a part of 
religion, and pertains to devotion, which is the chief act of religion. 
In this aspect of it, to obey is more laudable 
<!--
Qu. civ. 5, 6.] OBEDIENCE AND DISOBEDIENCE 371
--><A NAME="p371"></a>
 than to offer sacrifice; to offer our own will than to immolate the 
flesh of a victim.  <p>

<i>Are those subject to authority bound to obey their superiors in all 
things?</i><p>

Holy Scripture says (Acts v. 29), "we ought to obey God rather than 
men." And sometimes the commands of those who have authority are 
against the will of God. Therefore obedience is not due in all things. 
For two reasons the inferior may not be bound always to obey his 
Superior. First, a higher power may give an opposite command; and 
secondly, the superior may pretend to command where he has no authority 
to do so. The better part of a man comes under no earthly dominion; in 
the inward actions of the will man is bound to obey no one but God. Man 
may be subject to man in what he has to do through bodily action, but 
in what pertains to his body itself God is the only Lord. For all are 
created equal in what pertains to the support of life, the creation of 
a family. Hence servants are not bound to obey their masters, nor 
children their parents, in contracting matrimony, or choosing celibacy. <p>

But in what pertains to the ordering of life's actions the subject is 
bound by his superior's commands within the limits of his authority, as 
the soldier to his officer in military affairs, the servant to his 
master in servile works, the son to his father in life's discipline and 
domestic affairs. <p>

This, doubtless, is the meaning of what the apostle said (Col. iii. 
20), "Children, obey your parents in all things;" <i>i.e.</i>, all 
things within the scope of parental right. <p>

In reasonable doubt we must stand by authority, for <i>"melior est 
conditio possidentis"</i>. <p>

<i>Christians are bound to obey the secular power.</i><p>

"Be subject to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether it 
be to the king as supreme, or unto gov<!--
372 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. cv. 
 --><A NAME="p372"></a>ernors, as sent by him" (1 5. Pet. ii. 13). For the faith of Christ 
is the very foundation of justice; and by that faith the order of 
justice is not taken away, but rather established. But the order of 
justice requires that the inferior obey the superior, otherwise human 
society could not continue. <p>

(1) But are not "the children free"? Yes; through the grace of Christ, 
free from the spiritual bondage of sin. But that grace does not 
liberate from corporeal defects, or from earthly rulers. <p>

(2) But S. Paul was "dead to the law" (Rom. vii. 4), and human law is 
of less account than the Divine law of the Old Testament. Yes; but 
that Old Law was a figure of the New Testament, and so came to an end 
when the truth appeared. The case is not similar in human law. <p>

(3) But men are not bound to obey robbers; and many a state is founded 
in usurpation or robbery, and many a ruler is as unjust as the rest of 
men. Yes; but obedience is due so far as justice requires, and no 
farther. No one is bound to obey usurped power (until, at least, 
general acceptance gives it the sanctions of legitimacy), or unjust 
commands, except accidentally, to avoid scandal or danger to self or 
others.  <p>

<i>Disobedience: is it a mortal sin?</i><p>

That is, is it contrary to charity, which is the soul's life? Charity 
is love of God and our neighbour. But charity towards God demands that 
we keep His commandments. Therefore disobedience to Divine precepts is 
mortal sin. But among Divine precepts is the command to obey those in 
authority. Therefore disobedience of this kind is also mortal sin. "He 
that resisteth the power, withstandeth the ordinance of God" (Rom. 
xiii. 2). And Rom. i. 30 places disobedience to parents in the same 
category. But when anything is done contrary to the precept, yet not 
<!--
Qu. cvi. 1, 2.] GRATITUDE. 373 
--><A NAME="p373"></a>
 through contempt of it, the disobedient act pertains to some other sin 
("formally"), and may be a venial one. <p>

(1) Disobedience is the child of vainglory, which may be a sin not 
mortal. Yet since venial sin is a disposition to mortal transgression, 
vainglory may produce what is infinitely worse than itself. <p>

(2) No one is obliged to impossibilities; and if the superior lay so 
many burdens on those under him that they cannot be endured, the 
"material" act of disobedience is no sin.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. Gratitude, ingratitude, and vengeance.</h4><p>

Gratitude is a special virtue which returns thanks and recompense to 
benefactors. <p>

The greater, indeed, contains the less; so that gratitude to God is 
part of religion, and gratitude to parents is part of piety, and 
gratitude to superiors from whom come public benefits is part of 
observance; but there are also other benefactors from whom some 
particular and private benefits are received, and gratitude is due to 
them also. <p>

Proportional return for favours received, if viewed as a debt, pertains 
to commutative justice. But gratitude is the return which is made as 
due to moral indebtedness alone, which debt one pays of his own accord.  <p>

<i>The penitent owes most gratitude to God.</i><p>

"To whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little " (S. Luke vii. 
47). But where there is greater favour shown, there greater thanks are 
due. The grace may be greater in amount. So viewed, the innocent owes 
greater thanks, other things being equal, because he has received from 
God in larger measure and in longer continuance. But the grace is 
greater also when it is given from more abounding love. From this point 
of view it is the penitent who owes most thankful love, because he has 
received from more abounding love. For when he was worthy of death he 
<!--
374 DUTIES TOWARDS OTUERS. [Qu. cvi. 3.
--><A NAME="p374"></a>
 received the gift of grace. So his gift is comparatively greater, just 
as a small gift to the poor is relatively greater than a large gift to 
the rich.  <p>

<i>Natural order requires that gratitude be rendered to every 
benefactor.</i><p>

But what if favours be conferred with delay and insult, or marks of 
dissatisfaction? It is the sign of a good mind to attend more to the 
good than to the evil. If any one has conferred a benefit in an 
unsuitable manner, thanks are still due, though gratitude requires less 
because the favour is less. <p>

Suppose that one confers a favour on another for his own advantage. Let 
Seneca meet the difficulty (De Benefic. vi. 12) "One may confer a 
benefit for his own sake, or for ours, or for both his and ours. And 
there is a wide difference between these. He who merely looks after 
himself, and benefits us because otherwise he cannot benefit himself, 
seems to me like one who provides fodder for his sheep. But if he have 
only admitted me to fellowship with himself, if he have thought of us 
both, I am not only unjust but ungrateful if I am not glad that what 
has benefited me has also benefited him. It is the height of malignity 
to deny a benefit unless it has put the giver to inconvenience." <p>

Are we bound to thank a servant for favours received. from him? Let 
Seneca answer again (lib. iii. c. 2): "As long as a servant does his 
ordinary duty, it is his service when he does more, he puts himself in 
a friend's place, and confers a benefit." He has a moral claim for 
grateful acts. <p>

Again, it may be said that no one is bound to do what he cannot do 
honourably and usefully; but a benefactor may be in such prosperous 
circumstances that recompense is useless; or be may become so vicious 
that recompense would be unbecoming; or he who is benefited is poor, 
and unable to make return. <p>

But the poor is not ungrateful if he do what he can. 
<!--
Qu. cvi. 4, 5.l GRATITUDE. 375 
--><A NAME="p4"></a>
 And since the benefaction consists more in the affection of the heart 
than in its outward result, the recompense also is principally the 
gratitude of the soul. Reverence and honour can be given, no matter how 
prosperous a benefactor may be. <p>

But even if a benefactor have fallen into vicious habits, still 
recompense must be made according to his condition; <i>e.g.</i>, by 
using efforts to recall him if possible to a better life. But if his 
wickedness be incurable, he is differently affected from what he was 
before, and recompense is therefore no longer due, except in grateful 
recollection of what is past. <p>

Lastly, suppose that requital of favours received is useless or 
injurious to the recipient. Recompense chiefly depends on the affection 
of the heart, and is outwardly to be made in that way which seems to be 
most useful. And if afterwards through his negligence it turn to his 
own loss, that is not to be imputed to our gratitude in making the 
return. <p>

The inward gratitude is to be offered at once; the outward return, at 
the most opportune season. Undue haste in returning gift for gift does 
not seem to be virtuous recompense, but unwillingness to be indebted 
for a favour.  <p>

<i>Acts of gratitude are due according to a benefactor's good will, not 
merely according to the favour conferred.</i><p>

As the requital of a benefit pertains to justice and is a kind of 
legal debt, recompense considers the quantity of the thing bestowed. 
But gratitude regards the benefit as freely given. Therefore it 
considers more the intention than the actual effect. <p>

It is true that God only sees the benefactor's heart; but signs of good 
will are visible, as the prompt and cheerful action of a friend who 
assists us. <p>

The requital, therefore, is after the same pattern, not measuring 
<i>quid pro quo</i>, but rather exceeding the favour received.
<!--
376 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. cvii. 1, 3. 
--><A NAME="p376"></a><p>

<i>Inqratitude</i>. -- Ingratitude is always a sin, counted with other 
sins of the last days (2 Tim. iii. 2).</i><p> 

For gratitude is a moral obligation which virtue requires and pays. <p>

(1) Gratitude is for benefits; but he who helps another in sin does not 
confer a benefit, but rather does an injury. To him no thanks are due, 
unless perhaps for his good will if he have been himself deceived and 
have thought that he was aiding in the good. And then the recompense is 
not the aiding him in sin; for this would not be paying him in good 
return but in evil, which is contrary to gratitude. <p>

(2) Inability excuses no one from gratitude, because that debt is paid 
by a grateful will. But forgetfulness pertains to ingratitude; not, 
indeed, that which proceeds from natural defect of memory, which is not 
subject to the will, but that which is due to negligence. <p>

(3) You may say, he does not appear to sin who is unwilling to be under 
obligation to another; and S. Paul says (Rom. xiii. 8), "Owe no man 
anything, save to love one another." But the debt of gratitude is 
derived from the debt of love, from which no one should wish to be 
released. If any one owe this debt unwillingly, that seems to be due to 
defect of love towards his benefactor. <p>

Ingratitude is a special sin, because it is opposed to the special 
virtue of gratitude, in various grades of sin. First is not returning 
benefits; worse is dissembling, not praising for the kindness received; 
worst is want of grateful recognition, through negligence or any other 
such cause. These seem to be negative; but there is also the positive 
ingratitude, first, of returning evil for good; next, of scoffing at 
the benefit; and third, of calling it an injury.  <p>

<i>It is sometimes, indeed, venial sin, being imperfect in its kind; 
but it is also sometimes mortal sin.</i> <p>

The debt of gratitude is one which is freely paid when one 
<!--
Qu. cviii. 1.] VENGEANCE. 377 
--><A NAME="p377"></a>
 is not bound to do so. This may happen to be neglected through mere 
carelessness. <p>

But, on the other hand, there may be inward contempt (which is lack of 
charity); or a benefactor may stand in need of help; ingratitude under 
such and similar circumstances is mortal sin. This negative ingratitude 
and the positive under like conditions are perfected sin, and therefore 
mortal. <p>

Venial ingratitude is not contrary to the habit of charity; it is 
neglect of one of its acts.  <p>

<i>Vengeance (vindicatio): is it lawful?</i><p>

It is not <i>per se</i> evil and illicit. For no such thing can be 
attributed to God, as in S. Luke xviii. 7, "Shall not God avenge His 
elect which cry to Him day and night? . . . I say unto you that He will 
avenge them speedily." Vengeance inflicts some penal evil on the 
offender. Therefore we must consider the <i>animus</i> of him that 
takes vengeance. For if his intention be directed chiefly to the evil 
which he causes, and rests there, his action is altogether unlawful (it 
is revenge); for delighting in another's evil pertains to hate, is 
opposed to charity which requires us to love all men. <p>

Nor is any one excusable in aiming at the evil of him who has unjustly 
caused evil. One is not permitted to hate the man who hates him, for we 
ought not to sin against another because he has first sinned against 
us. This is to be "overcome of evil," which S. Paul prohibits (Rom. 
xii. 21). But if the aim of him who takes vengeance he primarily some 
good which is to be reached by the punishment of the sinner, as his 
amendment, or at least the checking of him and the quiet of others, the 
preservation of justice and the honour of God, vengeance, under due 
conditions and circumstances, may be lawful. <p>

(1) But is not this usurping what belongs to God? He says (Rom. xii. 
19), "Vengeance belongeth unto Me; I will recompense." I answer that 
he who, according to his 
<!--
378 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. CVIII. 1. 
--><A NAME="p378"></a>
 office, inflicts vengeance, does not usurp what is God's, but uses the 
power Divinely conferred upon him. "He is a minister of God; an 
avenger for wrath to him that doeth evil" (Rom. xiii. 4). But if he 
does any such thing apart from the order Divinely instituted, he does 
usurp what belongs to God, and therefore he sins. <p>

(2) The evil are tolerated by the good, who patiently endure injuries 
done to themselves, so far as they ought to do so. But they do not 
tolerate injuries done to their neighbours and to God. <p>

(3) The law of the Gospel is, indeed, a law of love, and therefore 
vengeance is not a terror to those who do right with love in their 
souls, and these alone are properly under the Gospel law. But those who 
are not moved to the good by means of charity may be nominally in the 
Church, but they are not of it, and cannot claim the Gospel law of 
love. <p>

(4) But ought we not to learn from the example of Christ not to revenge 
our injuries, but magnanimously to endure them? Yes; so far as the 
injury pertains to one's own person, if it be best so to do. But the 
injury done sometimes extends to society and to God. And then it may, 
under due conditions, be avenged, and ought to be avenged. Elijah and 
Elisha followed the law of righteousness in what they did, though the 
injuries done were primarily directed against themselves. <p>

(5) What shall we say of the sin of a multitude, as in lynch law 
executed by a mob? Their sin is more injurious than that of one only. 
Yet vengeance is not to be taken for it. A whole diocese cannot be 
excommunicated for the sin of the great majority of its members. "Let 
both grow together until the harvest," lest the wheat be rooted up (5; 
Matt. xiii. 30). <p>

I answer that when the whole people sins, vengeance may visit that 
people, as it does in many a just war; see also the story of the golden 
calf, in Ex. xxxii. But if the correction of the multitude who follow a 
few leaders is to be hoped for, 
<!--
Qu. cviii. 3, 4.] VENGEANCE. 379
--><A NAME="p379"></a>
 vengeance may select the chief offenders, as in Num. xxv. 4. But if 
offenders and innocent are so mingled that there is no distinguishing 
of the one from the other, severity may be unwise. So with respect to 
rulers. Their sin is to be tolerated, if it cannot be punished without 
great scandal among the people, unless the temporal or spiritual injury 
is of more account than the scandal which is to be feared. (A very 
serviceable rule concerning evil and scandal in the Church.) <p>

Observe that the natural inclination to remove what is injurious is in 
all animals, including man. And in us it is a certain aptitude for a 
special virtue, which special virtue proper vengeance is.  <p>

<i>Are penal statutes on the whole just and expedient?</i><p>

Vengeance restraining the evil is lawful and virtuous. Now there are 
those who have little or no love for virtue, who are so restrained 
through fear of losing what they value more than what they gain by 
doing wrong. Fear does restrain sin. Therefore proper vengeance 
consists in taking away what men most value. This is life, liberty, and 
outward goods. The proper penalties, therefore, are capital punishment, 
flogging, imprisonment, exile, loss, ignominy. <p>

(1) The Lord forbade the tares to be rooted up, when that would 
endanger the wheat. But sometimes the bad can be sent out of this 
world, not only without danger to better men, but even for the great 
advantage of the latter. <p>

(2) All mortal sins are worthy of eternal death, according to the 
Divine judgment. But the penalties of this present life are rather 
medicinal; and therefore only those offences deserve capital 
punishment which are the most harmful to other men.  <p>

<i>Is vengeance to light on those who sin involuntarily?</i><p>

Penalty is due only to sin. But all sin is voluntary 
<!--
380 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. CIX. 
--><A NAME="p380"></a>
 therefore involuntary transgression is not to be followed by 
vengeance. <p>

But this applies to vengeance as such. By penalty is repaired the 
violation of justice, due equality is restored; he who has sinned by 
unduly following his own will, suffers something contrary to his will. 
But penalty may be considered also as medicinal; it may aid the healing 
of past wounds, preserve from future ones, promote some good. So 
viewed, punishment sometimes comes on one without his fault, but not 
without cause. <p>

This medicinal punishment, as such, never takes away a greater good for 
the sake of lesser good; but the less may be lost for the sake of 
helping the greater. Thus one may lose earthly goods without his fault 
for the sake of spiritual humiliation or probation. This is Divine 
visitation. But no one is punished with the loss of spiritual goods 
except through his own fault.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. Veracity and vices opposed to it.</h4><p>

Veracity is a special virtue by which our outward words and actions are 
duly made signs of the thoughts of our hearts. <p>

It is a part of justice; not that there is herein any question of 
legal obligation, but there is a moral debt which we owe to others. 
(They have a right not to be deceived by us.) <p>

Because man is made for society, is "a social animal," it is a law of 
nature that each owes to other that without which society cannot be 
preserved. But men cannot live peaceably and securely with one another, 
unless they trust one another's words and actions as signs of their 
thoughts. Therefore veracity is a moral debt which we owe to one 
another. <p>

In affirmation one may, without deceit, fall short of the whole truth, 
as when one does not manifest the whole good that is in himself, his 
knowledge, holiness, or something else of that nature. This does not 
prejudice the truth, for 
<!--
Qu. cx.] VERACITY AND VICES OPPOSED TO IT. 381 
--><A NAME="p381"></a>
 the less is contained in the greater (2 Cor. xii. 6). But negation is 
different; for to deny that one possesses what is really in him, is 
falsity.  <p>

<i>Lying.</i><p>

A moral act takes its character as such from its direct object and from 
its end as the object of the will. Veracity and lying consist in 
voluntary manifestation of thought  through external signs. And the 
object of the manifestation is the true or the false. But the intention 
of the evil will is two-fold: first, to enunciate the false, and, next, 
the effect of that; viz., to deceive another.  <p>

If, then, those three concur, a falsehood enunciated, the will to 
enunciate what is false, and the intention to deceive, then we have 
(1) actual, "material" falsity; (2) moral, "formal" falsity, and (3) 
effectual falsity in the wish to deceive. <p>

But falsehood proper depends on the second of these, and a falsehood is 
that enunciation which is contrary to the mind of the enunciator. <p>

If any one, therefore, enunciates what is false, believing it to be 
true, it is a "material" falsehood, but not formally, morally such, 
because the falsity is contrary to the intention of the enunciator, and 
the assertion falls short of the perfect idea of a falsehood. <p>

But if any one utter what is formally false -- <i>i.e.</i>, having a 
will to enunciate falsehood -- what he says may he actually true, but, 
as voluntary and moral, his act has falsity <i>per se</i> and truth 
accidentally; it is a falsehood. The same principles apply to falsity 
in action. <p>

That any one intend to deceive another, as the effect of his 
enunciation, is not included in the definition of falsehood 
(<i>mendacium</i>), for so would be excluded falsehoods uttered in 
joke, where there is no intention of deceiving. But this intention goes 
to make up the perfection of falsehood.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> 
<!--
382 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. cx. 2.  
--><A NAME="p382"></a><p>

<i>How are falsehoods (mendacia) divided?</i> <p>

Falsehood may transcend the truth, in exaggeration or boasting; it may 
fall short of the truth, in what we will call "irony." <p>

But as a fault or sin, we may divide falsehood according to the end 
aimed at, which aggravates or diminishes the fault. (1) Another's harm 
may be intended; this is an injurious falsehood (<i>mendacium 
perniciosum</i>); (2) some benefit or the removal of some harm may be 
aimed at; this is a serviceable falsehood, a "white lie" (<i>mendacium 
officiosum</i>); (3) it may he uttered simply to give pleasure, as in 
facetious falsehoods, compliments, flattery, etc. (<i>mendacium 
jocosum</i>); these are at least of a less grave character. <p>

S. Augustine's divisions (De Mend. c. 14) with reference to the end 
sought for are more complete: (1) Falsehood against God, in the 
doctrines of religion; (2) against man with the intention of injuring 
some one, and not of benefiting any one; (3) with intention of injuring 
some one for another's benefit. These are forms of injurious falsehood. 
(4) Falsehoods from the mere desire of deceiving, or saying what is 
false, which come from the habitual liar. <p>

(5) Falsehoods which hurt no one, and are uttered for the preservation 
of property; (6) for the saving of life; (7) for the preservation of 
chastity. These three belong to serviceable falsehoods. (8) Lastly come 
falsehoods uttered in order to please (as compliments, flattering 
remarks, etc.). They belong to the third class mentioned above.  
<!--
Qu. cx. 3.] VERACITY AND VICES OPPOSED TO IT. 383  
--><A NAME="p383"></a><p>

<i>Is every falsehood a sin?</i><p>

Falsehood is evil in itself, being contrary to the law of nature; for 
signs are naturally so connected with things signified that it is 
unnatural and wrong to signify what one has not in his mind. "He that 
uttereth lies shall not escape" (Prov. xix. 5). <p>

(1) Are examples of falsehood in Holy Scripture ever spoken of therein 
with commendation? For example, the midwives in Egypt told a downright 
lie with intention to deceive (Ex. i. 21). But they had their reward 
with God, not for their lie, but for their godly fear and benevolence. 
Examples of perfect virtue may be found in Holy Scripture; but some 
are commended there (as Jaci, the wife of Heher the Kenite), not for 
perfect virtue, but for a virtuous disposition, which was sullied with 
many imperfections. (Yet, to the best of her knowledge, Jaci was on the 
Lord's side against the enemies of the Lord's elected people.) <p>

(2) It may be said that a less evil is to be chosen in order to avoid a 
greater one; and there is less harm done in generating a false 
impression in the mind of another than in killing or being killed. 
Therefore it is lawful to lie in order to keep one man from homicide, 
and to save another from death. But the lie is sin not merely from the 
harm done to a neighbour, but from its own violation of God's order. 
"Speak ye truth each one with his neighbour; for we are members one of 
another" (Eph. iv. 25). And it is not permitted to use any illicit 
violation of Divine order in order to hinder the doing of injury. So it 
is not permitted to steal in order to have something to give away. 
Therefore, it is not lawful to tell a lie in order to liberate another 
from some peril. But it is lawful prudently to keep back the truth. <p>

(3) It may be said, also, that it is a falsehood if one does not fulfil 
what he has promised; but not all promises are to be fulfilled; evil 
ones should be violated, and, therefore, not every falsehood is a sin. 
But he who promises anything with the intention of keeping his promise 
does not tell a 
<!--
384 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. cx. 4. 
--><A NAME="p384"></a>
 falsehood, for he does not speak contrary to what he has in his 
heart. If he does not do what he has promised, he seems to be acting 
faithlessly in changing his mind. But he is excusable, first, if he 
have promised what is manifestly unlawful; he sinned in promising, he 
does well in changing his purpose. Next, he is excusable if the 
condition of persons and things be altered. A man is bound to do what 
he has promised provided that all important conditions remain 
unchanged. Otherwise, he was neither false in promising, because he 
promised what he had in his mind, the due conditions being understood; 
nor is he faithless in not doing what he promised, because those 
conditions no longer exist. <p>

(4) Compliments, and other <i>mendacia jocosa</i>, have the nature of 
falsehood as acts, for there is the will to utter what is known to be 
false; but there may be no intention to deceive, and no actual 
deception may be produced.  <p>

<i>Is every falsehood a mortal sin?</i><p>

Mortal sin is properly what is opposed to charity whereby the soul 
lives in union with God. But a falsehood may be opposed to charity in 
three ways (1) First, in itself, as signifying what is untrue. If this 
regard Divine things, it is opposed to the love of God, whose truth is 
hidden or corrupted by such a falsehood. This is not only opposed to 
charity, but to faith and religion, and this falsehood is, therefore, 
most grave, and is mortal. But if the false expression concern that 
whose knowledge pertains to man's good -- <i>e.g.</i>, to the 
perfection of knowledge and instruction concerning the moral life -- 
such a falsehood, causing loss to one's neighbour through false 
opinion, is opposed to love of our neighbour, and is mortal sin. But if 
the false opinion thus produced concern something which is indifferent, 
where it matters not whether it be known or not, then a neighbour 
suffers no loss from such a falsehood; <i>e.g.</i>, if one were 
deceived in small, contingent particulars with which he 
<!--
Qu. cx. 4.] VERACITY AND VICES OPPOSED TO IT. 385 
--><A NAME="p385"></a>
 had no concern. Such a falsehood, viewed in itself, is not a mortal 
sin. <p>

(2) By reason of the end aimed at a falsehood may be opposed to 
charity, as when what is said is intended to do injury to God's honour, 
or other attribute of His, which is contrary to religion and is always 
mortal sin; or when it is intended to injure our neighbour's property, 
person, or good name; and this, also, like any wilful injury of 
another, is mortal sin. By merely intending to do what is mortal sin, 
one sins mortally. But if the end aimed at be not contrary to charity, 
the falsehood will not, so viewed, be mortal sin, as is apparent in 
complimentary remarks, and some "white lies" which are intended for 
some benefit to a friend. (This does not imply that they are no sin, 
but that they are not that deadly sin which destroys the spiritual 
life.) <p>

(3) Accidentally, even such a lesser sin may be contrary to charity by 
reason of the scandal given to others, or some resulting harm which 
will make even a "white lie" to become mortal sin. <p>

(1) But the Psalmist says (Ps. v. 6), "Thou shalt destroy them that 
speak lies." This, no doubt, is said of those who are injuring others 
by their falsehoods. <p>

(2) Is not every kind of falsehood prohihited by the Ninth Commandment? 
Since all the precepts of the Decalogue are reducible to the love of 
God and our neighbour, falsehood is so far against the Ninth 
Commandment as it is contrary to charity. Hence, "bearing false witness 
against our neighbour" is explicitly named. <p>

(3) But it is to he remembered that Venial sin is iniquity, being 
against just equity; therefore S. Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i. 
36), "Every one who utters a falsehood violates confidence; for he 
certainly wishes that another whom he tries to deceive have confidence 
in him, which confidence he violates. But every violator of trust is 
iniquitous." (So the apostle, Eph. iv. 25. And note that the argument 
applies with force to beneficial lies (<i>mend.
<!--
386 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. cxi. 1, 2, 4. 
--><A NAME="p386"></a>
 officiosa</i>), which are violations of fidelity, if not directly of 
charity.)  <p>

<i>Simulation and hypocrisy. -- All simulation is sinful.</i><p>

For we have seen that veracity is the virtue by which one presents 
himself outwardly through external signs such as he inwardly is. But 
these signs are not only words but actions also. As, then, it is 
opposed to the virtue of veracity that one express in words what is not 
in his heart, it is equally so to make use of outward things or actions 
for the same purpose. This simulation is an acted falsehood. And since 
every falsehood is a sin, every simulation is a sin (under the same 
conditions). <p>

As it is not falsehood to be lawfully silent respecting what actually 
exists, so it is not simulation to fail to signify in other manners 
than by words what actually is. Thus it is not the sin of simulation to 
conceal a sin, for fear of scandal given to others.  <p>

All hypocrisy is simulation, but not all simulation is hypocrisy, but 
only that which simulates another's person, as when the sinner pretends 
that he is a just man. He wears a mask, as the name hypocrite 
indicates. <p>

But it may be objected that the hypocrites of the Gospel when they were 
giving alms showed outwardly what they were inwardly doing (S. Matt. 
vi. 2). I answer that the outward action naturally signifies the 
intention. When, therefore, in good works which naturally pertain to 
God's service, any one does not seek to please God, but to please men, 
he feigns a right intention which he does not possess.  <p>

<i>Is hypocrisy always mortal sin?</i><p>

The hypocrite of the Gospel is a mortal sinner, for he has two vices, 
defect of sanctity, and simulation of it; and his aim is both these 
vices; that is, he does not care to be <p>

<!--
Qu. cxii. 1, 2.] VERACITY AND VICES OPPOSED TO IT. 387 
--><A NAME="p387"></a>
 holy, but only seeks to appear such. This is mortal sin; for no one is 
totally deprived of holiness except through mortal sin. But if he who 
conceals his sin, and therefore intentionally feigns a holiness which 
he does not possess, be called a hypocrite, his sin indeed may be 
mortal, but the act of simulation is not an added mortal sin. <p>

This you may see from considering the end aimed at. If the simulation 
be opposed to the love of God or one's neighhour, say, that the end is 
to spread heresy abroad, or to get office in the Church when one is 
unfit for it, or money, or reputation, as the end of the hypocrisy, any 
of these or the like makes the sin evidently mortal. <p>

But if the feigning were out of pure vanity (<i>e.g.</i>, delighting in 
the clerical garb without reference to the sanctity which it 
symbolizes and requires), sinful as it is, it may possibly not destroy 
totally the love of God in thc soul; that is, it may be venial sin.  <p>

<i>Boasting (<i>"jactantia"</i>), and its opposite vice 
(<i>"ironia"</i>), self-depreciation.</i> <p>

There are two kinds of boasting, or extolling one's self in words. One 
may speak of himself not, indeed, above what he is in truth, but above 
men's opinion of him, which sort of boasting the apostle disclaims in 2 
Cor. xii. 6. But in another way one may extol himself above what he 
truly is, and this is more properly boasting, and is manifestly a vice 
opposed to truth. <p>

Perhaps its most frequent cause is the arrogance of pride, elevating 
one inwardly above his measure, and finding outward expression in 
boastful words, although personal vanity may produce the same result. 
Its end is vainglory or worldly gain.  <p>

<i>Is it mortal sin?</i><p>

As a form of falsehood it is sometimes directed against the glory of 
God, like the boasting of the Prince of Tyre (Ezek. xxviii. 2). 
Sometimes it is opposed to love of our 
<!--
388 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. cxiv. 
--><A NAME="p388"></a>
 neighbour, like the Pharisee's boasting in S. Luke xviii. 11, "God, I 
thank Thee that I am not as the rest of men," etc. These are mortal 
sins (Ps. xii. 3). <p>

But sometimes one boasts out of idle vanity, neither against God nor 
against his neighbour; this is sinful, but it may be venial sin. But, 
again, we may consider its cause, as pride, lust of gain, or vainglory; 
and if its cause be deadly sin, so will be the boasting from that 
cause. The lust of gain may lead to boasts for the purpose of deceiving 
and causing loss. This is deadly sin. <p>

And, again, the vanity which produces it may set one's self above God's 
love, or lead to contempt of Divine commands. This will make the 
apparently harmless boasting a deadly evil.  <p>

<i>Self-depreciation ("ironia").</i><p>

There are two kinds of this also. One may be truly veracious, while he 
is reticent respecting the better things which he knows to be in 
himself, but discloses the faults which he knows that he has. This in 
itself is not sin, though the circumstances may make it such. <p>

But, also, one may decline from truth in asserting some vile thing of 
himself which he does not recognize to be in him, or denying some good 
thing which he perceives that he possesses. This is the sin which, for 
lack of a better word, I have called <i>"ironia."</i> <p>

It is no excuse for this sin that we are avoiding the opposite sin of 
self-exaltation, or pride.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 5. Affability and liberality, with their opposite vices.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup></h4><p>

I mean by affalility that courtesy or friendliness by which 
<!--
Qu. cxv.] AFFABILITY AND LIBERALITY. 389 
--><A NAME="p389"></a>
 a man becomingly orders his intercourse with other men in words and 
deeds. It is a special virtue of outward conduct even towards 
strangers. <p>

It is a part of justice, or a virtue annexed to justice, for though 
there is here no question of a debt of legal obligation, there is a 
moral obligation on the part of a virtuous man to treat others in a 
becoming way. <p>

Since man is by nature "a social animal," it is a law of nature not 
only that he preserve fidelity in his relations to his fellows, but 
that he take all pains to make his fellowship a source of pleasure to 
others; for pleasure as well as veracity is essential to human 
intercourse. The exception is when for some good cause it is necessary 
to produce beneficially the opposite feeling in men with whom we have 
to do; say, when some good is to be accomplished or some evil avoided 
by blame, etc.  <p>

<i>Adulation.</i><p>

One may attempt on all occasions to use flattering words, either for 
his own profit, or simply for the purpose of giving pleasure to 
another. The motive or other circumstances will determine whether or 
not the praising others is a sin. One may wish to console in trouble by 
giving pleasure, or to help another's progress in good; and, other due 
conditions being observed, this may pertain to the virtue of 
friendliness. But it will be the vice of adulation if one praise 
another for that which is not laudable, or is, perhaps, positively 
wrong; or if by doing so he incite to vainglory; or if his flattery aim 
at some personal advantage for himself.  <p>

Flattery is sometimes a mortal sin, and sometimes a sin not so deadly. 
It is mortal whenever it is contrary to charity, as when what is sinful 
is praised; for this is contrary both to the love of God and to the 
love of our neighbour. Again, it is mortal by reason 
<!--
390 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. cxvii. 
--><A NAME="p390"></a>
 of the intention; as when one flatters another in order to injure him 
fraudulently either in body or in soul. Again, adulation may give to 
another occasion to sin even without any such direct intention. And 
then it will be necessary to consider whether the occasion was actually 
given, or merely taken, and also what kind of injury resulted. The 
question is like that of scandal, which has already been considered 
(page 254). <p>

But if one, simply out of an eagerness to give pleasure to others, use 
flattering language, or even if its object be to avoid some evil, or to 
obtain some needed good, the adulation is not against charity, and the 
sin will stand on the same footing with other falsehoods of similar 
character.  <p>

<i>Unfriendliness, captiousness, moroseness ("litigium").</i> <p>

Contradicting others may be due to discord, when one refuses to assent 
to what another says on account of a want of charity towards him. But, 
again, one may contradict another from a general moroseness which has 
no hesitation in making one's self disagreeable. This is opposed to 
that virtue which we have named affability. <p>

This form of contentiousness is, in itself, a graver sin than flattery, 
although the injurious motive may make adulation a more sinful thing. 
That which is baser in human actions is not always the graver sin. For 
the glory of man is his reason; and therefore carnal sins, by which the 
flesh gets lordship over reason, are more degrading than spiritual 
sins; although these are graver, because there is more contempt of God 
in them. Similarly, sins which have guile in them are baser, although 
open sins may sometimes contain more contempt of God. So it happens 
that guileful adulation seems to be baser, although quarrelsomeness 
seems to be graver.  <p>

<i>Liberality.</i><p>

Liberality is the virtue by which we use well the things 
<!--
Qu. cxvii. 5.] AFFABILITY AND LIBERALITY. 391 
--><A NAME="p391"></a>
 of this world which are granted to us for the support of our earthly 
life. <p>

(1) Natural inclination, indeed, leads each one to provide for himself 
rather than for others. But this is not contrary to the virtue of 
liberality, because a very little suffices for one person, and also the 
liberal man does not so provide for others that he neglects himself and 
those belonging to him. He uses money, and whatever can be measured by 
money, not as throwing it away in prodigal fashion, but judiciously 
securing, first, provision for his own support and for what is needful 
for executing his virtuous works. <p>

(2) The prodigal is not to be regarded as a liberal man, because he 
does not follow the dictates of right reason as virtue does. And, on 
the other hand, the virtuous poor may be liberal, because the virtue 
does not consist in a multitude of gifts, but in the virtuous affection 
of the giver (Nic. Eth. iv. 1). <p>

Those passions which are concerned with money or its equivalent are the 
immediate subject of liberality, as love of riches, desire for them, 
pleasure in them, sorrow at parting with them. Liberality hinders any 
inordinate affection for money from preventing the due use of it. But 
this due use is two-fold; first, for the owner's expenses; next, for 
others through gifts to them. The liberal man is free in his 
expenditure, free in convenient gifts. <p>

But, of course, the virtue is far greater which leads to the giving 
than that which leads to the expending.  <p>

Liberality is not, properly speaking, a part of justice, because the 
latter returns to another what is his; but liberality bestows what is 
its own. <p>

Yet there is a certain relation between them; first, because they are 
both primarily relative to another; and secondly, because they are both 
concerned with external things. 
<!--
392 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. CXVIII. 1.  
--><A NAME="p392"></a><p>

Liberality, also, is not concerned with legal debt as justice is, but 
it recognizes a moral obligation. <p>

Beneficence and pity also give, but their giving proceeds from some 
special affection towards its object, and therefore such giving 
pertains to charity or friendship. But liberal giving is due to a 
special affection with regard to money which is neither inordinately 
desired nor loved. Hence the giving is not only to friends or to the 
suffering.  <p>

<i>Is liberality chief among virtues?</i> <p>

Every virtue is directed to some good; and the greater the good, the 
greater the virtue. But primarily and <i>per se</i> liberality directs 
the soul with respect to the possession and the use of money. This 
places it below such virtues as temperance, which govern bodily 
concupiscences and pleasures; and below courage and justice, which are 
ordained for the common good; and still more below those virtues which 
are ordained for Divine good. This is the order first, Divine good; 
then, the common good; then, private good of soul, of body, and, 
lastly, private good in outward things. <p>

But liberality may be directed to any or to all of these, and so it 
will have a secondary excellence as useful for many things. <p>

God, indeed, "giveth to all men Liberally, and upbraideth not" (S. Jas. 
i. 5); but this Divine giving comes from Divine love, not from such 
mode of regarding external goods as enters into our definition of 
liberality in man.  <p>

<i>Avarice: is it a sin?</i><p>

God's Word says (Heb. xiii. 5), "Be ye free from the love of money; 
content with such things as ye have." In everything the good requires a 
due measure, and evil comes from going beyond or falling short of that 
measure. This applies to all things which exist for a certain end; they 
<!--
Qu. CXVIII. 1.] AVARICE. 393 
--><A NAME="p393"></a>
 must be commensurate with that end, as medicine with reference to 
recovery of health. <p>

But outward goods are things useful for some end; and therefore, 
necessarily, the good of man, so far as they are concerned, consists in 
a certain measure, a man seeking to have them so far as they are 
necessary for his life according to his condition in the world. <p>

Therefore there is sin in going beyond or falling short of this 
measure, when, namely, one beyond or within the due mode wishes to 
acquire or to keep outward riches. Avarice is immoderate love of 
possession. Therefore it is a sin. <p>

(1) The desire of external things is natural to man, but as means to an 
end. It is therefore free from sin so far as it falls under a rule 
derived from its end. But avarice exceeds this rule. <p>

(2) But is it sin against God, against self, or against our neighbour? 
It may be against all three; for it implies disordination outward or 
inward. The getting or the keeping of riches may be directly sin 
against our neighbour, when one man superabounds in wealth through the 
poverty of many others. <p>

Or, again, the lust of riches, immoderate love of them or pleasure in 
them, is a sin of man against himself, because his inward affections 
are disordered. <p>

And avarice, like any other mortal sin, is against God, inasmuch as man 
for the sake of temporal good despises the eternal good. <p>

(3) It is true that the old, on account of failing powers, do naturally 
seek the aid of external things, like any other needy persons (Nic. 
Eth. iv. 1); but natural inclinations are to he governed by reason, and 
the aged are not free from sin if they exceed reason's due measure. <p>

The special sin is the inordinate seeking of a special good; Sc., 
riches as numbered among the goods useful to man (Rom. i. 29). <p>

Avarice may be opposed to justice in the getting and 
<!--
394 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. 
--><A NAME="p394"></a>
 keeping riches against the rights of others; but when we consider the 
inward affection, the immoderate lust for riches, even apart from any 
wish to plunder from others, there is the sin of avarice plainly 
opposed to liberality. It neglects not the legal debt of justice, hut 
the moral debt of reason.  <p>

<i>Is avarice always mortal sin?</i><p>

When opposed to justice it is mortal sin, for it involves unjustly 
taking or keeping what is another's. But, like theft (see page 304), 
the imperfection of the act may make it venial. <p>

But, as opposed to liberality, avarice implies inordinate love of 
riches. And if this so increase that it is set above charity, so that 
through love of riches one does not fear to act against the love of God 
and his neighbour, avarice is mortal sin (Rom. i. 29). <p>

But if the inordinate love keep within this, so that it is not 
preferred to Divine love, and one is not willing to do anything against 
God or his neighbour for the sake of riches, avarice is venial sin. <p>

The lust of riches darkens the soul whenever it excludes the light of 
charity.<p>

<i>Is avarice the greatest of sins?</i><p>

Every sin, because it is evil, consists in some corruption or privation 
of some good; but, as it is voluntary, it consists in the desire of 
some good. So the relative gravity of sins may be viewed in two ways; 
first, as regards the good which is despised or corrupted; the greater 
that good, the graver is the sin. In this way the sin which is against 
God is the greatest of all sins; next to that, the sin against the 
person of man; after that, sin respecting outward things which are 
intended for man's service, among which sins is avarice. <p>

But, in another way, the grade of sins may be viewed ac<!--
Qu. cxviii. 6, 7, 8.] AVARICE. 395  
 --><A NAME="p395"></a>cording to the good to which human appetite is inordinately 
subject. The less that good, the more shameful is the sin. But external 
goods are the lowest that man can obtain; less than corporeal goods, 
which, again, are less than the good of the soul, which is exceeded by 
Divine good. Thus viewed, avarice has the greatest deformity. But since 
the corruption or privation of good is the essence, the "formal part" 
of sin, and since the conversion to transitory good is the "material 
part," the gravity of sins depends rather on the first than on the 
second. Therefore avarice is not simply the greatestof all sins. <p>

Yet avarice has its own special danger; <i>sc.</i>, that it is most 
difficult to be eradicated from the soul, always increasing with 
increasing age and need of outward help.  <p>

<i>Avarice is a spiritual, not a carnal, sin.</i> <p>

Sins are rooted in the affections or passions of the soul, and they are 
consummated in its pleasures and pains. Some of these pleasures are 
carnal, some are spiritual; and those are called fleshly sins which are 
completed in fleshly pleasures; those are spiritual sins which are 
completed in spiritual pleasures resulting from apprehension of the 
mind. And such a sin is avarice. <p>

It has a material object, indeed, but the pleasure is not corporeal but 
mental. The sin, however, may be said to have an intermediate place 
between purely spiritual sins, like pride, and purely fleshly sins, 
like lust or gluttony.  <p>

<i>Avarice is a capital sin.</i> <p>

Sins are so called which, being viewed as an end, originate other 
vices. Now the end most of all sought for is felicity, which riches 
promise in offering what is sufficient for all needs. As all pleasures 
can be purchased, or seem purchasable, money virtually appears to 
contain them all, and so its possession seems to be the height of 
felicity, and so originate 
<!--
396 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. cxix. 2.  
--><A NAME="p396"></a>
 the daughters of avarice; viz., treachery, fraud, deceitful words, 
perjury, restlessness of soul, violence, hardness of heart.  <p>

<i>Prodigality.</i><p>

Prodigality is the vice which is opposite to avarice. The avaricious 
loves riches to excess, but the prodigal lacks due care for what is an 
earthly means to a well-ordered life. The prodigal goes to excess in 
giving, but falls short of duty in getting and preserving, while the 
avaricious, on the contrary, fails in giving, but goes to excess in 
getting and in keeping. <p>

The prodigal son (S. Luke xv. 13), "wasted his substance in riotous 
living." And so prodigality may seem to be opposed to a temperate and 
continent manner of life. And this is most frequently the case. But 
prodigality as such may be directed to other evil ends, or it may be 
the mere indifference to riches which leads to wasting them. So it is 
directly opposed to avarice.  <p>

<i>Is prodigality a sin?</i><p>

Virtue is corrupted by defect as well as by excess. And although the 
apostle said that the inordinate "love of money is the root of all 
evils" (1 Tim. vi. 10), that does not imply that all evils always 
spring from avarice, but that there is no evil which does not sometimes 
originate in that capital sin. Even prodigality sometimes originates 
there, as when one prodigally wastes many things in order to win the 
favour of others, and to get a larger return. <p>

When the apostle (1 Tim. vi. 17) said, "Charge them that are rich in 
this present world, that they be ready to distribute," he spoke of 
giving according to duty, which is precisely what the prodigal does 
not. Prodigality is not liberality. For the excess of the former is not 
a question of mere quantity in giving, but rather of going beyond duty 
<!--
Qu. cxx.] EQUITY. 397 
--><A NAME="p397"></a>
 and propriety. The liberal sometimes gives more than the prodigal, if 
it he necessary to make large gifts. <p>

Prodigality, considered in itself, is not so grave a sin as avarice. 
For, first, it is not so far away from the virtue of liberality, which 
also freely gives. Secondly, the prodigal is useful to many by giving 
to them; the avaricious is useful to none, not even to himself. And, 
lastly, prodigality, as such, is far more easily cured, both by 
advancing age, by losing what has been wasted, and by the easy 
transition from this vice to liberality; whereas avarice is rarely 
cured. <p>

Both of them sin against others and against themselves. The prodigal 
sins against himself in wasting what is useful to himself, and against 
others in consuming what ought to be properly dispensed for the needy. 
And this is conspicuously true of the clergy, if they expend on 
themselves in luxuries or in pleasures what ought to be bestowed for 
the needy and for the Church. <p>

The avaricious also sins against his neighbour and against himself; but 
while the prodigal may do good to some one, the avaricious benefits 
neither others nor himself, because he does not dare to use his goods 
even for his own benefit.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 6. Equity ("epicheia").</h4><p>

Human acts, concerning which laws are promulgated, can vary infinitely; 
and therefore it is not possible that any rule of law should be 
instituted fitted to all cases which may occur. Legislators are obliged 
to fit their laws to what generally occurs, but in some cases keeping 
to the letter of the law would be contrary to the equality of justice, 
and to the common good which is the aim of the law. Thus, law decrees 
that deposits shall be returned to their owner, because this is 
ordinarily just. But it may be injurious; <i>e.g.</i>, an insane person 
may demand a revolver which he has left with you, or a rebel may demand 
what he intends to use against the people. In such cases it is evil to 
follow the letter of the 
<!--
398 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. cxxii. 1. 
--><A NAME="p398"></a>
 law, and it is right to do what the law intended and the common good 
demands. This is the virtue of equity. <p>

(1) This is not judging the law instead of judging by it. For he judges 
the law who says that it is not a good law. But he who says that the 
law does not apply in the particular case in question, judges of that 
case. <p>

(2) In doubt concerning the meaning of the law, the interpretation of 
the law-makers or of the court having jurisdiction must stand. But 
where the case is plain there is no need of interpreting, but only of 
applying. <p>

Equity is a part of justice viewed in its widest signification; but it 
is a "higher law," directive of legal justice.  <p>

S. Thomas Aquinas regards the Spiritual gift of "godliness," or 
<i>"pietas,"</i> as perfective of natural religion. As the other 
Spiritual gifts are habitual dispositions of the soul making us prompt 
to be moved by the Holy Ghost, so this gift produces a filial 
disposition towards God. "Ye received the spirit of adoption, whereby 
we cry, Abba, Father" (Rom. viii. 15). To worship God as Creator and 
Lord belongs to religion; but to draw near to God as our Father in 
heaven is through the inspiring gift of the Holy Ghost. <p>

Nor this alone; for the same gift prompts to honour all that belongs in 
special manner to the Father. It honours the saints; it listens with 
reverence to the Holy Scriptures; it succours the needy as children of 
the same Father.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 7. The precepts of justice: the Ten Commandments.</h4><p>

The Decalogue contains the primal principles of law, to which natural 
reason at once assents as most manifest principles. The first four 
commandments refer to the acts of religion as the highest part of 
justice; the fifth to piety, which stands next to religion; the others 
to justice in general as applied to our equals. <p>

(1) The law aims at making all men virtuous, but it begins with 
manifest obligations of duty. 
<!--
Qu. cxxii. 2, 8.] THE PRECEPTS OF JUSTICE. 399  
--><A NAME="p399"></a><p>

(2) The judicial precepts of the Old Law are determinations of its 
moral precepts towards our neighbour, as its ceremonial precepts are of 
the moral precepts towards God. <p>

(3) The Ten Commandments have charity as their end (1 Tim. i. 5); but 
they directly command just acts.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup>  <p>

<i>The First and Second Commandments.</i><p>

Why do they begin the Decalogue? Since the law's aim is to make good 
men, consider the order of the process. It must begin with the will; 
but the goodness of that depends upon its end; and God is that ultimate 
end. And, first of all, impediments must be removed out of the way of 
true religion, and the chief impediment is the worship of false gods -- 
"Ye cannot serve God and Mammon" (S. Matt. vi. 24). When those 
impediments are removed by negative precepts, then can come the 
positive law of religion in the Fourth Commandment.  <p>

<i>The Third Gommandment.</i> <p>

Not only superstition is an impediment to true religion which must be 
removed out of the way. Irreligion, defect of reverence by which God is 
despised, is an impediment. Superstition has substituted some other 
object in place of God. But irreligion, professing to receive Him, robs 
Him of His due honour. <p>

(1) Not every assumption of the Holy Name is forbidden, 
<!--
400 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. cxxii. 4. 
--><A NAME="p400"></a>
 but false oaths, whether assertory or promissory, false vows, etc. <p>

(2) Not only swearing falsely is taking God's name in vain, but also 
swearing truly, without judgment, in levity, etc. <p>

(3) The more common sins are specified; and vain swearing is more 
common than blasphemy, though the latter is equally prohibited.  <p>

<i>The Fourth Commandment.</i><p>

The impediments to true religion having been removed, then comes the 
precept of true religion which worships God. And as inward worship is 
presented to us in Holy Scripture under corporeal similitudes, so the 
outward worship of God is presented through some sensible sign of it. 
Man is led to the inward worship of prayer and devotion by the inward 
guidance of the Holy Ghost; but the precept of the law is given 
concerning outward worship in its sensible sign, a sign of the common 
benefit of the Creation, which ended on the day of rest. <p>

(1) Literally taken, the precept is partly moral, partly ceremonial. It 
is moral in requiring that man set aside some part of his life for 
Divine things. The natural reason which sets aside some time for 
recreation, etc., also demands some time for spiritual refection. So 
far the Fourth Commandment is moral. <p>

But in determining a particular time as a sign of the Creation, it is 
ceremonial. It is ceremonial also in its allegorical signification, 
pointing to Christ's Sabbath rest in the new tomb. It is ceremonial 
also in its moral signification of the soul's rest in God. As moral, 
not as ceremonial, this commandment takes its place in the Decalogue. <p>

(2) Distinguish the end, the having time for Divine service, and the 
rest from servile work. The service of God was not servile work; 
therefore circumcision (S. John vii. 23), and the priests' and Levites' 
work, on the Sabbath were not prohibited (S. Matt. xii. 5). 
<!--
Qu. cxxii. 5.] THE PRECEPTS OF JUSTICE. 401  
--><A NAME="p401"></a>
 But other works are contrary to the observance of the Sabbath 
inasmuch as they impede our attending to Divine things. <p>

There are also corporal works not pertaining to God's service which are 
not properly servile, because they are common to all, both servants 
and masters. Thus every one, servant or not, is bound to provide in 
necessary things not only for himself but for his neighbour, especially 
what concerns the support of life or the avoiding of great loss (Deut. 
xxii. 1; S. John vii. 23; S. Matt. xii. 2). <p>

(3) The observance of the Lord's Day under the Gospel law takes the 
place of the Sabbath, not by force of the precept of the Old Law, but 
by the authority of the Church and Christian custom. The Lord's Day is 
not figurative like the Sabbath. No such strict prohibition of work, 
therefore, belongs to it. Cooking food was prohibited; it is now 
allowed, etc. And needful dispensation, even in what is prohibited by 
the Church, is more readily obtained under the Gospel's easy burden.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup>  
The Fifth Commandment. <p>

The end of the Decalogue is love of God and our neighbour. But among 
neighbours parents hold the highest place. Therefore this commandment 
heads the second table; but since parents are the source of our being, 
it holds close affinity with the first table, and some -- <i>e.g.</i>, 
Josephus and Philo -- have placed it there. <p>

(1) Parents take the precedence of other relatives and of our country. 
Nevertheless, in this precept is understood whatever pertains to 
rendering due honour to others according to their rightful claim. <p>

(2) Reverential honour is due to parents as such in every case; but 
there are special duties in special cases, like support in time of 
need, which are implied in the general law. 
<!--
402 DUTIES TOWARDS OTHERS. [Qu. cxxii. 6.  
--><A NAME="p402"></a><p>

<i>The last five commandments.</i> <p>

These pertain to justice in general, which gives all indifferently 
their due. <p>

(1) Why are they all negative? Why is there no affirmative precept? Man 
is always and universally bound to do no harm to any one; and so the 
commandments prohibit it. But positive duties to our neighbours vary 
with person, time, place, etc.; therefore they do not appear in these 
universal laws. <p>

(2) Are there not many other injuries beside homicide, adultery, theft, 
and false witness? Why are only these specified? These are chief in 
their respective classes, and the others are reducible to these. Thus, 
all injury to the person of our neighbour is included in homicide, as 
the chief injury; wrongful deeds of lust against others, and especially 
against those connected with us, are included in adultery; injurious 
actions towards others' property are embraced in theft; and, finally, 
injurious words, detractions, blasphemies, and the like, are prohibited 
along with false witness. <p>

(3) In the Tenth Commandment, which prohibits concupiscence, are not 
included the first motions of it, which spring from our fallen, 
sensuous nature; but the consent of the will is forbidden, consent 
whether to the deed or to the pleasure of it. <p>

(4) Concupiscence leading to theft or adultery is expressly prohibited, 
and not that (wrath, etc.) which leads to homicide, because that in 
itself does not present itself as a desirable or useful thing, like 
adultery or theft.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<hr><p>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a></a> The English language, and the English-speaking races, so far as 
their language expresses their moral thought, seem to stand on a higher  
plane than the Latin language, and the nations using its derivatives. 
For our two words, "falsehood" and "lie," express moral differences 
which are lost or blended in <i>mendacium</i>. The lie, as we use the 
word, seems to imply the intention to deceive and to call a man a liar 
is the gravest insult, because we impute an evil intention which we can 
only infer. But the falsehood may be uttered without that intention, 
through ignorance, or carelessness, or in joke. Falsehood, therefore, 
seems to come nearer than the stronger word, "lie," to 
"<i>mendacium</i>" as the term is used hy S. Thomas Aquinas. <p>

<a name="n_2"><a href="#n2">{2}</a></a> Note here and throughout this work that a moral deterioration in the 
English language is found in the use of the term "vice." Originally it 
was any habit of sin, and the word is so used throughout this manual of 
Moral Theology. But popular use has lowered the word, morally speaking, 
to any habit supposed in any way whatsoever to be injurious; say, the 
"vice" of using tobacco. <p>

<a name="n_3"><a href="#n3">{3}</a></a> Our author, following S. Augustine, as the Roman and Lutheran 
communions of modern times also do, places three commandments in the 
first table, uniting into one the first and second, as the English and 
American Church divide them. Polytheism and idolatry are thus 
prohibited in one commandment. And there are good ethical reasons for 
this arrangement according to the author's system. Superstition is 
prohibited in all its forms in the First. irreligion in all its forms 
in the Second, Commandment. The reasons for separating polytheism from 
idolatry need not here be stated. Let it suffice to note that idolatry, 
not polytheism is one of the special dangers of a superstitions part 
of the Christian Church itself. Throughout this manual the  
commandments are numbered as the Anglican Church numbers them.<p>
