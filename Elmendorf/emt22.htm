<h3>CHAPTER III.  SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.</h3><p>

THE Divine law in its primary applications, as given in the Ten 
Commandments, has been so fully presented in our text from S. Thomas 
Aquinas that only a few words of practical application need be added. 
But the student will not overlook that admirable expansion of those 
commandments, so serviceable also for self-examination by them, which 
is contained in the Church Catechism.<p>

<i>The First and Second Commandments</i> concern faith, holy fear, love 
and worship towards God. (See Part III., page 399.)<p>

On the sin of simony, Jesuitical distinctions concerning it, and the 
making pay a motive for the priest's work, see the twelfth Provincial 
Letter of Pascal, with the defence of it, usually appended to "Les 
Provinciales." The test for conscience may be to ask how the work is 
done. Is it with equal zeal, labour, and love where no earthly 
recompense can be expected?  <p>

On the <i>Third Commandment</i>, see Part III., page 399. <p>

"Curses," "swearing," as ordinarily heard, need not be always regarded 
as mortal sin in themselves, for charity will presume that there is 
absence of intention. Commonly, among us, at least, they may be 
indications of a profane spirit, and habits of other and mortal sins. 
But in this matter it would not be wise to overlook the very different 
associations of different classes, and the very different customs of 
different European nations. <p>

In oaths, assertory or promissory, there must be lawful matter; 
otherwise they create no obligation. Furthermore, 
<!--
THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT. 511 
--><A NAME="p511"></a>
 the implied conditions in a promissory oath are (a) that no serious 
injury will be done in observing it; (b) that there shall be no 
serious change of circumstances; (c) that the other party shall 
observe this pledge also; and (d) that he will not give up his claim to 
the fulfilment of the oath. Perjury, in common law, is crime only in 
judicial proceedings, and in what is material to the case in question 
(Blackst. iv. page 137).  <p>

<i>The Fourth Commandment</i>. Giving time for Divine worship is a law 
of nature. But since the ceremonial law of ancient Israel has been 
abolished, the observance of Sundays, together with other feasts and 
fasts of obligation, rests upon positive ecclesiastical law (Duct. 
Dubitant. II. ii. rule 6). Such law is found in canons 13, 14, and 15, 
&sect;&sect; 43, <i>et seq.</i>, of 1603 (respecting "the Lord's Day, 
commonly called Sunday, and other holy-days,". . . "such days as are 
appointed to be kept holy by the book of Common Prayer," etc.), and 
title i., canon 18, of the American Church. The law is (a) affirmative, 
as in these canons; i.e., binding under due conditions. Grave injury to 
body or soul is full excuse from the outward obligations of such a law; 
<i>e.g.</i>, for harvesters in case of need; the sickly and nurses of the 
sick; travellers on long voyages by land or sea; those who are engaged 
in cooking, mothers in charge of infants, and domestic servants; those 
who reside at great distance from church, etc., etc. <p>

(b) The law is negative in requiring abstinence from unnecessary 
servile work. But to this must in practice be added the obligation of 
abstaining from what causes scandal, especially where Judaizing notions 
are prevalent, and from what tends to sin, seeking what promotes 
spiritual edification. <p>

With this limitation, it cannot well be maintained that liberal works 
or recreations of any honest sort are prohibited by the law. At the 
same time, we have no right, under the law of charity, to make our 
recreations a cause of servile work and of the neglect of holy time on 
the part of others. 
<!--
512 NOTES ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.  
 --><A NAME="p512"></a>
The common servile work, duly limited in respect of time, such as 
cooking, sweeping, etc., is not a violation of the law. Servile work, 
also, for charity or piety is to be admitted without hesitation.  <p>

<i>The Fifth Commandment</i>. (See Part III., page 363.) The honour due 
to a father and a mother here stands for the various obligations which 
spring from the natural relations of human life. These are considered 
in various parts of our Moral Theology, and need not be now repeated. <p>

But let us add respecting children, that in the choice of a work for 
life, as well as in the choice of a partner for life in life's duties, 
they are not subject to their parents' will, because these are the 
appointed and natural means of their reaching the ultimate end of their 
existence. They are to serve God and do their duty "in that state of 
life unto which it shall please God," not their parents, "to call 
them." But the law of nature, as well as the common law, is not to be 
overlooked, which requires that in their work for life they shall not 
forget to provide for the support of aged parents in their time of 
need. <p>

Parents also have a negative on their children's choice, at least until 
full maturity is reached. And this will apply equally to the choice of 
Holy Orders as life's work, or to the "religious" life for girls. <p>

(Qu.: The child is converted, and parents oppose the receiving of the 
Christian sacraments?)  <p>

Parents may violate this commandment by their neglect of spiritual 
instruction and training, and of moderate correction. <p>

(Qu. 1. Suppose that husband or wife is an infidel and opposes those 
necessary things -- <i>e.g.</i>, Holy Baptism -- which are the blessings of 
children? Also, that the other parent devoutly seeks for the same? <p>

Qu. 2. May parents lawfully commit the care of their children to 
heretical schools?) 
<!--
THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT. 513 
--><A NAME="p513"></a> 
 The husband's special sins are neglect of his wife, tyranny towards 
the weaker partner, dissipating funds which are needed for family 
expenses. <p>

The wife's special sins are lack of Christian submission (Col. iii. 
18), irritating words, "scolding," needless provocation in general, 
exposing the husband's faults, etc. <p>

Caution: Let the priest beware of lending a ready ear to a wife's 
complaints, which many are so ready to pour into a pastor's ears, and 
of taking part in family quarrels, because there is usually fault on 
both sides; <i>e.g.</i>, among many, exasperating a drunken husband by 
"nagging" words instead of meeting him with patience and forgiveness. <p>

If the husband be negligent in providing for his family, the wife may 
justly expend, out of the common income, what is suitable for her 
station in life, what is necessary for children, and other domestic 
expenses. If, through the husband's excesses, the family's support be 
endangered, she is not morally obliged to consult him in her action. <p>

(Qu. 1. Debts are due at the husband's death, and she also and her 
little children must be provided for; which has the prior claim? <p>

Qu. 2. May investments be withdrawn from business, and released from 
claims of creditors, for her benefit? <p>

Qu. 3. Can parents justly cut off children, in case of a runaway match, 
from all inheritance, and expel forever from the family?)  <p>

The master's and employer's special duty is to make prompt and just 
payment, and to see that due time is provided for spiritual 
improvement, and for recreation. The servant's and employee's duty is 
to avoid slovenly work, work for self in hours which belong to the 
other, and using unlawfully, selling, or giving away that other's 
goods. <p>

(Qu.: Suppose that the servant or employee leave before the stipulated 
time expires, what is the moral obligation?
<!--
514 NOTES ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.  
--><A NAME="p514"></a>
 Certainly, if loss ensue thereby, there is no claim for 
pay; but suppose no serious loss?)  <p>

The Sixth Commandment. (See Part III., page 297.) This, of course, 
includes the grave sins of hatred, dissension, etc., which find their 
consummation in the malicious taking of human life. The law of nature 
is repeated in Revelation (Gen. ix. 6), "Whoso sheddeth man's blood, 
etc., for in the image of God made He man." <p>

But God, by His agents, may demand the life which He has given (Rom. 
xiii. 4, the ideal of civil government). <p>

Lynch law, therefore, in organized society is murder. <p>

Divine law, however, does not forbid, and human law makes it lawful, to 
protect one's own life and what is necessary to life, even at the cost 
of the life of the aggressor -- <i>e.g.</i>, the burglar -- provided 
that no other means will serve the purpose. Charity may demand the same 
course in defence of one's neighbour against the unjust aggressor. <p>

Manifest limitations of this natural right are (1) He who takes what is 
not necessary to life is not lawfully killed; (2) no such injury shall 
be done after the aggression. That would be revenge, not lawful defence 
(Blackst., iii. page 3). <p>

Common law accords so strictly with the spirit of this commandment that 
it may be well to note its distinctions. Homicide is -<p>

(1) Justifiable in order to save life or limb, but not universally in 
order to save property. Special cases under common law, making homicide 
justifiable, are, (a) in case of arrest for felony, the accused taking 
flight or resisting; but it is murder to kill a felon without due 
process of law; (b) if a house be broken into for robbery at night 
(day-time also, New York), or if an attempt be made to burn it; (c) in 
defence of chastity, either by the woman or her relatives (Qu.: her 
neighbour?), but not in case of a woman taken in adultery, for there 
violence is absent; (d) in case of attack 
<!--
THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT. 515 
--><A NAME="p515"></a>
 threatening grave injury, with clearly felonious intent (Blackst., iv. 
pages 178, 181, 184). <p>

(2) Excusable homicide is in case of attack threatening grave injury, 
if no means of escape -- <i>e.g.</i>, retreat -- be present. But if the 
affray be over, or the assailant running away, homicide is criminal 
revenge. Husband and wife, parent and child, may use the same means in 
general for one another (page 186).  <p>

(3) Manslaughter is homicide: (a) voluntary, but through sudden 
passion; (b) involuntary, but while doing any unlawful act. <p>

Attempt at murder is not judged so gravely in common law as in morals 
(except poisoning, in England; Blackst., page 196); it is only on a par 
with manslaughter. Killing another instead of the one intended is 
equally murder in law.  <p>

An act dangerous to others, even when care is used, may result in the 
sin of homicide. It is the same sin for the physician to shorten human 
life for the purpose of avoiding suffering. Abortion is homicide, but 
the mother's life may be saved by what is injurious to her offspring. <p>

(Qu.: Killing it to save the mother's life -- can one life be taken, 
when it will be certainly lost, in order to save another?) <p>

Defensive war is lawful, for the life of the state is more precious 
than that of the individual; therefore all that is essential to war is 
also lawful. Stratagems are lawful, except those which no prudence can 
avoid. If the innocent necessarily suffer in sedition, riot, or war, 
that is not intended, and there is no sin in the result.  <p>

Suicide, as we have seen (Part III., page 299), is sin against nature, 
for though man has direct dominion over his body, it is only "dominium 
utile," received from God and to be accounted for. <p>

Since suicide is also a crime against society, it is murder 
<!--
516 NOTES ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p516"></a>
 by common law, and the adviser of it is guilty of manslaughter 
(Blackst., iv. page 189). The only admissible question in determining 
the guilt of it is, as in any other case, did the person at the time 
know right from wrong? Beware of the sentimental sympathy which 
condones the crime. <p>

(Qu.: The priest is expressly forbidden to use the burial service in 
such a case. What should he do if called upon?) <p>

But exposure of life for a good end is lawful; <i>e.g.</i>, in war, the 
blowing up of a vessel with imminent danger to self. The end sought for 
is not self-destruction. <p>

There is no moral obligation of extraordinary -- <i>e.g.</i>, surgical 
-- means to preserve life. On the other hand, immodcrate asceticism, if 
it injure bodily health, is unlawful, even if the aims are good.  <p>

<i>The Seventh Commandment</i> has been fully discussed in Part III., 
Chapter VIL Only a few words, therefore, need be added. <p>

Questions connected with it require the utmost caution, both personal 
and official, because the soul's desires are soonest reached through 
the imagination. <p>

The Gospel law is given (Gal. v. 19-21), forbidding inordinate (not 
merely excessive) acts of impurity, gluttony, intemperance; in the 
Tenth Commandment are forbidden the corresponding desires, 
imaginations, and other proximate causes of temptation to outward acts 
of sin (S. Matt. v. 28; Eph. iv. 29). <p>

(1) <i>Luxuria</i>, lust, is against nature's primary law, because the 
appetite is given for the continuance of the human race, and the 
creation of the family society (Gen. ii. 18). <p>

Proximate causes, which may become mortal sin, are kisses, even 
touches, exciting novels acting on the imagination, obscene speech 
(sometimes venial), obscene songs. <p>

Voluntary self-pollution, so prevalent among the young, must be 
approached most cautiously, for fear of suggestion. <p>

The prevalent sin of avoiding the ends of matrimony, 
<!--
THE NINTH COMMANDMENT 517
--><A NAME="p517"></a>
 mortal as it is, can only be treated in the most general way, by 
frequent iteration of the ends of this Divine institution (1 Cor. iii. 
17). <p>

(2) Sensuality is inordinate gratification of the five senses, 
especially taste. <p>

(Qu.: Is gratification, purely as such, wrong?) <p>

Temperance in eating, drinking, sleep, recreation, apparel, are alike 
commanded. In general, such moderation is commanded as will favour the 
best condition of our souls. Beyond this, asceticism is matter of 
counsel, or charity, in avoiding scandal of the weak. <p>

Note that sins against the body may produce bodily disease, and demand 
bodily remedies.  <p>

<i>The Eighth Commandment</i> is against unjust acts; the <i>Tenth</i> 
against unjust desires. (See chapters on Right and Justice, on Injury, 
and on Contracts.)  <p>

<i>The Ninth Commandment</i> forbids (a) perjury, as a sin against 
justice and against our neighbour; then (b) lying, for the same end; 
(c) slander; (d) calumny; (e) detraction; (f) rash judgment; (g) 
injurious suspicion. (See Part III., page 311 <i>et seq.</i>)  <p>

<i>Lying</i>. The Gospel law seems to be explicit: "Putting away lying, 
speak ye truth each one with his neighbour; for we are members one of 
another" (Eph. iv. 25). But what is lying? We can only answer, it is 
false speaking or acting with intent to deceive (5. Aug., De Mendacio, 
Contra Mend. e. iii.). It is not a material falsehood, for he may lie 
who speaks the truth when he thinks that it is not true. Lying, 
formally, is the wish, the will to deceive, enunciated in any manner 
whatsoever, whether by word or gesture, by equivocation or mental 
reservation. "He lies who has one thing in mind and enunciates another 
in any way. For the lying and the not lying are to be judged from the 
intention 
<!--
518 NOTES ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. 
--><A NAME="p518"></a>
 of the mind." The enunciation of what is known, believed, or supposed 
to be untrue, is only the "material" part. The essence of truth is not 
in the uttered words, but in the mutual understanding. Therein lies the 
obligation of truth, "for we are members one of another." <p>

The Jesuitical distinction, making lawful "partial mental restriction" 
and equivocation, seems to be corruptive of sound morals. Such 
casuistry says that since the other has no right to know the truth he 
may be allowed to deceive himself respecting your enunciation. The 
answer is that he has a right not to be told a lie even indirectly, for 
"we are members one of another." A true man will say, "You have no 
right to an answer," and bear the consequences. Evasion is no lie; 
amphibology is a lie in intention (Whewell's El. Moral. iii. 393, 
seq.).  <p>

<i>Is a useful lie (mendacium officiosum) a sin?</i> Bishop Taylor 
justifies it (Duct. Dubitant. III. ii. rule 5, qu. 1, &sect;&sect; 9, 
11, 13).<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> But, on the rigid side, consider the arguments presented by 
S. Aug., Cont. Mend., c. v.: (a) Holy Scripture seems to condemn all 
lying (Ps. v. 6; S. Matt. v. 37; Eph. v. 25; Rev. xxii. 15). The deceit 
of S. Peter is rebuked (Gal. ii. 12). (b) Not even to save earthly life 
is life eternal to be risked by sin. (c) Nor to preserve chastity, for 
the purity of the soul is more precious (e. vii.). (d) Nor in the hope 
of benefiting others spiritually; for how can religious trust be put in 
one who will lie for a good cause? (e. viii.). (e) Nor to prevent 
others from doing us an injury (c. ix.). Lighter sins are not to be 
done in order to save others from greater sin; we choose neither of 
them; we condemn both. Each one must answer for his own sin (c. xiii.). 
Sin is not to be measured by temporal consequences. The Divine command 
(Rom. vi. 13) is, "Present not your members unto sin as instruments of 
unrighteousness " and the tongue is such a member. If 
<!--
THE NINTH COMMANDMENT. 519 
--><A NAME="p519"></a>
 we may use it for a falsehood with good intention, why not any other 
member? <p>

S. Thomas Aquinas (see page 381 <i>et seq.</i>) shows that <i>mendacium 
officiosum</i> is always a sin, even if it he a venial one. If so, like 
other venial sins, it aids in forming a character; and it is an easy 
step downwards to <i>mendacium perniciosum</i>; <i>e.g.</i>, in detraction. <p>

(Qu. 1. May another be allowed to deceive himself through your words, 
actions, or silence, when he has no right to the truth -- <i>e.g.</i>, 
in the case of lawyers, physicians, confessors, confidential 
secretaries, ambassadors, commanders in time of war <p>

Qu. 2. Compliments in "good society"? "Not at home" may not be a lie, 
though servants may so understand it. <p>

Qu. 3. May an advocate assert that his client's cause is just?)  <p>

"Lies of necessity" -- <i>e.g.</i>, to save life -- must stand or fall 
with other compulsory acts. It is said that "necessity knows no law." 
But constraint of liberty or threats are not necessity, for there is 
always more or less constraint of fear or forces. It is sin to have 
cowardly fear. Only such fear as destroys the freedom of a
 well-governed man constitutes necessity, or such force as makes 
compulsion. Heroic virtue rises above the common standard of 
compulsion. <p>

Another's necessity, a father's, husband's, etc., stands on the same 
plane with one's own. But antecedent rules are not serviceable for 
such cases, since formal sin is avoided when they are left to the 
emergency which is supposed to be outside of the law.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

On libel and slander, see Chapter on Injury, &sect; 6. 
<!--
520 NOTES ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.  
--><A NAME="p520"></a><p>

Detraction, secret and unjust injury of another's good name (see Part 
III., page 314), is (a) simple detraction when the offence charged is 
true; it is (b) calumny when it is false. It is (a) direct when, if the 
charge be not absolutely false, yet the truth is amplified injuriously, 
or what is entitled to secrecy is manifested, or bad motives are 
imputed to a good or an indifferent act. It is (b) indirect, when good 
acts are denied, or diminished, or silence kept while others applaud, 
or praise is coldly given. <p>

The gravity of the sin is measured by the gravity of the intention and 
of the injury. But it is worse than theft. "Who steals my purse," etc. 
Revealing wrong becomes a duty only when grave injury is effected by 
not doing so, or when another is entitled to know the facts. <p>

<i>Caution</i>. The priest among his people is but too apt to be made 
the hearer of detraction, and needs the greatest care in distinguishing 
what he is entitled to know from idle or malicious tale-bearing. <p> 

It is sin against charity, not against justice, if a notorious offence 
be related to those who are ignorant of it. Listening to detraction is 
sin against justice, if thus inducement to it be offered; otherwise it 
is sin against charity. <p>

(Qu.: Talking of injury done to one's self?) <p>

Restitution is obligatory after these sins, so far as is possible; and 
usually the confessor will defer absolution until it is made. The good 
name is to be repaired or restored, and compensation is due for loss, 
if any there were, even if the fault revealed were actually committed. 
(Without enunciating or implying falsehood one can say, " I ought not 
to have said that respecting him.") Public restitution is due for 
public detraction, private for private. Even inadvertent detraction has 
the same claim. <p>

<i>Excuses</i>. Restitution may be excused (a) if the fault have been 
otherwise revealed, or the good name otherwise restored. <p>

(b) An old charge may have been forgotten; then to apologize for it 
would be to recall it. 
<!--
THE NINTH COMMANDMENT. 521  
--><A NAME="p521"></a><p>

(c) Restitution may be morally impossible, a good name being utterly 
lost. <p>

(d) The detraction may have been unheeded; <i>e.g.</i>, the speaker being 
perceived to be angry. <p>

(Qu.: Suppose that the injured party has been guilty in the same way?) <p>

Satisfaction for insult may recall the offence, and it is therefore not 
usually to be offered.<p>

<a name="n_2"><a href="#n2">{2}</a></a> In fiction the question of <i>mendacium officiosum</i> is very 
forcibly presented in Scott's Heart of Mid-Lothian (c. xviii.). Yet 
Jeanie Deans acted a lie (c. xxix.) in order to save her life. 
Cooperation, also, in the form of silence, not denouncing crime, will 
be found in c. xxxii.; perhaps, in another form, in c. ii. <p>
