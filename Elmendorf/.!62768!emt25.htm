<h3>CHAPTER VI.  CONTRACTS.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Definitions and divisions.</h4><p>

As viewed by Moral Theology, these are constantly recurring 
applications of the laws of justice, especially of commutative justice. 
But common law and moral law sometimes move on different lines. <p>

What is a contract? It is an agreement by which one or more persons 
bind themselves to one or more, collectively or severally, to do, to 
give, or to omit something.  <p>

<i>Divisions</i>. (1) Common law supposes some "consideration," good or 
valuable, which makes the contract (a) onerous. <p>

In morals, however, contract may be (b) gratuitous, which, for our 
purpose, at least, may include such contracts as <i>"mutuum"</i> and 
<i>"depositum"</i> (<i>vid. infra</i>). <p>

An equitable consideration, however, is of no avail if it tend to 
deprive third parties of their just rights; otherwise it will stand, if 
accompanied by deed or immediate possession. <p>

A promise, though morally binding, or a moral duty not enforceable by 
law, will not be recognized as adequate consideration. In law, a 
promise is binding only if it have been accepted, and another promise 
given in exchange, or some act done, which constitutes the 
consideration. <p>

(Qu.: Legal force of subscriptions, apart from expenses incurred in 
consequence of such subscriptions?) <p>

On the other hand, if the consideration be valuable, law will not 
inquire into its adequacy if there be no evidence of 
<!--
544 CONTRACTS. 
--><A NAME="p544"></a>
 fraud. Inadequacy of consideration, or hardship in fulfilling the 
contract, does not per se avoid a contract, unless fraud, or force, or 
want of understanding of it, be proved (Blackst. ii. 445). If a benefit 
accrue to him who makes a promise, or loss to him who accepts it, there 
is sufficient consideration. <p>

(2) Civil law makes four species of contracts: (a) <i>"Do ut des" -- 
e.g.</i>, a sale or loan; (b) <i>"facio ut facias" -- e.g.</i>, marriage, or 
exchange of services; (c) <i>"facio ut des,"</i> as in the case of 
employees; (d) <i>"do ut facias,"</i> as in hiring workmen for wages. <p>

(3) Distinguish, also, express contracts from implied ones; 
<i>e.g.</i>, in employing a person to do work, wherein is implied the 
contract <i>"do ut facias;"</i> or in buying goods without express 
stipulation concerning the price of them, implying the contract <i>"do 
ut des."</i> In morals, other examples may be found in persons 
accepting office with the implied contract of faithful fulfilment of 
its ohligations. <p>

Express contracts are formally manifested in words or other signs of 
consent. Implied agreements are "quasi-contracts," in which consent is 
only implied in suitable action. Thus, a physician, in the exercise of 
his art, is under what we may call a "quasi-contract" to use his utmost 
skill and to do all which his profession implies. Where there are 
social duties to be fulfilled, common law supposes an implied contract 
which can be enforced. "Implied contracts are such as reason and 
justice dictate, and which, therefore, the law presumes that every man 
has contracted to perform; and, upon this presumption, makes him 
answerable to such persons as suffer by his non-performance" (Blackst. 
iii. 159). <p>

(4) Contracts are also either executed or executory <i>in futuro</i>, 
conveying a "<i>chose</i> in action." <p>

Common law, also, divides them, and therefore divides debts, into (a) 
parol contracts, which, even if reduced to writing, require 
consideration, <i>"ex nudo pacto non ori<!--
REQUISITES FOR A VALID CONTRACT. 545 
 --><A NAME="p545"></a>tur actio;"</i> (b) <i>sealed contracts -- i.e.</i>, deeds and 
covenants in which the seal is by common law supposed to be evidence of 
consideration, although some of the United States have altered this. A 
deed, also, is not affected by the statute of limitations as ordinary 
debts are, which are limited to six years, although minors and married 
women are exceptions to this rule. (Qu.: the moral obligation?) <p>

Also, since the object of the limitation is to bar forgotten claims 
where evidence has been lost, etc., any indirect acknowledgment of the 
contract will suspend the limitation. <p>

(c) <i>Contracts of record</i> are judgments, recognizances, etc., and 
since they have the sanction or order of the court, there is no going 
back to defect in the original transaction except by writ of error.  <p>

<a name="sect2"></a>
<h4>&sect; 2. Requisites for a valid contract.</h4><p>

(1) There must be suitable matter -- <i>i.e.</i>, things and actions, 
or whatever falls under full dominion and free administration. <p>

Conditions. (a) The matter must be physically and morally possible; (b) 
it must be existent, or probable in the future (Qu.: contracts in 
"futures"?); (c) it must be the property of the contractor; (d) it 
must be licit, prohibited by no right, otherwise promises and contracts 
are binding neither in morals nor in law; (e) it must be determinate 
in quantity and quality, an individual thing or act, etc. In morals we 
would be bound in this regard to consider the mutual understanding and 
intention. <p>

(2) There must be a lawful cause. In bilateral exchange the cause is 
the obligation assumed by the other party. Causeless contruct, or one 
based on false or illicit cause, is binding neither in morals nor in 
law. <p>

(Qu.: Profits gained by a base contract? See Part II., page 226.) <p>

(3) There must be a capable subject of the contract, He    
<!--
546 CONTRACTS. 
--><A NAME="p546"></a>
 must be in possession of his reason, and not hindered by any law. <p>

The contracts of wives, minors, drunken persons, etc., are ruled by the 
common law. But, by the law of nature, the contracts of those who are 
morally responsible may be binding on conscience when by human law, 
which looks to the universally expedient, they are not so binding. I 
mean that if the contract have been to his injury, one may 
conscientiously use the protection of the law; but he may not benefit 
himself by his contract, and then shelter himself thus (Duct. Dubitant. 
II. i. rule 5, &sect; 4). <p>

In common law the contract of an infant is voidable; <i>i.e.</i>, it is 
void if the court find it injurious; otherwise it may be avoided when 
the minor reaches full age, or he may enforce it on the other party. 
His contract for necessities is binding on his guardian. But when a 
reasonable sum has been allowed for an absent child's expenses, a 
parent is not liable for his extravagant expenditure. <p>

A minor is not legally responsible if he borrow money, but he is 
answerable for his "torts" in that or any other matter. <p>

(4) Common law requires legal proof of contracts; but they are equally 
binding on conscience when there is no legal evidence (Duct. Dubitant. 
II. i. rule 5). <p>

(5) Legitimate consent must be manifested outwardly, but it must also 
be inward and it must be mutual. Even if the contract be gratuitous, 
there must be an acceptance of it. <p>

Consent, also, must be free and deliberate. An imperfect act cannot 
produce perfect obligation. <p>

Suppose that a fictitious contract is made, one of the parties to it 
having no intention of binding himself, or of fulfilling the 
stipulations of the contract. Although, properly speaking, there may be 
no contract, because there has been no true inward consent, yet the 
deceiver is bound in conscience to indemnify the deceived in all 
damages 
<!--
DEFECTS IN CONSENT. 547 
--><A NAME="p547"></a>
 incurred; and, if he cannot otherwise do so, to stand by his nominal 
contract. (<i>Vid. infra</i>, fictitious marriage.) <p>

In law and in morals a contract made by an agent within the limits of 
his authority is completed by his act. But, for legal purposes, 
distinguish herein general from special agents. The principal acquires 
the resulting rights and incurs the resulting obligations. <p>

Silence gives consent in the case of a contract if the matter be 
favourable to the silent party. But saying to some third person that 
you make a contract with one who is absent is not legally making it.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. Defects in consent.</h4><p>

Error, fraud, force, and fear, under certain conditions, avoid a contract.  <p>

(1) Error is (a) with reference to the matter or thing involved in the 
contract; (b) with reference to the nature of the contract itself -- 
<i>e.g.</i>, renting, selling, etc. Every such error annuls the 
contract even if, the error having been discovered, the contract have 
been entered on, unless there has been a renewal of it. For the parties 
must have assented to the same thing in the same sense; otherwise 
there was no contract. This is true both in morals and in law. <p>

(c) Error respecting the qualities of a thing does not usually void the 
contract if there be no evidence of fraud. The general rule is, "caveat 
emptor." But the quality maybe virtually a part of the essence of the 
thing; <i>e.g.</i>, in buying a horse, his having some defect which 
ordinary vigilance cannot discover. In such a case the previous 
principles will apply. <p>

In gratuitous contract, also -- <i>e.g.</i>, subscription for a 
charitable object -- error of this kind voids the contract; for this 
supposes a fully voluntary act in despoiling one's self without any 
return for so doing. <p>

(d) Error respecting the person does not usually avoid an onerous 
contract, except in the case of matrimony. 
<!--
548 CONTRACTS.  
--><A NAME="p548"></a><p>

(e) In morals, not in law, error respecting the motive, if that be the 
final end sought for, invalidates the contract, for it affects the 
substance of it; <i>e.g.</i>, subscribing to what is reported to be in 
need when such is not the fact.  <p>

(2) Fraud is cause of nullity in a nominal contract when without that 
fraud there would have been no contract made. This means that (a) the 
fraud must be material to the contract; that (b) the fraud works actual 
injury whether the statement be literally true (<i>e.g.</i>, stating that 
property in question is worth so much, when it is heavily mortgaged), 
or be known to be false when the statement was made; and (c) that the 
injured party relied upon the fraudulent statement, and had a right to 
rely upon it. Thus was created a special trust. A false and even 
injurious statement believed to be true by the person who makes it is 
not a legal or moral fraud. (See, further, &sect; 5, Sales.)  <p>

(3) Fear is grave or light, produced from an intrinsic or an extrinsic 
cause, necessary or free, just or unjust, produced in order to compel 
the contract or otherwise. All sorts of fear greatly disturbing the 
reason of a well-governed rational man invalidate a contract; if they 
be not so great as to amount to that, they do not avoid a contract. 
Force, also, moral or physical, is in effect the same. If a contract be 
made with one who takes wrongful advantage of necessities, or uses 
actual and extreme violence or threats producing well-grounded 
apprehension of such violence, that contract is voidable in law. <p>

(Qu.: Suppose that the force or fear is for just cause, what is the 
moral obligation of the contract?) <p>

In gratuitous contracts, however, fear or force counts for more than it 
does in onerous contracts. <p>

The obligation of the contract is to all things fairly implied in it, 
and not merely to the letter of it. The obligation is not created or 
the contract made binding by an oath 
<!--
GRATUITOUS CONTRACTS. 549 
--><A NAME="p549"></a>
 if the contract be per se invalid; and the oath is void if it cannot 
be kept without sin.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. Gratuitous contracts.</h4><p>

(1) A promise is a gratuitous contract in which one freely and 
spontaneously obliges himself to give something gratuitously to 
another, or to do or to omit something in his favour. <p>

<i>Conditions</i>. (a) There must be at least the implied will of 
obligating one's self; (b) the promise must be free from all error and 
fraud respecting the thing and the final cause of it, from all 
compulsion and fear, even though thicy be just; (c) the promise must 
be outwardly given and accepted. <p>

Note, therefore, that simple promises usually express merely the 
purpose of the promiser, and, if all these conditions be not present, 
the promise may be revocable. <p>

The promise (Whewell's El. Moral. III. xv. 377) is to be interpreted 
like any other contract, not only by the intention of the promiser, but 
also by the sense in which, without amphibology, he at the time 
believes that it is accepted. This makes the mutual understanding, the 
implied contract. <p>

If the conditions on which the promise is made be unfulfilled, the 
promise is null, for he that accepted it was bound to do so subject to 
those conditions. <p>

Unlawful promises were void <i>ab initio</i>; it is an added sin to 
fulfil them. Here may arise a seeming conflict of duty, for the 
promisee appears to have a claim on the promiser. But we must apply the 
rules for a perplexed conscience, and the promiser's conscience is to 
be the judge herein. Fear and force have been already considered. <p>

Note that a promise without consideration is not binding in common law. <p>

(Qu. 1. Promising the less worthy candidate that you will vote for him? 
<!--
550 CONTRACTS.  
--><A NAME="p550"></a>
Qu. 2. A promise of marriage, carelessly made, and therefore a sin -- 
should it be kept?)  <p>

(2) Donation includes (a) testament. This requires capacity to give 
<i>de facto</i> and <i>de jure</i>, and also ability to receive on the 
part of the recipient. Infants, etc., however, may receive through 
guardians; but to non-existents in general no testament is valid; and 
since in some States a legacy cannot he left to uncertain persons, or 
to a charitable object apart from an existing corporation, the remedy 
is to appoint definite trustees, which should be done in all cases. <p>

The limits of age in the capacity to bequeath, as well as of title to 
receive in other than the natural heirs, etc., are fixed by the laws of 
the State. (<i>E.g.</i>, in New York males must be eighteen years of 
age, and females sixteen, before they can make a valid testament.) <p>

Observe, as a caution for the priest, the objection in common law to 
the attending physician or priest or lawyer's receiving a legacy. Note 
that witnesses ought not to be beneficiaries under a will. <p>

Every natural heir on succeeding to his inheritance ought to make 
allowance for what he has previously received by gratuitous donation. 
Civil law may seem to contravene the law of nature in requiring legal 
formalities for a valid testament, but such formalities must be viewed 
as necessary for the security of society. But if the will of the 
testator were just and clearly expressed, conscience, says Bishop 
Taylor (Duct. Dubitant. II. i. rule 5, &sect; 7), is not released from 
its obligation. This assumes that the rights of property extend beyond 
the owners death. But if, on the other hand, man have not the natural 
right to direct the succession to his property, such succession is 
strictly subject even <i>foro conscientiae</i> to the law of the land 
(Blackst. ii. 13). <p>

But, again, if the heir accept the testament and act under it, does he 
not do so subject to all the testator's conditions, even informal ones? 
<!--
GRATUITOUS CONTRACTS. 551  
--><A NAME="p551"></a><p>

In cases of doubt, the law must decide, and the general rule applies, 
<i>"beati possidentes."</i><p>

(b) <i>Gift</i>. In common as well as in civil law there must be actual 
delivery or else a deed of gift. Anything else would be construed as a 
mere promise, for the only valid donation is <i>in praesenti</i>. 
Without delivery of the gift there is merely a contract <i>in 
futuro</i>, which requires a consideration. <p>

<i>Conditions</i>. (a) The gift must not be prejudicial to creditors; 
(b) the donor must be competent to give, <i>e.g.</i>, of sound mind at 
the time; and (c) not circumvented by false pretences, surprise, or 
inebriety. Any of these defects will void in law and in morals even a 
deed of gift. Gifts are either <i>"causa mortis,"</i> which come nearer 
to testaments, or <i>"inter vivos."</i> The former are revocable in the 
life-time of the donor, if he recover, even after delivery; not so the 
latter.  <p>

(3) "Bailment;" loans and borrowing. Civil law makes various classes of 
bailment, which more or less affect moral and legal responsibility in 
the matter. <p>

(a) <i>"Commodatum"</i> is a gratuitous contract by which a thing is 
granted for the sole use of the "bailee" during a certain time, 
with the obligation of restoring that thing at the expiration of the 
appointed time. If revocable at the pleasure of the "bailor," it is 
called <i>"precarium."</i> <p>

(b) <i>"Mutuum"</i> is also a gratuitous loan, but the thing being 
perishable, a similar thing is to be returned. Money-lending would be 
an example of <i>mutuum</i> if, as in former ages, interest were 
illegal and held to be morally wrong. <p>

These are ordinary forms of borrowing. But in the former the bailee has 
no dominion over the thing; he cannot loan or rent it, and if it be 
stolen or lost he must give full recompense to the owner, unless he can 
prove extraordinary care (Instit. iii. tit. xiii.). If the injury have 
occurred despite alh such precautions, he is not morally bound for 
<!--
552 CONTRACTS. 
--><A NAME="p552"></a> 
 the loss, but the question will be one of civil law as well as of 
morals.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

In <i>mutuum</i>, also, the borrower being solely benefited is bound in 
case of accidental loss. A quasi-contract of this kind is a loan made 
to a minor, which cannot be recovered in law. So, also, if a payment be 
made to him when it is not due. <p>

(c) <i>"Depositum"</i> is a gratuitous contract where the benefit is 
solely on the side of the bailor, as when valuable papers are left in 
care of a banker. Imperfect dominion is given, -- <i>i.e.</i>, of the 
thing, not of its use. The bailee is bound <i>in re -- i.e.</i>, he 
must restore the thing as it was with all its increase, if any there 
be; but he may in good faith deliver it to another who claims and is 
believed to be the rightful owner. He is only answerable for his fraud, 
or for gross negligence in the care of it. If loss occur otherwise he 
is not morally answerable for that loss. <p>

Similarly, if one find property, he is not bound in justice to take 
charge of it; but if he do so, he becomes a depositary, and must use 
the same care as if the thing were his own, and he is answerable for 
gross negligence. <p>

(Qu.: A lawyer has gratuitous charge of his client's funds; by forged 
endorsement they are withdrawn from the bank; which, if either, is 
answerable for the loss? I answer, probably the bank, as having an 
onerous contract, deriving profits, and being bound, therefore, to use 
the greater care.) <p>

(d) A pledge binds in re, and the bailee (e.g., a pawnbroker) is bound 
to use ordinary care, for the benefit is supposed to be on the other 
side. So, he is not answerable if the thing be stolen from him. <p>

(e) <i>"Mandatum"</i> is a gratuitous commission where the  
<!--
ONEROUS CONTRACTS. 553 
--><A NAME="p553"></a>
 mandatory agrees to do something with or about the thing bailed. Being 
for the exclusive benefit of the bailor, the bailee is held only for 
gross negligence. If one undertake to do simply what is requested, no 
property being put in his possession, he is not legally liable unless 
he begin to execute his agency. In that case he is liable for 
malfeasance, but there is no mandatum, no contract in law.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 5. Onerous contracts.</h4><p>

In ordinary onerous contract by mutual consent a right is transferred 
on both sides; dominion is given by delivery of some thing. <p>

(1) <i>"Locatio,"</i> hiring, is (a) of things lent for pay. He who 
hires a thing must take ordinary care; if he do so, he is not 
responsible for loss or injury unless his servants were negligent. The 
owner is bound to keep the thing in good repair, and if the bailee is 
obliged to do so, he must be recompensed by the owner. But tenants of 
houses under lease are subject to special rules. What they have added 
they may remove, if they can do so without injury. <p>

(6) <i>"Locatio operis faciendi,"</i> as when mechanics are employed to 
use materials furnished to them. They warrant ordinary care and the 
requisite skill. If the workman deviate from the terms of his 
instructions or contract, and so render his work of no use, he is 
entitled to no pay, either in law or in morals. The workman retains a 
passive lien (not a right of sale) upon the materials for his pay. <p>

Inn-keepers are another example of the same. They are liable for loss 
through servants, other guests, robbery, etc. (If a trunk be lost in 
the free hack they are liable.) They have a lien for pay on the 
property, not the person, of their guests. <p>

(c) <i>"Locatio mercium vehendarum;" carriers</i>, both private and 
common. (The latter carries for any who will hire him; <i>e.g.</i>, 
cartmen, express agents, etc.) Common carriers are responsible for all 
loss or injury, except the "act of 
<!--
554 CONTRACTS. 
--><A NAME="p554"></a>
 God, or the public enemy." The private carrier is answerable only in 
case of negligence. Without special agreement, the carrier can receive 
only the usual pay. He is bound to deliver what is intrusted to him; 
but the common carrier has a lien on the goods for his pay. The private 
carrier has no such lien.  <p>

<i>"Mutuum,"</i> money-lending, has become a case of (a) in modern 
times. Usury has been debated. Moral justice demands that a full 
equivalent for the loan be returned, and interest will be grounded (1) 
on the lender's loss, if any, in parting with the money; or (2) on gain 
having ceased; or (3) in the fact that there is risk of losing if the 
money be lent. By the law of nature you are not bound to risk the 
losing, except in case of grave necessity. Ordinary fear of loss would 
give no just title to interest; extraordinary does. <p>

(Qu.: Interest when none of these are true?)  <p>

(2) Sale or exchange. (Blackst. ii. 449.) Real property when sold 
requires the formality of a deed, but a contract to sell binds in law 
and in morals with due limitations. Personal property may be 
transferred by parol contract even without immediate delivery. Dominion 
may be transferred at once, even if the contract name a future day for 
delivery. If the seller retain possession, he is bound to use ordinary 
care. In that case gain or loss, if any, accrues to the buyer. <p>

If a finder or thief sell, the owner may take wherever he finds, 
without compensation to the holder. This is moral justice. <p>

The thing sold must be substantially as described. Fraudulent 
misstatement avoids a sale. A buyer also is discharged from a sale made 
under "catching conditions." <p>

If the misstatement were not fraudulent, compensation must be made for 
any loss thereby. This is law and morals. A warranty guarantees all 
statements. The seller, even if 
<!--
ONEROUS CONTRACTS. 555 
--><A NAME="p555"></a>
 not asked, is bound to show all substantial defects relatively to the 
end of the buyer. If asked, he is bound to show secret defects, for 
then the contract is of the nature of a special trust. The seller is 
not bound to call attention to manifest defects, if he have charged a 
suitable price. Special cases are determined by law. <i>"Caveat 
emptor"</i> applies herein.  <p>

(<i>Notes on common law of sale</i>. If the value exceed $50, in order 
to bind the contract part must be paid down ("earnest"), or the goods, 
in part at least, delivered, or a memorandum of the contract signed. 
But the vendee cannot take the goods unless the price is paid, or the 
contract has been for future payment. Delivery may be made to a carrier 
on credit, but the goods may still be stopped <i>in transitu</i> before 
actual delivery. In such a case loss, if any, falls on the vendee. If, 
<i>e.g.</i>, a horse thus delivered die, the vendor is still entitled 
to the price. But some of the United States have abolished these 
restrictions on sale.) <p>

(Qu. 1. May you sell at a high price when you know that there will be 
a speedy fall? Yes; justice does not require yon to impart your 
special information. <p>

Qu. 2. Suppose that the article is harmlessly adulterated, or the 
quantity diminished, and the price is proportional?)  <p>

Monopoly by private persons is immoral, (1) when, by fraud or 
falsehood, in order to keep up the price, other merchandise of the same 
nature with that monopolized is hindered from coming on the market; (2) 
when the market is bought up for the same reason; (3) when false 
intelligence is spread for the same reason; (4) when workmen conspire 
to keep up the price of labour by excluding others.  <p>

Bets, gambling, lotteries are not immoral <i>per se</i>, as contracts, 
but through attendant evils. Relatively large gain 
<!--

--><A NAME="p556"></a>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a></a> A very conspicuous and interesting case of <i>commodatum</i> is that 
of Carlyle's lending to J. S. Mill the first ms. volume of the French 
Revolution, if this were done simply for Mill's gratification. But how 
did the loss of the ms. occur? If it were due to the negligence of
