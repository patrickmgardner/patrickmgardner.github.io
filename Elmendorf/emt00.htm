An unlimited <i>imprimatur</i> has not been requested, and could not be 
expected for this first edition of the ELEMENTS OF MORAL THEOLOGY; but 
episcopal approbation, expressed in general terms as follows, has not 
been lacking. The author can only add that, if in any, even the 
minutest particular, he have deviated from the Divine law as given by 
the Catholic Church, or as applied to us by that National Church to 
which he most directly owes loyalty and submission, he makes in advance 
a humble retractation of any such statement.  <p>

The Bishop of Maine: "I am sure it will be very valuable."  <p>

The Bishop of Albany: "I am very sure that it will be well done and I 
am very glad to help along the publication of such a book." <p>

The Bishop of New Jersey: "I am sure your book will be . . . good all 
through. It will meet a long felt need." <p>

The Bishop of Chicago: "I have heard with pleasure of your intention to 
publish. . . . There is imperative need which I am sure your book will 
do much to supply." <p>

The Bishop of Springfield: "I hasten to express my gratification at 
the prospect of possessing in English your paraphrase of St. Thomas, 
with your own valuable additions. May your effort, so likely to confer 
lasting benefit upon the Anglican communion, be crowned with success." <p>

The Bishop of Florida: "I am glad to hear that we are going to have a 
treatise on moral theology at last." <p>

The Bishop of Delaware: "I am really glad to know of the work which you 
have taken in hand." <p>

The Bishop of Fond du Lac: "It gave me much pleasure to see your MS. on 
Moral Theology . . . It will be welcomed by our theological seminaries 
and by many of our clergy. You will make a most valuable contribution 
to the Church's literature."  <p>

The Bishop of Ohio: "You are truly engaged in a noble work for the 
Church and her teachers." <p>

The Bishop of Milwaukee: "Your work is certainly very timely. I doubt 
not the Immediate good it will do in making our students and clergy 
more familiar with that magnificent treasury of moral theology (the 
Summa.) <p>

The Bishop of Pittsburgh: "I am sincerely glad to know that you have 
been able to translate and prepare it for the press."  <p>

<h3 align="center">PREFACE.</h3><p>

The reader of these Elements of Moral Theology, a student, as I hope, 
of this great science of God's law, will doubtless indulge the writer 
in a few prefatory words. My humble office is that of editor rather 
than that of author. But even as such I would gladly have resigned the 
task to abler hands if any such had appeared. My best hope is that this 
poor attempt will soon be superseded by something better. I have called 
our study a science, for such it is; <i>sc.</i>, the science of he law 
of God, as given to man, in whatever way it is given. This definition 
distinguishes it from Moral Philosophy, which seeks to account for and 
develope, from reason only, the laws and principks of right living. 
Moral Theology on the other hand, is the science of the Divine Will as 
revealed to man. <p>

Well understood, these two must needs coincide, although their methods 
may be different. Moral Theology, making use of the other, is also 
grounded on it, as that in turn is grounded on the nature of man and 
the being of God. <p>

Both the philosophy and the theology, therefore, require a sound 
psychology, and a true theosophy, which in these a Elements are 
assumed. For, like every other special science, Moral Theology has its 
assumptions -- <i>e.g.</i>, that the law of God is revealed in Holy 
Scripture; that the Catholic Church has authority to apply that law, 
and to add positive laws, under the guidance of the Holy Ghost, which 
bind the conscience of every Christian man; and that the gifts of 
gracious help for the due keeping of God's holy law are freely 
bestowed through the ordained channels of grace. 
<!--
xii PREFACE.  
--><p>

Like every other science, also, Moral Theology has its disputed topics. 
There are many propositions contained in these Elements which, if 
properly discussed and defended against all attacks, might fill many 
volumes. It should be, indeed, and it has been, the aim of the writer 
to assert dogmatically nothing which is not accepted by the masters of 
our science; but further than this no scientific manual can go. It 
would he absurd to expect that a primer of astronomy should give a 
demonstration of every assertion. It may be justly required that 
principles laid down shall be consistent with one another, make a 
harmonious system, and be capable of demonstration or verification. No 
more, I think, can be demanded. <p>

But our science is indispensable for the priest who is <i>ex officio</i> 
the teacher of God's law. "The priest's lips should keep knowledge, and 
they should seek the law at his mouth, for he is the messenger of the 
Lord of Hosts" (Mal. ii. 7). Although the Holy Scriptures are the 
supreme source of that law, yet in them truth and righteousness are 
only gradually revealed, and with special application to the special 
cases which elicited the Divine enunciations. Moral Theology stands or 
falls with Dogmatic Theology, both being equally needed for intelligent 
understanding and application of revealed truth and law. <p>

And not only does the pastoral office imply a capacity to speak with 
knowledge as well as with authority, in public teaching or private 
counsel; the injunction, also, to "heal the sick" requires a knowledge 
of inward diseases. Above all, no priest should, except in case of 
extreme necessity, receive confessions, who is not duly instructed in 
Moral Theology and casuistry. <p>

These elements, as their title indicates, are chiefly based on the 
Suruma Theologiae of S. Thomas Aquinas. For the contributions to our 
science in the Anglican Church since the Reformation have been very, 
very few. See the list provided for students of theology by the bishops 
of the 
<!--
PREFACE.  xiii
-->
 American Church; and the chief among those few -- <i>sc.</i>, Bishop 
Taylor and Dr. Sanderson, afterwards bishop -- based their work chiefly 
on the common sources of older Moral Theology. (See Whewell's <i>Hist. 
Moral Phil.</i>, Lect. 12.) <p>

Of the numerous contributions to our science in the modern Latin Church 
I have made moderate use and with great reserve. A very large part of 
their minute casuistical distinctions are based on a very different 
practical discipline of the Christian life from our own. <p>

The first three parts are not a translation of the Summa Theologiae of 
S. Thomas Aquinas; much less are they original work. <p>

They are not a translation; on the contrary, I have avoided, as far as 
was possible for me, the peripatetic modes of expression which mark the 
Angelic Doctor's work. I am perfectly aware that, in doing so, 
precision of thought and expression is, more or less, sacrificed, and I 
am the farthest possible from being satisfied with the result. But, 
remembering that few are trained in scholastic philosophy, while every 
priest, at least, has absolute need of the first principles of Moral 
Theology, have dared to hope for some benefit to the student, even from 
so poor an effort. <p>

Peripatetic expressions are avoided "as far as possible," but 
Aristotelian thought and terminology are too deeply engrafted on the 
language of common life to render such an avoidance completely 
possible. <p>

a considerable part of the Prima Secundae, valuable in itself, did not 
seem essential to these rudiments of Moral Theology. Such portions have 
been greatly abridged, or wholly omitted. <p>

What I have thought needful to add, however, is generally relegated to 
PartlY., the Supplement. But even for that all claim to originality is 
explicitly discarded. What place for originality is there when we are 
to treat of that Holy Law which has been, once for all, Divinely given? 
Moral phil<!--
xiv  PREFACE. 
 -->osophers may ingeniously demolish all preceding theories, and try 
their hand at original reconstruction. But Moral Theology can only 
enunciate, systematize, and apply the Law of God. The first two have 
been so well done by S. Thomas Aquinas that he would be a bold teacher 
who should try to do so over again. But the application of that holy 
law to each changing cycle of the world's history opens new and gravest 
questions. As the world moves, so must Moral Theology move in order to 
direct aright. <p>

I have not ventured to ignore all new problems in casuistry, the 
application of Moral Theology to the practical guidance of life. I 
trust that the road previously marked out has been carefully followed. 
But problems which seemed to call for further discussion have been 
indicated as "Queries," even when I have been tempted to give a brief 
and dogmatic answer. <p>

In the Supplement, citations from the common and civil law are 
introduced because these are among the highest applications of the 
natural virtue of justice, and because duty under such law is part of 
the revealed will of God. Moral Theology, therefore, cannot omit all 
reference to this part of its subject-matter. The writer has not aimed 
at completeness in this respect. He has selected what seemed 
illustrative of his subject, or of special practical value. <p>

And he takes this opportunity to make cordial acknowledgment of the 
valuable aid in careful revision of the text afforded by H. H. Martin, 
Esq., Counsellor-at-law, Chicago, Ill. <p>

The priest will, of course, notice that all such general statements of 
civil law, however correct in form, are practically limited by 
exceptions and qualifications, so that the advice of an expert is the 
only prudent course to be followed. Statements made in the Supplement 
must be so construed. <p>

It only remains that the writer lay this poor attempt at enunciating 
the will of our one Lord at His blessed feet, 
<!--

 publicly entreating pardon for its errors, and asking the prayer of 
every Christian reader to the same end. <p>

offerunt." S. Jerome. <p>
