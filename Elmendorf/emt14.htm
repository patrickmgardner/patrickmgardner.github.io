<h3>CHAPTER III. SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Respect of persons.</h4><p>

<i>Is it a sin?</i><p>

That question is answered by the Divine law (Deut. i. 17), "Ye shall 
not respect persons in judgment." It is opposed to distributive 
justice, whose equality requires that diverse benefits be given to 
diverse persons in proportion to their worth. But, instead of merits or 
fitness something else may be considered; as, in bestowing office, 
wealth or relationship, or party claims, and the worthiness of the 
candidate may be totally left out of view. This is "respect of 
persons." The person may have claims of one kind when he has none of 
another kind. Consanguinity may constitute a claim as an heir, when it 
gives no claim to civil or ecclesiastical office. And what is respect 
of persons in one relation, is not so in another. The question is not 
of worthiness simply -- say, a good moral character -- but of worthiness 
relatively to the honour bestowed. <p>

And since respect of persons violates the proportion which distributive 
justice requires, it is evidently a sin.  <p>

<i>The greater the matter in which justice is violated, the greater the 
sin.</i><p>

And since spiritual things are more precious than temporal things, 
respect of persons is a greater sin when Church offices are bestowed 
than it is in "politics." Yet the distinction just made is to be 
remembered. For he who most abounds in the spiritual gifts of grace is 
simply and in himself the most worthy; but relative worthiness has 
relation to the common good, as in the choice of a bishop. He 
<!--
Qu. LXIV. 1] HOMICIDE. 297 
--><A NAME="p297"></a>
 who is less holy and less of a theologian may be able to contribute 
more to that common good on account of his executive ability or power 
of influencing men, etc., etc. And since spiritual offices are ordained 
for the common good, it may be no respect of persons to prefer him who 
is less advanced in a holy life to one who is more advanced. <p>

But if the reason for preference is not germane to the matter, the law 
of God is broken (S. James ii. 1) -- "Hold not the faith of our Lord 
Jesus Christ, with respect of persons."  <p>

<i>What shall we say of honour and reverence?</i><p>

One may rightly receive these not only on account of some merit of his 
own but for another's sake, even if he be in himself unworthy, as 
magistrates and prelates, who represent God and the community over 
which they preside. So also parents and masters are to be honoured as 
in a certain way participating in the dignity of Him who is Father and 
Lord of all. Old age is venerable as a sign of virtue, although that 
virtue may be absent. Riches may be a mark of higher station in the 
community (or possibly of eminent talents of an honest sort); but if 
the rich man is honoured solely on account of his riches there is the 
sin of respect of persons (S. James ii. 1). <p>

The judge is corrupt who allows respect of persons to influence his 
judgment.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Homicide.</h4><p>

<i>Notice, first (and especially with reference to an old Manichean 
error reviving in certain quarters), that it is lawful to kill the 
brutes for food of man.</i> <p>

In the natural order of things, the less perfect is for the use of the 
more "developed." <sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Plants are for the use of 
<!--
298 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXIV. 2. 
--><A NAME="p298"></a>
 animals; the brutes for man's use. And food is among the chief uses. 
Vegetable life, accordingly, is destroyed for the food of herbivorous 
animals; and beasts, according to Divine ordinance (Gen. ix. 3). for 
the food of man. <p>

Brutes have not rational life, so as to govern their own actions; their 
nature constitutes them instruments for the use of rational creatures, 
including food.  <p>

<i>Is capital punishment rigid?</i><p>

Every part of an organized whole is ordained for the good of that 
whole. If the health of the whole body of a man require the amputation 
of some member of it, because it is mortified and is corrupting the 
other parts of the body, it must be cut off. And each individual in 
society is a part of the whole community. Therefore, if any man through 
his crimes be dangerous to the community, corrupting its most vital 
existence, he is laudably and rightfully killed in order that the 
common good may be saved. "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump" (1 
Cor. v. 6). <p>

(1) The Lord (S. Matt. xiii. 29) commanded that the tares be spared in 
order that the wheat might not be injured by rooting out the weeds. 
Something like this may happen in times of widespread anarchy or 
rebellion, when the extermination of wrong-doers will involve many 
innocent persons in their fate, so that they cannot be put to death 
without grave injury to the common good. But this case is an exception 
to the law that public safety may require the execution of criminals. <p>

(2) Human justice, as far as possible, imitates the Divine and God 
sometimes defers His penalty of death, giving time for repentance, and 
sometimes cuts off the transgressor in the midst of his sin. Human 
justice, in like manner, cuts off those who are most pernicious to 
others, but gives them space for repentance, and spares others whom it 
may hope to reform, who have not injured society so gravely. <p>

(3) It may be true that, considered in itself, it is wrong 
<!--
Qu. LXIV. 3, 5.] HOMICIDE. 299 
--><A NAME="p299"></a>
 to take human life, because we are bound to love all men, even 
sinners. But a man, naturally free and existing for himself in the 
dignity of a man, may reduce himself to bestial slavery (Ps. xlix. 20). 
A man may become worse and more injurious than a wild beast; and he is 
as justly cut off from life. <p>

Such was the Old Law (Ex. xxii.), and such is the Gospel law (Rom. 
xiii. 4).<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup>  <p>

<i>Is it right for a private person to take human life?</i><p>

To kill the malefactor is right as ordained for the preservation of the 
life of the community; therefore, in every organized and civilized 
community, this office belongs exclusively to those who have the care 
of the common good. <p>

But killing a murderer or horse-thief is very useful to the community, 
and may not any man do what is useful for the common benefit? I answer 
that he certainly may, provided that he do harm to no one. But if this 
doing good to the community requires the doing harm to some part of 
that community, it must he through the judgment of one who has the 
charge of that community.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> Lynch law in organized communities is an 
offence against the state and against God.  <p>

<i>Is suicide lawful?</i><p>

It is mortal sin for three reasons. (1) It is unnatural, contrary to 
natural self-love, and to charity, which requires that each one love 
himself as the creature and image of God. (2) Man belongs to the 
community, and in killing  
<!--
300 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXIV. 5. 
--><A NAME="p300"></a>
 himself he inflicts an injury on the community of which he is a part. 
(3) Life is a gift from God, and subject to His power only, whose are 
the issues of life and death. Therefore he that deprives himself of 
life sins against God. <p>

(1) In one way it is a sin against charity, but in relation to the 
community and to God it is a sin against justice. <p>

(2) Even a malefactor is not judge or executioner in his own case. <p>

(3) Perhaps the most plausible argument for suicide in certain cases is 
that since it is lawful to incur a less danger in order to avoid a 
greater one, one's own death may be a less evil than misery or 
disgrace, and be rightly chosen instead of the worse condition. But I 
answer that free-will makes man master of himself, and he can 
lawfully dispose of himself so far as those things are concerned which 
are ruled by his free choice. But the passage from this life to a 
better one is not subject to his free-will but to Divine power. So it 
is not lawful for a man to kill himself in order to go to Paradise. 
Similarly, also, it is not lawful to commit suicide in order to escape 
the miseries of this present life, for its last and greatest evil is 
the death of such a being as man is. Suicide is choosing a greater evil 
in order to escape a less one. (This argument, taken singly, hardly 
seems to reach the case of shortening incurable sufferings.) Likewise 
it is not lawful to kill one's self on account of sin committed, both 
because he cuts short his time for repentance, and because he is not 
judge in his own case of the penalty to be inflicted for his sin. <p>

In like manner, it is wrong for a woman to kill herself in order to 
escape violation. For she ought not herself to commit the greatest 
crime in order to avoid another's crime. It is the mind, not the body, 
which can be polluted. <p>

Again, one may not kill himself to escape temptations, for we may not 
do evil that good may come or evil be avoided. And, further, this 
apprehended evil is an uncertain one, for God is able to preserve in 
the hour of trial. 
<!--
Qu. LXIV. 6, 7.] HOMICIDE.  301 
--><A NAME="p301"></a><p>

<i>Judge and jury must proceed according to evidence, even if they have 
private information that the evidence is false.</i><p>

If they find the innocent guilty of a capital offence, it is not they 
who kill the innocent, but those who bear false witness against him. 
The private information is to he used in another quarter (<i>sc.</i>, 
the executive). <p>

The sheriff and the executioner are simply the ministers of justice, 
and if there be no manifest injustice in the sentence, their private 
knowledge does not affect the question of their duty. It is not they 
who kill the innocent if he suffer by a regular sentence of law.  <p>

<i>Is it lawful to kill another in self-defence?</i><p>

An act may have two effects, one of which is intended, the other being 
aside from the intention. But moral acts get their specific character 
from the intention of the agent. Now, from the act of self-defence two 
effects may follow; viz., the preservation of one's own life and the 
killing of the assailant. An act of this nature, if its aim be the 
preservation of life, is not illicit, because self-preservation is 
nature's first law. But such an act, with good intention, may become 
illicit if it be not proportionate to the end (exceeding that end in 
any manner, or deviating from it). Therefore, it is wrong if any one in 
self-defence use greater violence than is absolutely necessary. One is 
not bound to neglect a moderate defence in order to avoid the killing 
of another, for a man is more bound to preserve his own life than that 
of another man. But it is illicit to intend to kill another without 
public authority. With that authority a man may refer his act to the 
public good and intend to kill, as soldiers do in time of war. <p>

When the apostle (Rom. xii. 19) says, "Avenge not yourselves, but give 
place unto wrath," he prohibits that defence which has the motive of 
revenge, as the shooting a burglar while escaping. 
<!--
302 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXVI. 1, 2.  
--><A NAME="p302"></a><p>

<i>Accidental homicide.</i><p>

What is casual is neither intended nor voluntary. And because every sin 
is voluntary, casual actions as such are not sins. <p>

But it may happen that what is not actually and <i>per se</i> willed or 
intended, is so <i>per accidens</i>, because whatever removes 
hindrances is in that way a cause of the consequences. Hence, he who 
does not remove those things from which homicide results, when he ought 
to remove them, incurs in some manner the guilt of voluntary homicide. 
This may happen either when one is engaged in illicit acts which he 
ought to avoid, or when, being lawfully employed, he does not use due 
diligence. In either case, if from his action the death of a man 
result, he does not escape the guilt of homicide. But it is otherwise 
if he be engaged in lawful business and use due precautions. Accidental 
death is not imputable to him.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup>  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. Theft and robbery.</h4><p>

<i>The natural right of property.</i><p>

The Psalmist says (Ps. viii. 6), "Thou hast put all things in 
subjection under his feet;" <i>i.e.</i>, man's feet. Man's ownership of 
external things is a law of nature. But those things may be viewed, 
first, as regards their own nature; and this is not subject to human 
power but only to the Divine. But also we may consider the <i>use</i> 
of things, and so man has natural dominion over them, because through 
reason and will he can use them for his own benefit as if they were 
created for him. And this natural dominion over other creatures, which 
belongs to him as endowed with reason in which is found the image of 
God in man, is set forth in the very creation of man (Gen. 1. 26). <p>

But this dominion goes further; it is the right of individual personal 
property -- that is to say, first, man has the right to manage and 
dispose of outward things, his personal 
<!--
Qu. LXVI. 3.] THEFT AND ROBBERY. 303
--><A NAME="p303"></a>
possessions. This power is necessary in the proper conduct of human 
life, for three reasons (1) Every one is more solicitous in managing 
what belongs to himself alone than in that which belongs to everybody, 
because, shunning needless labour, he leaves to another that which is 
everybody's business; (2) human affairs go on more orderly when each 
has his own business to manage, while there must be confusion if every 
one indiscriminately attend to everything; (3) in this way greater 
harmony is likely to be preserved when each knows what is his and what 
he has to do with it. <p>

In the second place, this dominion gives the power to use external 
things. In this respect man has no right to treat them as if they were 
exclusively for himself alone; he is bound to use them as the common 
possession of all, being ready to communicate them for others' 
necessity (1 Tim. vi. 18). <p>

(1) Communists say that by the law of nature all things are common, and 
that "property is robbery." But I deny that natural right dictates that 
all things be held in common, and that nothing shall be held by any one 
as his property. But I grant that any existing distinction of 
possessions does not rest on the law of nature, for it is a matter of 
human arrangement; it rests on positive law. Property is not contrary 
to natural right, but things are divided as they are now distributed 
according to what is superadded to the law of nature (<i>sc.</i>, 
according to <i>jus gentium</i>). <p>

(2) The rich man does not act wrongfully in keeping what in the 
beginning was common to all, if he also share with others in the fruits 
of his possessions; but he sins if without distinction he exclude 
others from the use of them.  <p>

<i>What is theft?</i><p>

It is the secret taking of what is another's. The unjust keeping of 
what is another's is an injury of the same kind, and to be included in 
the same general title. 
<!--
304 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. Lxvi. 5, 6.  
--><A NAME="p304"></a><p>

Both theft and robbery imply involuntary loss; but in the one the loser 
is ignorant of the act of taking, in the other he loses through 
violence.  <p>

<i>Is theft always a sin?</i><p>

It is so, first, because of its opposition to justice which renders to 
every man his due, his own. And, secondly, it is a sin because of the 
sinful guile or fraud which the thief employs.  <p>

What shall we say of one who finds what is not his own, and secretly 
takes possession of it? Is he a thief? What is found may never have 
had an owner, as uncut gems and pearls; or it may have been lost so 
long that no claimant of the property can be found. Then it naturally 
belongs to the finder, unless civil law limit his right; but it is 
limited only after judicial sentence. <p>

Again, the finder may sincerely believe that the thing has been 
abandoned by its recent owner; he is no thief if he keep it after due 
inquiry. Otherwise the keeping is undoubtedly theft.  <p>

<i>Is theft mortal sin?</i><p>

The apostle (1 Cor. vi. 10) says that thieves shall not "inherit the 
kingdom of God." Theft is opposed to charity, because it does harm to 
our neighbour, and if it were universal human society would perish. As 
contrary to charity in which is the spiritual life of the soul, it is 
mortal sin. <p>

What is to be said of stealing trifling things? They may, possibly, be 
so trifling that if the owner knew of the act he would not think that 
it did him injury, and he who takes can presume that his doing so is 
not against the owner's will. So far there may be no mortal sin; but if 
be have the iutention of stealing and doing harm to his neighbour, the 
theft of even little things is mortal sin. So is even consent to the 
thought of doing so.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup>
<!--
Qu. LXVI. 7, 8.] THEFT AND ROBBERY. 305   
--><A NAME="p305"></a><p>

<i>Is it right to lake another's property in case of extreme 
necessity?</i><p>

Human law cannot derogate from natural or Divine right. Now, according 
to the natural order instituted by Divine Providence, the things of 
this world are ordained for the supply of man's necessities, and the 
division and appropriation of things, which are based on human law, 
cannot hinder man's necessities from being relieved in this way. 
Therefore what some have in superabundance, by natural right is due to 
the support of the needy. "It is the bread of the hungry which thou 
keepest; the clothing of the naked which thou shuttest up; the 
redemption of the miserable is the money which thou usest in 
'speculation'" (S. Ambros., Serm. 64, De Temp.). <p>

But because the needy are many, and all cannot be assisted by the same 
things, the dispensing of such things is entrusted to the owner of 
property that he may do his share in relieving want.<p>

If, however, there be urgent and extreme necessity (peril of life), 
then one may rightly relieve his need from another's goods without 
waiting for the owner's permission, and this is not robbery or theft. 
Such necessity makes to be his own what he immediately needs to save 
his life. And in case of similar necessity on the part of his neighbour 
which he himself is unable to relieve, he may do the same for his 
brother. (Restitution, however, must be made when that necessity is 
passed.)  <p>

<i>Robbery.</i><p>

This implies violence and compulsion through which another's property 
is taken from him. But in society no private individual has this right, 
but only public authority; therefore whoever, acting as a private 
citizen, takes another's goods by violence is a robber. Executive 
authority is the guardian of justice, and can use violence and coactive 
force only according to the prescriptions of justice in fighting 
<!--
306 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXVII. 2.
--><A NAME="p306"></a>
 against public enemies, or punishing malefactors. What is taken 
through such violence is not robbery, since it is not contrary to 
justice. But unjust taking by those who use public authority and so 
pervert it, is robbery, and the wrongdoer is bound to make restitution 
like any other thief or robber. <p>

In war, fighting for plunder and lawless depredation are common forms 
of robbery which demand restitution.  <p>

<i>Why is robbery a graver sin (and more severely punished) than 
theft?</i><p>

First, because there is more of the involuntary in the former on the 
part of him who is deprived of his own; and, secondly, there is not 
only the loss of goods, but great probability of personal disgrace or 
injury (and natural consequences add to the gravity of a crime).  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. Injustice in legal proceedings.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup></h4><p>

<i>Is it right for a judge to act contrary to what he privately 
knows?</i><p>

He is vested with public authority and acts officially; therefore he 
must judge by what he officially knows, not by his private information. 
He follows public laws, Divine or human, as the case may be, against 
which he can admit no arguments. But in the special case before him he 
has testimony of various kinds, which is the sole ground of judgment. 
His private knowledge will guide him in searching more strictly the 
evidence, and perhaps indicate where additional evidence is to be 
found; but his final decision can rightly rest only on the testimony 
officially laid before him. <p>

God alone judges with proper authority; human judges have only 
delegated power, and are bound to restrict themselves to its limits. 
<!--
LXVIII. 1, 3.] INJUSTICE IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 307  
--><A NAME="p307"></a><p>

<i>Is a man bound to bring crimes of which he has knowledge before the 
cognizance of the proper tribunal?</i><p>

There is this difference between fraternal denunciation, of which we 
have spoken above (page 227), and accusation, that in the former the 
amendment of a brother is the aim, but in the latter the punishment of 
crime. But the penalties of this present life are not sought for on 
their own account, because in this world is not the final retribution; 
but they are medicinal, contributing either to the amendment of the 
criminal, or to the good of the commonwealth, whose good order is 
sought for in the punishment of criminals. Therefore, if the crime were 
such as tended to the public detriment, a man is bound to make 
accusation of the criminal, if he have sufficient proof of the offence. 
And this detriment may be either bodily or spiritual. But if the sin be 
doing no injury to state or Church, as the case may be, or if there be 
not sufficient proof of the crime, there is no obligation of bringing 
accusation, for no one is bound to that which he cannot carry through 
in due manner. <p>

This principle applies to laymen in their relations to the priesthood, 
and to priests in their relation to their bishop, if all be done out of 
charity. <p>

Friendship is no bar to duty in this respect. To reveal secrets and 
cause evil to a friend is against fidelity, but not if they be revealed 
on account of the common good, which is to be preferred to any private 
good. Therefore no secret may be kept (even though secrecy has been 
promised) to the injury of the community. Besides, that is not 
altogether secret which can be proved by sufficient testimony. <p>

But injustice may insinuate itself into accusation in the form of 
malicious calumny imputing crime falsely, or as prevarication, when the 
nominal accuser fraudulently attempts to impede the course of justice; 
or as tergiversation, when he totally desists from what he has begun 
(being frightened or bought off). 
<!--
308 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXIX. 1, 2, 4.  
--><A NAME="p308"></a><p>

<i>May the criminal accused plead not guilty?</i><p>

(Here S. Thomas has in view the criminal process of most European, 
especially southern, countries. The accused is bound in justice to 
answer truthfully all questions lawfully asked, or, at least, not to 
tell a lie. But he may refuse to answer, or appeal to another court. 
But under Anglo-Saxon institutions the plea of "not guilty" is, no 
doubt, understood to be the demand for the production of evidence in 
the case, a demand which every accused person may rightly make.)  <p>

He is not bound to confess his guilt before a human court; he may 
defend himself by concealing facts in all proper ways, using no guile, 
fraud, or lies, because his public condemnation can justly occur only 
under due process of human law and clear evidence. He is not bound to 
give any assistance in this.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup>  <p>

<i>Is it lawful for one who is condemned to death to resist if he 
can?</i><p>

S. Paul says (Rom. xiii. 2), "He that resisteth the power, withstandeth 
the ordinance of God; and they that withstand shall receive to 
themselves judgment;" therefore he seems to sin. But distinction must 
be made between just and unjust condemnation. The latter is akin to the 
violence of robbers, and may be resisted unless grave scandal is to be 
avoided, or serious disturbance is feared. But it is quite otherwise if 
the sentence of condemnation is a just one. <p>

(1) It is true that nature inclines every one to make resistance in 
such a case, but reason and conscience are  
<!--
Qu. Lxx. l.] INJUSTICE IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 309
--><A NAME="p309"></a>
 given to man that he may govern his nature. Not every kind of defence 
is lawful. <p>

(2) No one is bound to do that whence death may follow, but merely to 
submit to the just sentence of the law. He is not bound to remain in 
prison if a way of escape is open; but he may not resist the authority 
which executes the sentence of the law.  <p>

<i>Is a man bound to be a witness in court?</i><p>

His testimony may be demanded by an authority which, in matters of 
justice, he is bound to obey. Doubtless he is then bound to bear 
witness in those things in which according to rightful order he is 
required to give testimony. Such a case is one of manifest wrong -- 
<i>i.e.</i>, a wrong which can be proved -- and one which public infamy 
has preceded. But if his testimony be demanded in other cases -- say, 
secret crime, or one where there is no public infamy -- he is not bound 
to testify. Even if the truth be not brought to light, it may be that 
no one incurs any special loss in consequence. <p>

But, demanded or not demanded, his testimony may be needed to liberate 
a man from unjust penalty, loss, or infamy; then charity requires him 
to testify. And even if his witness be not required, he is bound to do 
what in him lies to bring the truth before some one who can be of 
service to thc accused.  <p>

<i>What shall we say of things confidentially communicated to any 
one?</i><p>

What is heard in confession can in no case be revealed, either in court 
or under any other circumstances. The priest knows it, not as he is a 
man, but as he is the minister of God. This bond is greater than 
any commandment of men. <p>

But with respect to things otherwise confidentially communicated, a 
distinction must be made. For there are things which a man is bound to 
make known as soon as they come to his knowledge, such as corrupt the 
spiritual 
<!--
310 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXXI. 3. 
--><A NAME="p310"></a>
 or corporal well-being of the community, or work grave loss to some 
person. Such things a man is bound to divulge by testimony or 
denunciation; and no secret or confidential communication can excuse 
from this obligation, because it pertains to the fidelity which we owe, 
as part of charity, to the community and to our brother who is injured. <p>

But other things are privately known (as by legal counsellors, 
physicians, etc.) which no command of a superior can warrant our 
revealing; because keeping faith is a law of nature, and nothing can be 
commanded by man which is contrary to natural right.  <p>

<i>Is bearing false witness always mortal sin?</i><p>

False witness has a three-fold depravity; first, from the accompanying 
perjury, which is always mortal sin; next, from the violation of 
justice, which is mortal in its kind, like any other injustice, and so 
says the commandment, "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy 
neighbour;" and, lastly, from the falsehood contained, for every lie is 
a sin. In this last respect the false witness may possibly be a sin 
which is not mortal (the false witness being thoughtlessly given, 
harming no one, and not intended to do so). <p>

Of course one may not assert as of certain knowledge that of which he 
is not certain. But from failure of memory one may think himself 
certain of that which is false, and if he have used due care he does 
not mortally sin in asserting it. He does not intentionally bear false 
witness, but it is accidental and contrary to what he intended. But if 
he afterwards discover the falsity of his testimony, he is bound to 
retract it if he can do so without serious loss; otherwise he is bound 
to make compensation for any loss incurred through his false witness.  <p>

<i>Does a lawyer sin who defends a cause which he knows to be 
unjust?</i><p>

It is illicit to cooperate with another in doing evil, 
<!--
Qu. LXXII. 1.] INJURIOUS WORDS. 311 
--><A NAME="p311"></a>
 whether by counselling him, or aiding him, or consenting in any 
manner. The apostle (Rom. i. 32) specifies it as an added sin, "knowing 
the ordinance of God, that they which do such things are worthy of 
death, they not only do the same, but also consent with those that 
practise them." Now, a lawyer gives aid and counsel to him whose cause 
he undertakes (the argument evidently applies only to civil cases, not 
criminal ones), and he is bound to make restitution of any loss which 
the opposite party unjustly incurs. (But a case may be doubtful, and, 
his client being informed of the uncertainty, the lawyer may go on with 
the case. Criminal cases evidently stand on a different basis; for just 
condemnation can only be that which is legally established. Not the 
actual guilt, but the proof of that guilt, is the question before the 
criminal court.) <p>

The lawyer may possibly show his skill by winning in a bad case, as a 
physician shows his skill by curing a desperate disease. But the two 
are not parallel, for the lawyer unjustly injures the opposing side. <p>

If, in the course of the trial, he discover that he has no case, he is 
not bound to assist the opposite side by betraying what is 
confidentially communicated to him, but he ought to withdraw or try to 
effect a compromise.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 5. Injurious words.</h4><p>

<i>Contumely.</i><p>

One man may dishonour another by. depriving him of some excellence for 
which he is duly honoured, which is done by such deeds as have been 
discussed above (pages 297 ff.). But, also, he may bring forward to his 
notice and that of others what dishonours that other, and this is 
contumely. It properly consists in such injurious words, but the same 
thing also may be effected by equivalent actions. In this way injurious 
loss may be produced; viz., injury to honour or that respect which is 
due from others. Therefore the contumely is greater which is spoken in 
the pres<!--
312 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXXII. 2. 
 --><A NAME="p312"></a>ence of many; but even if it be uttered to the one insulted alone, 
it may be an injustice regarding the respect which is due. <p>

Insults and taunts are offences of the same kind, for all call 
attention to some defect in detriment of honour. But while contumely 
refers to mental defects, insult may apply to bodily defects. If one 
injuriously call another humpbacked, it may be insult; if he call the 
other a thief, it is contumely, also; while taunts may refer to 
station, as poverty or servitude; <i>e.g.</i>, if one injuriously 
remind another that he was aided by public charity.  <p>

<i>Is contumely or insult a mortal sin?</i><p>

The Lord said (S. Matt. v. 22), "Whosoever shall say to his brother, 
Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire," which is the due of mortal 
sin only. Words are more than sounds; they are significative sounds, 
and their meaning proceeds from the mind and heart. Therefore, in sins 
of words we must especially consider the intention. Insult or 
contumely properly consists in the intention to derogate from the due 
honour of another; and this is no less a mortal sin than theft or 
robbery. ("Who steals my purse," etc.) But if one has spoken insulting 
or contumelious words, not with a view to dishonour, but for correction 
or something of that kind, it is not, properly speaking, formal insult 
or contumely, even though the words will bear that construction 
("materially"); and this may he venial sin or no sin at all. But 
discretion and caution are necessary, because the reproach may be so 
severe as injuriously to affect the honour of him against whom it is 
uttered, and then a man may sin mortally even though he did not intend 
to dishonour his brother; just as criminal negligence may cause serious 
bodily injury and make one responsible for the consequences. <p>

(The satisfaction which penitence requires, is special and public signs 
of honour and respect.) <p>

(1) Even reproaches in joke may be vicious, if they tend 
<!--
Qu. LXXII. 3.] INJURIOUS WORDS. 313 
--><A NAME="p313"></a>
 to the same result and "hurt the feelings" of the one so insulted. <p>

(2) The Lord's example, when He said, "O fools, and slow of heart to 
believe" (S. Luke xxiv. 25), shows that reproaches for the sake of 
discipline or correction are admissible under the due limitations 
demanded by our own imperfection. <p>

(3) Since these sins depend upon the mind of the speaker, they may be 
venial, when the reproach is a trifling one and not greatly 
dishonouring a brother, uttered from some levity of mind or angry 
haste, without any fixed purpose of robbing another of due respect and 
honour. (Notice here the violent words of many of the lowest class in 
the community, especially of angry women reviling one another without 
any serious intention.)  <p>

<i>Should one endure contumely uttered against him?</i><p>

The same patience is required in what is spoken against us as in 
what is done against us. But the precepts of patience refer to the 
preparation of soul. One is not always bound actually to follow the 
letter of the Sermon on the Mount; for the Lord who said, "Whosoever 
smiteth thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also," did not 
do this when He rebuked the smiter and said, "Why smitest thou Me?" 
Contumelious words and injurious actions are to be treated in the same 
way. We are bound to have a mind ready to bear reproaches and insults 
if it be expedient so to do. But sometimes it is inexpedient, and the 
insult should be repelled, either for the good of the insulter himself, 
that his impudence may be repressed and that he may not try the same 
course with others, or for the good of others, that our influence over 
them be not hindered by the contumely uttered against us and apparently 
with our consent. <p>

(1) It may be an obligation of charity, not the lust for private 
honour, which moderately represses the insulter. 
<!--
314 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXXIII. 1, 2. 
--><A NAME="p314"></a>
 Hence the two opposite proverbs (Prov. xxvi. 4, 5), "Answer not a fool 
according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him. Answer a fool 
according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceits." <p>

(2) One ought not to tolerate insult offered to another; his repressing 
it is more likely to proceed from charity to his brother; and there is 
certainly no lust of his own honour. <p>

<i>Contumely is one of the fruits of immoderate anger.</i><p>

Detraction. As contumely corresponds to robbery, so detraction to 
theft. For the one is open injury through words, the other is secret 
injury of the same kind. Honour is not directly attacked, but a good 
name is taken away, since those who hear form a bad opinion of him who 
suffers detraction. The end is different then, as well as the means 
employed. But the two may be united, as when one openly but falsely 
accuses another of a crime, or truly, but still publicly, charges that 
which is secret. The special distinction, then, is that while contumely 
is said to a man's face, detraction is uttered when he is absent and 
ignorant of it, whether it be uttered before many or to one alone. It 
is not necessarily diminishing the truth, but it is lowering another's 
good name. This can be done directly or indirectly; directly, in four 
ways, by imputing what is false, by exaggerating what is true, by 
exposing what is concealed, by imputing bad intention to what is 
rightly done; indirectly, by denying another's good action, by 
maliciously keeping silence, by diminishing the merit of his 
action, or approving it in such a way as to have the same effect.  <p>

<i>Is detraction a mortal sin?</i><p>

In Rom. i. 30 backbiters are placed among those who are worthy of 
spiritual death. And the taking away any 
<!--
Qu. LXXIII. 4.] INJURIOUS WORDS. 315 
--><A NAME="p315"></a>
 person's good name is gravest injury, because in this life there is 
nothing more precious, and the loss of it hinders a man from well doing 
his work in life. Therefore detraction is <i>per se</i> a mortal sin. 
But sometimes it happens that words are spoken which are injurious to 
some one's character, when not this but something else is intended. 
This is not "formal" detraction (which consists in the evil intention), 
though it is outwardly ("materially") such. And if the words spoken are 
uttered for some necessary good, the due conditions being observed, it 
is not detraction nor sin at all. These conditions are (1) No more is 
revealed nor to any more persons than is necessary for avoiding the 
evil or attaining the good; (2) the revelation will probably have a 
good result; (3) it is done with good intention; (4) the good sought 
for or the evil to be averted is of serious consequence. <p>

Detraction is naturally the child of envy.<p>

<i>Is it grave sin to listen approvingly to detraction?</i><p>

It is sin to consent to another's sin (Rom. i. 32); and this is done 
either directly or indirectly; directly, when one leads another into 
sin, or takes pleasure in it; indirectly, when one does not oppose it, 
being able to do so not through taking pleasure in the sin, but through 
fear of man. So if any one listen to detraction without opposition, he 
seems to consent to the detractor, and becomes a participator in his 
sin. But if he induce any one to be guilty of detraction, or take 
pleasure in it because he hates the one injured by the detraction, he 
sins no less than the detractor, and sometimes more than he; more, when 
he sins against charity in the sin of scandal towards the detractor, as 
well as against justice towards the one defamed. But if the sin does 
not please him, and he is silent through fear or negligence or 
difference, he sins indeed, but much less than the detractor, and in 
general venially. 
<!--
316 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXXV. 
--><A NAME="p316"></a>
 But sometimes even this may be mortal sin, when official duty requires 
the correction of the detractor, or grave danger results from the 
keeping silence, or when the fear of man is itself a mortal sin. <p>

The detractor may be saying what is true; he cannot be resisted by 
denial of the facts, but either he can be charged with his sin of 
detraction, or, at least, it can be shown to be offensive to the 
listener, by expressive silence, by leaving him, or by changing the 
subject of conversation.  <p>

The "make-bate" (<i>susurro</i>) uses the same means with the 
detractor; but his object is a different one, for he aims by his 
malicious whisperings to break up friendships, and therefore he selects 
such seeming evil things to say as may tend to this end. This 
 tale-bearing is even a graver sin than detraction or calumny, because 
the injury done to our neighbour is the measure of the sin against him, 
and a friend is the most precious of outward things.  <p>

<i>Derision.</i><p>

Mocking at another is intended to put him to shame. The different end 
marks a special sin, different from those just described. This 
"laughing to scorn" is directed at some evil, some defect. But a great 
evil is not treated jestingly, but seriously. Hence, if any such thing 
is made subject of derision, it is treated as a small thing in its 
kind, small in itself, or relatively to the person. But when any one 
turns the evil or the defect of another into ridicule, because it is in 
itself trifling, the sin is venial. But this derision may imply 
contempt of the person; <i>sc.</i>, that his evil is of no more 
consequence than a child's or a fool's. This great contempt and 
dishonour constitute a graver mortal sin than contumely. Gravest of all 
is mocking at what belongs to God in any special way. In the second 
place stands the sin of deriding parents, who are entitled to the 
highest earthly reverence. "The eye that mocketh at 
<!--
Qu. LXXVI.] INJURIOUS WORDS. 317 
--><A NAME="p317"></a>
 his father . . . the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the 
young eagles shall cat it" (Prov. xxx. 17). Next in order comes 
derision of the just, since honour is the reward of virtue, and such 
derision hinders others from imitating the virtuous actions of the one 
derided.  <p>

<i>Cursing.</i><p>

Malediction is speaking evil of another. Consider, therefore, the three 
modes of speaking it; and, first, simple enunciation of evil, which 
has been already considered in its various forms. There remain, then, 
commanding and wishing evil, respecting which observe that what may be 
done, may be wished; and, conversely, what may be lawfully wished, may 
lawfully be done. If any one command or wish another's evil as evil, 
intending that evil, it is the sin of cursing, properly speaking. But 
if any one command or wish the evil of another as a good, it is not a 
sin, it is not cursing. Now this good may be justice, and so a judge 
lawfully utters his malediction on him whom he sentences for crime, the 
Church anathematizes heretics, and the prophets in Holy Scripture 
imprecate evil on sinners, conforming their will to the Divine justice, 
although imprecations of this kind may be understood as declaratory. <p>

Or, again, this good which justifies the wishing of evil may be 
utility, as when one wishes that a sinner may suffer some of the 
consequences of his ill-doing, in order that he may be made better, or 
at least cease from harming others. (1) The apostle (Rom. xii. 14) 
said, "Bless, and curse not;" but cursing proper, <i>i.e.</i>, with 
evil intention, is what he prohibited. (2) It may be said that man 
cannot know the mind of another, nor whether he is cursed by God; 
therefore he ought only to pray for all. But the sinner's heart is 
revealed by some manifest sin, for which penalty is to be 
<!--
318 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXXVII. 1. 
--><A NAME="p318"></a>
 inflicted by the command which speaks evil against him. And in like 
manner, although it cannot be known whom God will curse with final 
reprobation, it can be known whom He is cursing for the guilt of a 
present flagrant crime.  <p>

<i>Is it mortal sin to curse another?</i><p>

To command or wish evil to another, which is cursing him, is in itself 
a violation of charity which requires us to will our neighbour's good, 
and therefore it is mortal sin; and so much the graver as the person 
cursed is entitled to more love and respect. "Every one that curseth 
his father or his mother shall surely be put to death" (Lev. xx. 9). 
But the words uttered may be venial sin, either on account of the 
insignificant evil which is wished, or because the words are uttered in 
jest or thoughtlessness or sudden surprise. For sins of words chiefly 
depend on the inward affection of the soul.<p>

<h4>&sect; 6. Frauds in trade.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup></h4><p>

Is it law to sell a thing for more than it is worth? The great law of 
the Gospel is, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do unto you, even 
so do ye also unto them" (S. Matt. vii. 12). This answers the question; 
for no one wishes a thing to be sold to himself for more than it is 
worth. To employ fraud in order that a thing may be sold for more than 
a just price, is altogether sin because our neighbour is deceived to 
his loss. But if there be no fraud, then we may speak first of buying 
and selling as they are in themselves. They are instituted for the 
common benefit of both parties to the contract; each needing or 
desiring what the other has. But what is undertaken for the common 
benefit ought not to burden one side more than the other; the contract 
should be equal. But the quantity of those things which serve man's 
physical needs 
<!--
Qu. LXXVII. 1.] FRAUDS IN TRADE. 319 
--><A NAME="p319"></a>
 is measured by the price, for which purpose civilized nations have 
used coined money. And therefore if the price exceed the value of the 
thing, or the value exceed the price, just equality is destroyed. 
Therefore, to sell a thing for more than it is worth, or to pay for it 
less than it is worth, is in itself unjust and illicit. <p>

But we may speak of buying and selling as accidentally they turn to the 
benefit of one and the detriment of another. For example, one much 
needs to have a thing and the other is hurt if he go without it. In 
such a case the just price will depend not only on the thing itself but 
on the loss to the seller. And so he can lawfully sell for more than 
the market price, though he may ask no more than the thing is worth to 
himself. But if the thing be greatly needed by the buyer, and he who 
sells incur no special loss by the sale, the latter is not warranted in 
going above the highest market price, because the benefit derived by 
the other does not depend upon the seller, but on the condition of the 
buyer. Of his own accord the buyer may choose to give some bounty in 
such a case, but the seller has no right to trade in another's special 
need. <p>

(1) Civil law may tolerate and recognize such unjust bargains as we 
have been speaking of, because laws are made for a multitude of unjust 
dealers. Therefore human law cannot prohibit everything which is 
contrary to virtue; it suffices that it prohibit what destroys 
intercourse. Other things it may allow, not as approving them, but 
simply as not finding it expedient to punish them. Buying too cheaply 
and selling too dearly may escape punishment or restitution if there be 
no fraud in the contract or the excess be not too outrageous. But 
Divine law leaves no injustice unpunished. Before that tribunal all 
inequality of justice is condemned, and he who has gained too much is 
bound to recompense him who has suffered loss, if the loss be a notable 
one. And I add this because the just price of things is not exactly 
determined, but depends on fluctuat<!--
320 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXXVII. 2. 
 --><A NAME="p320"></a>ing opinion, so that a moderate addition or subtraction may not 
destroy a just equality. <p>

(2) It is a very common desire, that of selling dear and buying cheap. 
But its being general does not show it to be natural, for vice is 
common to many who follow the broad way of sin.  <p>

<i>Defects in the thing sold render the sale illicit and unjust.</i><p>

Defect is (1) in the substantial character of the thing. If the seller 
know it, he is guilty of fraud in the sale, the sale is plainly 
illicit. The contract between the parties is null through defect of 
consent. <sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

(2) Defect is in the quantity as measured, and if any one knowingly use 
deficient weights or measures, he is guilty of fraud, and the sale is 
illicit. Of such injustice the Lord said (Dent. xxv. 16), "All that do 
such things, even all that do unrighteously, are an abomination unto 
the Lord thy God." <p>

(3) Defect, again, is in the quality of what is sold, as in selling an 
unsound animal for one sound in all essential respects. If knowingly 
done it is fraud, and illicit. In all such cases the injustice done 
demands restitution. <p>

But if the seller be ignorant of the defect, his action, indeed, is not 
sinful injustice (since the evil intention is absent, it is a 
"material," not a "formal," injustice); but he is bound, if damages are 
demanded, to recompense the buyer for his loss (unless the sale is at 
the buyer's risk). <p>

What has been said of the seller is equally true of the buyer. The 
seller may be ignorant of the substantial character of what he is 
selling -- <i>e.g.</i>, selling a real diamond under the impression 
that it is only paste. If the buyer know the fact, he acts unjustly in 
his getting possession of the valuable thing and is bound to make 
restitution. The 
<!--
Qu. LXXVII. 3.] FRAUDS IN TRADE. 321 
--><A NAME="p321"></a>
 same principle applies to defect in quality or quantity; <i>e.g.</i>, 
stealing a long ride on the railway, with a ticket for a shorter 
distance.<p>

<i>Is the seller bound to disclose the defects of the thing sold?</i><p>

There are two moral principles which govern the answer to this 
question: first, it is always unjust to afford another man occasion of 
danger or loss; secondly, it is not necessary that a man always give 
aid or counsel for the benefit of whatsoever person he has dealings 
with. (This may be an act of charity, but we are now considering what 
justice demands.) This is an obligation in some determined cases; 
<i>e.g.</i>, when you are responsible for the other's action, he being 
under your charge, or when the other needs assistance and he can get it 
from no other. But the seller, in offering a defective thing for sale, 
if its defect be of such a nature as to cause loss or danger, violates 
the first law of natural justice just indicated. He gives occasion for 
loss if he subtract nothing from the price of the inferior article but 
demand full value for it. He gives occasion for danger if the defect 
hinder or render unsafe the use of the thing, as in selling a
 saddle-horse that shies, or adulterated medicines or food. If such 
defects are not manifest to the buyer, and the seller does not disclose 
them, the sale is illicit and fraudulent, and the seller is bound to 
make compensation for the loss. <p>

But if the defect can be readily discovered by a buyer using ordinary 
precaution, as when the horse sold is blind in one eye, or when the 
defect makes the article useless to the seller, but others may have use 
for it, and if the seller duly  reduce the price demanded, he is not 
bound to call attention to the defect, because the buyer might then 
demand too great a reduction in the price. So the seller may guard 
himself against loss by keeping silence respecting defects. <p>

(1) Suppose that you say that the buyer is not under compulsion; the 
thing is submitted to his judgment, and   
<!--
322 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXXVII. 4. 
--><A NAME="p322"></a>
 the other is not bound to supply him with judgment for his bargain. 
But there can be no judgment where a thing is not manifest. One judges 
according to what he knows. So there is an essential difference between 
manifest defects and those which cannot be detected by ordinary 
observation. If the seller does not call attention to the latter, the 
thing is not sufficiently presented to the buyer's judgment. <p>

(2) But why should any one stand in his own light, impede his own 
business? It is not necessary to make public proclamation of faults 
and keep off buyers; but natural justice requires that in pointing out 
the good qualities of what he offers for sale, he also indicate hidden 
defects which may cause loss or danger to another. Even so, he is not 
bound to thrust moral advice on every one whom he encounters; but if 
his own acts threaten moral danger to others unless he tell the truth 
concerning them, he is bound to give proper explanation of them. <p>

(3) But a man may have private information that the article for which 
he is demanding a high price will shortly be cheaper because a large 
supply is coming on the market and yet he is perfectly just in 
demanding that high price, without giving others information which 
would lower the price. What, then, is the difference between that case, 
and the one which we are now considering? I answer that it is precisely 
the difference between the present and the future. The existing defect 
makes the present value of the thing less than its apparent value. In 
the other case, the value is going to be lower; but in just contracts 
<i>de praesenti</i>, the question is of the market value for the day, 
not of some coming day, unless the bargain be explicitly in "futures." 
This being true, the buyer also may have private knowledge that prices 
are shortly to go up; he is not bound to publish that information.  <p>

<i>Finally, what makes it just to buy cheap and sell dear?</i><p>

The mere lust for gain is criminally base, knowing no 
<!--
Qu. LXXIX. 3.] OMISION. 323 
--><A NAME="p323"></a>
 honorable or necessary terminus, but stretching out <i>ad 
infinitum</i> to a vicious end. But gain, which is the object of buying 
and selling, has in itself no such vicious end, for it may be merely 
the means for necessary or virtuous ends, as the support of a family or 
the doing good to the community. Moderate gains of trade so sought for, 
not as an end but as the rewards of labour, are certainly lawful and 
honourable. (The author seems to overlook the service which is done to 
the community by bringing the producer and the consumer into relations 
of mutual service. This benefit is conferred by "middlemen," by 
wholesale and retail trade, which is certainly entitled in justice to 
its fair profits. <p>

The author's discussion of usury is omitted. His argument concerns the 
lawfulness of profit for the use of money, and he regards the 
prohibition of such "usury" among the Israelites as a universal law 
against what is simply unnatural and evil. The lawfulness of demanding 
compensation for loss on the part of the lender is only glanced at; 
compensation for the risk of losing the loan is left out of view.)  <p>

<h4>&sect; 7. Omission.</h4><p>

<i>Sins of omission.</i><p>

As transgression, implying contempt of negative commands, is a special 
sin, so is omission, as implying contempt of affirmative commands. It 
implies neglect not of every good, but of that good which is due. But 
the good viewed as a debt, pertains to justice. Hence, in the way in 
which justice is a special virtue, omission is a special sin, distinct 
from the sins which are opposed to the other virtues; it is the neglect 
of that good which justice commands. <p>

Omission is sometimes involuntary, as when one has lost what he is 
bound to restore, or when a priest is hindered from fulfilling his 
duties. But omission proper is only of that due good to which one is 
bound. Now, no one is bound to the impossible, nor is there sin of 
omission in not doing what one is unable to do. (The sin of omission 
<!--
324 SINS OPPOSED TO JUSTICE. [Qu. LXXIX. 3. 
--><A NAME="p324"></a>
 consists in not willing, not saying, not doing what one is hound to 
will, to say, to do, having the requisite power thereto.)  <p>

<i>When does this sin of omission begin?</i><p>

Is one sinning all the time in which he is not doing what is 
obligatory? The sin of omission is opposed to affirmative precepts, 
which command the good. But such precepts do not bind at all times so 
far as action is concerned, but at a determined time, place, etc. And 
at that time the sin begins. At that time, it is true, he may be unable 
to act, and if that inability he not his fault he does not neglect what 
is due. But if that inability proceed from previous fault -- say, 
negligence in taking care of what he is bound to restore -- that 
negligence is the cause of the sin of omission but this latter sin 
begins, not with the negligence, but with the determined time for 
restoring, or whatever the neglected duty may be. But the omission is 
voluntary, since its cause is so; therefore it is a sin. <p>
