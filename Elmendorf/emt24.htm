<h3>CHAPTER V.  INJURY.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Definitions and divisions.</h4><p>

Injury (<i>"injuria"</i>) is the violation of another's right. it is at 
once sin against the individual man, against society, and against God, 
whose law of justice and charity is broken.  <p>

<i>Divisions</i>. It is "formal injury" when it is intended; it is only 
"material" injury, when it is not intended. It is grave or light 
relatively to the injured person. It is direct, or it is indirect when 
it is foreseen and permitted in its cause. <p>

Note that the question of involuntary injury -- <i>e.g.</i>, that done 
by one intoxicated -- has been considered under the question of 
ignorance, <i>q. v.</i>, page 466. <p>

But common law accepts no such defence, considering the ease with which 
such plea is made, and punishing the voluntary loss of reason (Blackst. 
iv. page 25). <p>

<i>Damnum</i>, loss, may be caused without injury, for <i>"scienti et 
volenti non fit injuria,"</i> except when a man cannot lawfully yield his 
right. <p>

(Qu. 1. Parental right <i>versus</i> legislation concerning children's 
education? <p>

Qu. 2. Abridging the suffering in case of mortal injury when so 
requested?) <p>

Injury also may be caused without loss, as in the case of rash and 
unjust judgment. <p>

Injury may be otherwise divided according to its object, as done to 
goods of fortune, of body, of soul, of good name. <p>

For the ends of civil society the most fundamental divi<!--
TITEFT. 531  
 --><A NAME="p531"></a>sion is, (1) private wrongs, infringement of the private or civil 
rights of individuals considered as such; and (2) public wrongs, 
"nefas," where the community as well as the individual is considered to 
have been injured. The latter are crimes and misdemeanours. In civil 
law a crime or a misdemeanonr (a lighter act of similar nature) is an 
act committed or omitted in violation of a public law. To constitute a 
crime in the view of civil law there must be an overt act, as well as a 
vicious will. Felony in the United States is a crime punishable with 
death or confinement in a State prison.  <p>

<i>Minors</i>. By common law an infant under seven years cannot be 
guilty of felony; between seven and fourteen years, inquiry must be 
made whether he is <i>"deli capax."</i> If he be over fourteen years, 
without question the felonious act is felony in him.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Theft.</h4><p>

Theft (see Part III., page 302) is unjust taking of another's property, 
the owner being unwilling. The "formal" part is the intent to defraud.  <p>

Divisions. It is (1) simple theft, the secret taking; (2) robbery, 
taking with violence; (3) fraud, deceiving in contracts; (4) sacrilege; 
(5) peculation, the very common stealing from the public purse. All 
are mortal violations of the law of nature. <p>

The evil intention is the formal part of the sin in theft; but the 
crime of stealing is not altogether so viewed in common law. <p>

Thus the attempt to commit a felony is only a misdemeanour. So also is 
coiiperation in the form of solicitation or incitement to commit the 
theft. "The attempt and not the deed confounds us," is not true of 
common law. In theft also, as viewed by common law, there must be 
actual 
<!--
532 INJURY. 
--><A NAME="p532"></a>
 possession taken, and not the mere preparation for it (Blackst. iv. 
222, 231). To constitute stealing, however, there must be felonious 
intent; otherwise the act may be only trespass (page 232), <p>

But if other injury be done, even though unforeseen, while one is 
guilty of an unlawful act, he is held to be answerable for that injury. 
Homicide committed by one engaged in a felonious act may be viewed as 
murder.  <p>

<i>Blackmail</i>. Sending letters which threaten to accuse of crime, 
etc., with a view to extort money, is an attempt to rob, and crime by 
modern law.  <p>

The theft may be of a thing so trifling as to cause no appreciable 
injury (see Part III., page 304); but it is not to be overlooked that 
by accumulation the thief may be enriched; <i>e.g.</i>, retail dealers 
by short measure and light weight. <p>

(Qu.: Suppose that the price set upon the goods is proportioned to the 
light weight or short measure  <p>

In the case, again, of children and servants, it is certainly true that 
if the article be trifling in value, or be consumed, not preserved, 
given away, or sold, the owner may be presumed to be less unwilling to 
part with it than in other cases of theft. But this applies only to the 
"material" part of the act. We are bound to consider the formal intent, 
and the tendency of what may possibly be venial sin in itself. <p>

It may be suggested, indeed, that the taking of the little thing 
without the owner's knowledge or assumed consent may neither harm him, 
nor intend to do so, nor sensibly enrich the taker. In this case there 
is, undoubtedly, the sin of theft, but surely not so grave as other 
sins which violate justice and charity.  <p>

Since the fruits of productive property, including private 
<!--
RESTITUTION. 533
--><A NAME="p533"></a>
 or public funds, belong to the owner of the same until he transfers its 
use, it is evident that if the guardian or trustee or treasurer of that 
property appropriate to himself those fruits of it -- say, using for 
himself the interest on those funds, or seeking profits on them in 
"speculation " -- he is indirectly a thief, even if he restore the 
property undiminished. For he is not a <i>"usufructuarius."</i><sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></small></sup>  <p>

<i>Extreme necessity</i> -- <i>i.e.</i>, immediate danger of life or limb, 
etc. -- "knows no law." I mean that there is a natural right to use, 
sufficiently for the pressing necessity, whateyer can be found, and 
that taking it is no theft. For the owner's <i>dominium utile</i> is 
subject to God's higher dominion and law, and the human steward is 
bound not to be unwilling in such a case of need. <p>

(Qu.: Suppose that the extreme need is in another, and that you 
yourself have no means of supplying it from your own resources <p>

But restitution afterwards is due, if that become possible. What was 
secretly taken may he secretly restored.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. Restitution.</h4> 
(See Part III., page 286.) <p>

Violation of right, being an offence against God, must in  
<!--
534 INJURY. 
--><A NAME="p534"></a>
 all cases be made good as a. condition of pardon from Him. 
Compensation, indemnification, etc., are required by commutative 
justice in the law of nature, and in the revealed law (S. Jas. v. 4), 
as well as in human law. <p>

But violations of distributive justice or of charity as such do not 
demand restitution, because, strictly speaking, they cannot be made 
good in the same manner with violations of commutative justice. The 
fault can be amended, but the past loss cannot be repaired. This is the 
principle which applies to penitence in respect of retributive justice. 
A propitiatory sacrifice must supply what penitence cannot. <p>

Note, however, that the same offence may violate both forms of justice. 
Thus a negligent ruler may cause grave loss to the ruled, and violate 
the implied contract with them, and become subject to the law of 
restitution proper. <p>

Restitution is based upon the law of nature that "since all wrongs may 
be considered as merely a privation of right, the plain natural remedy 
for every species of wrong is the being put in possession of that right 
whereof the person injured is deprived" (Blackst. iii. 116). As a 
negative law -- <i>sc.</i>, "Thou shalt not withhold his right from thy 
brother" -- restitution is always obligatory; but as a positive law -- 
<i>sc.</i>, "Restore at once his right" -- it is binding under the due 
conditions. The obligation arises from (1) unjust possession of 
another's property; (2) from unjustly causing loss; (3) from unjust 
cooperation in injury done by another.  <p>

<i>Maxims</i>. (1) <i>"Res clamat domino."</i> The right of the owner 
follows the thing wherever it may go. By common law he may recover his 
property even from a <i>bona-fide</i> purchaser wherever it may be 
found (Blackst. iii. 4; 363). In such a case, however, the original 
<i>bona-fide</i> purchaser is not bound in conscience to make 
restitution if the thing have passed into other hands and cannot be 
recovered. 
<!--
RESTITUTION. 535  
--><A NAME="p535"></a><p>

(Qu.: Suppose that in good faith he has sold the thing, to whom does 
the price of it belong?) <p>

(Note that property thus found must not be taken with violence. The 
owner must not be guilty of a "breach of the peace." He may not enter a 
third person's house for the purpose of getting his own, if that third 
person have not been accessory to the wrong. He may take possession of 
his own house or land, and eject an intruder, as also he may abate a 
public or private nuisance as an injury to the public -- <i>e.g.</i>, 
nuisance made by an act of commission -- only it must be done without 
riot. He may distrain goods for rent not paid, and cattle trespassing 
on his premises (Blackst. iii. 5, 218;, iv. 167). <i>"Sic utere tuo ut 
alienum non laedas,"</i> says common law as well as the Divine law.) <p>

Prescription, as already noted, gives claim to property in pure water, 
etc. But damage, if any, must be direct, not consequential. <p>

(2) <i>"Resfructificat domino;" i.e.</i>, the natural fruits or profits 
of a thing, and the use or enjoyment of it, belong to the owner 
thereof. This is included in the idea of dominion. <p>

(3) <i>"Res naturaliter perit domino;" i.e.</i>, when the object ceases 
to exist, dominion of it ends; but there may be still existing an 
equivalent which belongs to the owner of the previous property. <p>

(4) <i>"Nemo ex re alterius locupletari delet;" i.e.</i>, no one may 
rightfully be enriched through another's property; hence it follows 
that the measure of restitution due in such a ease is the quantity of 
the thing detained from its owner, together with the accrued profits. <p>

(Qu.: If a public treasurer or a trustee of funds make a profit by 
"speculating" with those funds, to whom does the profit belong?)  <p>

How and to whom restitution is to he made. (See Part III., page 285.) 
In the common frauds in trade the owner 
<!--
536 INJURY. 
--><A NAME="p536"></a>
 may be unknown or cannot be reached; then that which is gotten by 
fraud, not belonging to the possessor, can only be restored by giving 
to charitable uses for which society at large is responsible. <p>

In many cases it is impossible to make full restitution for the injury 
done against commutative justice; then the restoring such part as is 
possible is obligatory on conscience as a condition of pardon for the 
sin. <p>

Extreme necessity justifies delaying or withholding restitution. <p>

The restitution may be made secretly, or through another; all that is 
required is that the wrong be made right. <p>

Note the grave sin -- very common -- of keeping up the expenses of 
life, and thus defrauding creditors.  <p>

The possessor <i>bona fide</i>, as soon as he knows that the thing 
possessed is not his own, is bound to restore it to the rightful owner, 
if he be known; and this, in whole or in part, as the thing may be at 
the time, together with the profits which have been derived from it, if 
any there have been. <p>

If he have bought stolen property, he has run his risk in doing so, and 
he must lose, since the rightful owner cannot justly be made the loser 
(Blackst. iv. 363). <p>

But the possessor <i>bona fide</i> is bound to no compensation if he 
have consumed, destroyed, given away, or lost the thing, or if it have 
been stolen from him. For it is not the materially causing loss 
(<i>damnificatio</i>) which demands restitution, but the formal injury. <p>

But the case is different if he have become richer by the possession of 
another's property; then he is bound to return the natural and the 
civil fruits of the thing, but not such fruits of it as he has gained 
by his own industry in using it. <p>

Suppose that this wrongful possessor has sold the thing; then, if the 
owner reclaim it, the seller is bound to return 
<!--
DAMNIFICATIO. 537 
--><A NAME="p537"></a>
 the price to the buyer, for in the contract of sale a good title to 
the thing was implied. <p>

(Qu.: Suppose that he has sold at a profit, to whom does that profit 
belong?)  <p>

The possessor <i>mala fide -- i.e.</i>, knowing that the thing is not 
his own -- is bound to compensate the owner for every kind of loss, 
including profits, which might have been derived if the thing bad 
remained in the owner's possession. There are various difficult cases 
of conscience in this regard, but the maxims given above will generally 
solve them. <p>

If the thing unjustly possessed pass through various hands in bad 
faith, each person so receiving it is responsible for the whole.  <p>

The possessor in doubtful faith. is bound to make careful inquiry. If 
this be done, and the title still remain in uncertainty, he may retain 
the thing with a good conscience; for <i>"melior est conditio 
possidentis;"</i> the presumption is in his favour, and other claimants 
to the thing must show a better title than his.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. Damnificatio.</h4><p>

Though unjust damage requires indemnification, yet the moral fault, 
which offends God, must be distinguished from juridical fault as 
resting on a sentence from a civil court. For the law will punish 
omission of due care if it cause loss, whether there has been any moral 
fault or not. <p>

The unjust damager is bound to full restitution of the thing or its 
equivalent, and also of its profits; <i>e.g.</i>, if a house be 
burned, or if workmen lose time through your neglect, those who suffer 
loss must be indemnified for rent in the one case, for loss of wages in 
the other. <p>

<i>Conditions</i>. (a) There must have been an unjust act of omission; 
(b) it must be the cause of the loss and morally culpable -- 
<i>i.e.</i>, through foresight, intention, or criminal 
<!--
538 INJURY.
--><A NAME="p538"></a>
negligence. These conditions are requisite to constitute the moral 
fault; but even otherwise the sentence of the court in finding 
juridical fault binds conscience -- <i>e.g.</i>, if one have used all 
ordinary or due care. <i>E.g.</i>, suppose that animals belonging to 
you cause the loss; if it be through your negligence, you are morally 
bound; if not so, you are not bound to make compensation until the 
sentence of the court so decrees. <p>

Suppose, again, that without moral fault on your part loss occur 
through your fulfilment of your official obligations, as in the case of 
a physician; there is no obligation of restitution. <p>

Suppose, again, that you at first caused the loss without fault, but 
afterwards did not do your best to stop that loss; you owe restitution. <p>

(Qu.: Suppose that loss is caused to society by your aiding in giving 
office to the unworthy?)  <p>

<h4>&sect; 5. The unjust accessory.</h4> (See Part III., page 292.)  <p>

Cooperation may now be further considered in its application to injury 
done. <p>

(1) <i>Command</i> causing moral compulsion requires restitution for injury 
done if the loss directly result from the command, and this also if the 
one commanded suffer loss in consequence of his obedience to the 
command. <p>

(Qu.: Responsibility of the one commanded -- <i>e.g.</i>, a clerk 
executing fraudulent orders; a railway clerk obeying the orders of his 
superiors?) <p>

(2) <i>Advice</i> may be a cause of loss; and restitution is due if 
that advice were efficacious; but it is not due if the act would have 
been done in the same way without the advice. <p>

The advice may have aided in causing the result, without its being 
properly efficacious. <p>

Again, it may be inquired whether that advice were given with the 
weight of authority. If not, there may be no obli<!--
THE UNJUST ACCESSORY. 539
--><A NAME="p539"></a>gation of restitution, as in the familiar case of those who are not 
experts volunteering their advice in difficult matters. Compare the 
injurious advice of the priest, the lawyer, the physician, with the 
friendly words of neighbours; the former may be the efficacious cause 
of loss when the latter count for very little. The one who follows bad 
counsel, knowing it to be bad, may suffer in consequence thereof; but 
he has no claim for indemnification from his adviser. <i>"Scienti et 
volenti non fit injuria."</i> <p>

(3) <i>Consent</i> binds to restitution for loss, if it be efficacious. 
Consider the political obligations of voters, and their contributing to 
public loss by knowingly voting for the less worthy, or by withholding 
their votes from the worthy. <p>

(4) <i>Praise or blame</i> before the act is done is equivalent to 
counsel, and is to be judged by the same rules. Restitution is not due 
when the act already done is applauded. <p>

(5) <i>Participation</i> may be either in the injurious act or in its 
profits. In both eases restitution for injury done is obligatory, 
subject to the conditions respecting co6peration which have been 
already pointed out. <p>

(6) <i>By silence</i>, by not hindering, by not revealing, 
<i>negative</i> cooperation in injury is given. For the injury is not 
hindered when it is possible so to do (<i>e.g.</i>, not voting for the 
more worthy candidate for office). In such cases the law of charity is 
violated, which sin calls for repentance and amendment, not for 
restitution, unless the duties of one's office have been neglected. <p>

Observe that the superior is answerable, in common law as well as in 
morals, for the negligence of his employees, if his own negligence were 
culpable. This is true of both servants and agents. But in common law 
exception is made if the negligence of those employees were wilful, 
criminal injury, or out of the line of their authority. But, on the 
other hand, owners of hacks, or inn-keepers, are liable for injuries 
done through drivers or servants, and can claim no such exception 
(Blackst. i. 430). 
<!--
540 INJURY.  
--><A NAME="p540"></a><p>

<h4>&sect; 6. What things are to be restored?</h4><p>

(1) <i>Goods of the soul</i>. The injury which is done through deceit, 
fraud, or unjust fear must be repaired; otherwise, only charity binds 
the conscience, for <i>"scienti et volenti non fit injuria."</i> Such 
unjust injury may be error in faith or in morals, and it is the 
erroneous official teacher, not the unofficial, who is bound to correct 
the error, if it were due to ignorance or negligence, not to guile or 
deceit. <p>

Common law is very careful in defining what slander and libel are 
actionable (Blackst. iii. 123), setting very definite limits in this 
regard; <i>e.g.</i>, limiting the time within which action may be 
brought. <p>

But note the attempt of American newspapers to relax the common law of 
libel. <p>

But though it is strictly just so far as it goes, conscience must go 
much further to the intended wrong and the injury actually done. For 
the truth of the charge will not release conscience from its 
obligation, whatever American newspapers may claim, if there were no 
just warrant for the publication. But the legal distinction between 
malice in fact -- <i>i.e.</i>, actual malice -- and malice in law -- 
<i>i.e.</i>, a wrongful act intentionally done -- is equally 
serviceable in our science of Moral Theology. <p>

(2) <i>Goods of body -- e.g.</i>, loss of life or limb, or violation of 
chastity -- call for retributive justice, and no proper restitution can 
be made. (Vid. infra, Satisfaction.) But all eLmsequent losses which 
can be measured demand strict restitution. <p>

(Qu.: Is the seducer who has not made promise of marriage bound to 
marry the seduced? If illegitimate progeny be in question, both human 
and Divine law make him responsible for the support and education of 
that offspring, and, in many eases at least, this may require 
marriage.) <p>

(3) Goods of fortune have been already considered as a question between 
man and man; but they are also due to the state, according to Divine 
command as well as the law 
<!--
WHAT THINGS ARE TO BE RESTORED? 541 
--><A NAME="p541"></a>
 of nature, since they are necessary for the common good. Lawful 
government, therefore, has a right to part of the people's goods, and 
that part may be collected either directly or indirectly, as excise or 
tariff. <p>

<i>Conditions</i>. (a) Taxes must be just, <i>i.e.</i>, imposed for the 
common good; (b) they must he laid equally on all; if so, they are 
binding on conscience (S. Matt. xxii. 21; Rom. xiii. 6). <p>

Note, therefore, the sin of evading such burdens, thereby increasing 
those of other citizens; of corrupting assessors, custom-house 
officers, tax collectors, etc. But there are many difficult questions 
involved in the determining what is right.  <p>

Injuries in trade. "Forestalling" the market -- <i>i.e.</i>, 
contracting for merchandise on its way to market, etc., with a view to 
the undue enhancing of the price of it; "engrossing" provisions by 
buying them up for the same purpose ("corners"); spreading false 
rumours for the same end; getting a monopoly of necessaries, or making 
a combination for the same purpose, are offences punishable by common 
law<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup> as well as by the Divine law (Blackst. iv. 158). Should they not 
be, at least, as severely treated by human legislation as "conspiracy" 
among labourers? The same principles apply to interference with 
workmen, preventing them from hiring themselves, compelling them to 
join unions ("scabs"), or other interference with the freedom of 
labour. <p>

(Qu.: Do harmless adulterations violate the law of justice if the price 
of the article be reduced accordingly?)  <p>

Satisfaction to retributive justice. (See Part III., page 308.) The 
question is not now of what is due to Divine retribution, but of 
penalties inflicted by human law, such as capital punishment, 
confinement in prison, exemplary dam<!--
542 INJURY. 
 --><A NAME="p542"></a>ages, and the like. These rest upon the just sentence of human law, 
and not on the satisfaction which the penitent voluntarily offers to 
the broken law of God. <p>

One is bound, therefore, when condemned, to bear the penalty of the law 
if he be guilty and if the law be just; but no moral law requires him 
to come forward and denounce himself. <p>

It follows, also, that escape by breaking jail is justly treated as 
felony by common law, as also "rescue," or aiding another to escape. <p>

(Qu. 1. Suppose that the condemned to death or long Imprisonment has 
opportunity to escape without injuring others; is he guilty before God 
in doing so?) <p>

Qu. 2. Suppose that he is innocent, or known to be so, what is his 
right? What is the duty of the one who knows his innocence?)  <p>

Observe that public nuisances, being an injury to the community, are 
subject to similar retributions of justice, and by common law may be 
suppressed or fined. Such are houses of prostitution, gambling houses, 
lotteries, tramps, and vagabonds (Qu.: drinking "saloons"?) (Blackst. 
iv. 168). <p>

<hr><p>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a> NOTE ON ARREST. -- A warrant from a justice of the peace is 
preferable to a private arrest if the offender be not likely to 
abscond; because if it be erroneously granted, no action lies against 
the party obtaining it unless it be proved that he obtained it 
maliciously. The warrant, however, is limited by the jurisdiction of 
the magistrate who issues it. <p>

By common law, a justice of the peace, a sheriff, a coroner, or any 
peace-officer, may arrest any person on reasonable charge of felony 
presented to him, or if he himself witness any suspicious act (Blackst. 
iv. 291). But where a felony is actually committed, any private  person 
may arrest the felon, and is bound to do so. Even on reasonable ground 
of suspicion he may do so, though he is liable to action for assault 
and false imprisonment. Any private person may interfere to prevent a 
felony, and may apprehend and detain the one attempting it (page 293). <p>

(Qu.: Disturbance in church?) <p>
