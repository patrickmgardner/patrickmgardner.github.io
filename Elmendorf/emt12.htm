<h2>PART III. -- THE CARDINAL VIRTUES.</h2>  <p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.  PRUDENCE AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Prudence.</h4><p>

<i>What is prudence?</i><p>

It is a virtuous habit of the practical reason by which one judges 
rightly of the future from the past and the present. The prudent man 
considers what is to come as aiding or impeding what is immediately to 
be done. Prudence judges of the means for the end which is sought. 
Reason gives this counsel; on it follows the choice of the will. <p>

There may be an application of practical judgment to some special end, 
making a man prudent in that special way; but prudence, taken simply, 
is the habit of right practical judgment respecting a good life. It is 
not wisdom, for that looks to the ultimate and highest cause -- 
<i>i.e.</i>, God; but it is wisdom in a lower sense, wisdom in human 
affairs as human. <p>

To prudence pertains not merely rational consideration, but its 
application to action. And since action is concerned with particulars, 
it is necessary that the prudent man know both the universal principles 
of reason, and those particulars in which he is to act. Those 
particulars may be infinite in number, but experience reduces them to a 
limited number of general rules applicable to most cases which occur. <p>

This is not a question merely of observation by acute senses, but of 
memory and experience, which furnish the materials which practical 
reason uses in its prudent judgments. 
<!--
262 PRUDENCE AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES, [Qu. XLVII. 4, 5, 6, 7.  
--><A NAME="p262"></a><p>

<i>Is prudence a virtue?</i><p>

Recall the definition, "virtue is what makes him that has it good, and 
renders his work good." But the good may be viewed either as that which 
in itself simply is so, or as that which the agent so regards. The good 
viewed as such is the object of the desires. Therefore, if there are 
any habits which give a correct rational view, without relation to 
rectitude of desire, they have less of the nature of virtue, ordaining 
to what is materially good but not under the notion of good. But those 
habits which imply rectitude of desire have more of the idea of virtue 
in them, because they regard the good as good. Now prudence is the 
application of right reason to action, which is not done without right 
desire. Therefore prudence is not only a virtue in the sense in which 
the other intellectual virtues are so, but it is a moral virtue also, 
and numbered among them.  <p>

<i>It is a special virtue clearly distinguished from others by its 
object.</i><p>

As an intellectual virtue it is distinguished from the others, since 
wisdom, knowledge, and understanding concern necessary things; but 
this regards solely contingent things. So, indeed, does art; but that 
concerns external things to be made, as a house or a picture, while 
prudence is concerned with the agent and what he has to do. But it is 
distinguished from the moral virtues by its belonging to another power 
of the soul, the intellectual, not the appetitive.  <p>

<i>Prudence does not prescribe their end to the moral virtues.</i><p>

That belongs to the moral judgment, <i>"synderesis;"</i> but it is the 
office of the former to judge what are suitable means for the attaining 
of those ends. In the government of the passions by moral virtues, it 
judges of the means by 
<!--
Qu. XLVII. 8, 9,10, 13.] PRUDENCE. 263 
--><A NAME="p263"></a>
 which the rational and happy mean may be attained which constitutes 
those virtues (INic. Ethics).  <p>

<i>Its first act is deliberative, taking counsel, inquiring what means 
and circumstances are suitable for the end in view.</i> <p>

Speculative reason may form a theoretical judgment of what should be 
done, along with its attendant circumstances; but practical reason goes 
further, in prescribing and applying to operation what has been 
counselled and judged. This is the principal act of prudence. <p>

Care and vigilance follow as part of the same virtue, not only for the 
private good of one, but for the good of the whole community.  <p>

<i>Can sinners have prudence?</i><p>

There are three sorts of prudence. <p>

(1) Since the prudent man is he who well arranges what is to be done 
for the attainment of some good end, he who skilfully fits his means to 
some bad end has a kind of false prudence. Thus, we may speak of a 
prudent thief, who skilfully manages his plans for stealing and for 
escape from being found out. <p>

(2) There is another sort of prudence which fits the means to a good 
end, but it is imperfect; first, because the good which it takes for an 
end is not the common end of all human life. Such is the prudence of a 
merchant or a ship-captain. This is the prudence of the children of 
this world, who, in their way, may be "wiser than the children of 
light." It may be deficient in another way, when one rightly counsels 
and rightly judges respecting what pertains to the whole life, but does 
not efficaciously prescribe action to himself. <p>

(3) But the third kind of prudence is true and perfect, which rightly 
takes counsel, judges, and prescribes how to attain the good end of the 
whole life. This sinners can
<!--
264 PRUDENCE AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. XLVII. 14, 15. 
--><A NAME="p264"></a>
 not have. But the second, imperfect on account of its particular aim, 
is common to good and bad.  <p>

<i>Is prudence possessed by all who are in a state of grace?</i><p>

All such have charity, and with it come all other Christian virtues; 
and so it is necessary that prudence be in them. For no one has grace, 
unless he is virtuous. But no one can be virtuous unless he have 
prudence. For if the other virtues act not prudently in what they seek 
after, they are not entitled to the name of virtues. <p>

(1) Yet such may seem to lack that diligent carefulness by which they 
provide well for what is to be done. Yes; but understand that we are 
speaking now of that prudence which concerns what is necessary to 
salvation, of which S. John said (1 Ep. ii. 27), "His anointing 
teacheth you concerning all things." <p>

(2) But many, you say, who have grace need to be guided by others' 
counsel. Yet they, in this very thing at least, know how to counsel 
well for themselves, in that they seek others' counsel, and distinguish 
the good from the bad. <p>

(3) Again, it may be objected that many young people are in a state of 
grace, and yet the young are not prudent. Acquired prudence, indeed, is 
caused by repeated action, and needs experience and time. And so the 
young cannot have it, either as a habit or actually. But the prudence 
of grace is an infused virtue, given even to baptized infants as a 
habit, though not in actual use. But in those who have the use of 
reason, it is actual so far as concerns what is essential to salvation; 
and through exercise of it as of the other virtues, increase is merited 
until the perfect virtue is gained.  <p>

<i>Prudence is not implanted in us by nature.</i><p>

We have seen that it includes a knowledge of universal principles and 
of particular things to be done to which the prudent man applies those 
universal principles. The com<!--
Qu. XLVII. 16.] PRUDENCE. 265  
 --><A NAME="p265"></a>mon principles of prudence, indeed, are connatural to man; but 
other principles of a practical kind are acquired by experience or 
instruction. <p>

Again, as regards the particular cognition of those things which 
concern action, we must distinguish between what directly concerns the 
end, and what concerns the means to that end. For the right ends of 
human life are fixed and determined. Therefore, there can be a natural 
inclination towards those ends. Some have certain virtues by their 
natural disposition, by which they are inclined to right ends, and, 
consequently, have naturally right judgment respecting those ends. But 
in human affairs the means for the end are not determined, but are 
manifoldly diversified according to the diversity of persons and 
things. hence, since natural inclination is always to some determined 
thing, such knowledge cannot be in man by nature, although from natural 
disposition one may be more apt for discernment of these means than 
another is. Prudence, then, is not a natural virtue. <p>

Brutes seem to have a sort of natural prudence, but they have 
determined ways of reaching the ends of their existence; and so all of 
one species act in the same way (even when the action has become 
useless as means to an end; thus a beaver or a squirrel in captivity 
goes through the usual operations of his instinctive prudence).  <p>

<i>How is prudence lost?</i> <p>

Forgetfulness applies to knowledge only. Science and art may be 
forgotten. But prudence does not consist in knowledge only, but also in 
desire, since its principal act is to prescribe what is to be done; 
i.e., to apply knowledge to seeking and acting. Prudence, therefore, is 
rather corrupted by passions than taken away directly by forgetfulness. 
Yet this can impede the operation of the virtue, inasmuch as it 
prescribes what is to he done from some knowledge which may be lost 
through forgetfulness. 
<!--
266 PRUDENCE AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. LIII. 1.  
--><A NAME="p266"></a>
 "Integral" parts of prudence are such virtues as (a) teachableness, by 
which one carefully, frequently, and reverently applies his mind to the 
teachings of those who have gone before him, neither neglecting them 
through sloth, nor contemning them through pride; (6) foresight, 
circumspection, <i>i.e.</i>, accurate consideration of the 
circumstances of action; and (c) caution, <i>i.e.</i>, careful 
consideration of the attendant evils and impediments of action. <p>

Corresponding to the virtue of prudence is the spiritual gift of 
counsel. For human reason cannot comprehend all the particular and 
contingent events which may occur (especially in connection with the 
Christian life); and therefore his prudence needs to be directed by God 
aiding and perfecting it. <p>

The Decalogue contained no command respecting prudence, because it was 
concerned with the dictates of natural reason, and these chiefly 
concern the ends of human life, not the means for those ends. But 
subsequent documents of the Old Testament added the means to those 
ends, and the perfect Evangelical doctrine instructed man in all that 
pertains to rectitude of life. This, therefore, said (S. Matt. x. 16), 
"Be ye wise (prudent) as serpents."  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Vices opposed to prudence.</h4><p>

<i>Imprudence: is it a sin?</i><p>

The merely negative absence of prudence may exist without sin; but 
privatively, imprudence exists when one lacks the prudence which be is 
fitted to have and ought to have, and this is sin by reason of the 
negligence through which he does not use efforts to obtain this virtue. <p>

And, again, imprudence is to be taken in contradictory signification, 
when reason is moved to acts contrary to prudence, as when right reason 
acts after taking counsel, and the imprudent spurns counsel. In this 
way imprudence is a sin according to the proper idea of prudence. For a 
man 
<!--
Qu. LIII. 4.] VICES OPPOSED TO PRUDENCE. 267 
 --><A NAME="p267"></a>
cannot act contrary to prudence except he turn away from those rules 
by which the prudent is guided aright. If this happen by aversion from 
Divine rules, it is mortal sin, as when one acts precipitately through 
contemning and repudiating the Holy Scriptures. But if the neglect of 
Divine rules is without contempt or detriment to those things which are 
necessary to salvation, it is venial sin. <p>

(1) It may seem that imprudence is not voluntary, and therefore is not 
sin. And it is true that no one wills the deformity of imprudence; but 
yet he who wills to act rashly, wills the imprudent act. <p>

(2) It is true that imprudence is born with man, and that the young are 
naturally imprudent. But this is the merely negative imprudence, which, 
however, is part of that lack of original righteousness which once 
perfected the whole soul, which deficiency is called original sin. <p>

(3) By repentance is restored infused prudence, but not the habit 
acquired by experience. But the contrary act is removed in which 
properly consists the sin. <p>

Various sins are contained under this, as rashness or temerity, 
inconsiderateness of judgment, inconstancy, and negligence. <p>

(1) There are steps by which prudence advances, such as memory of the 
past, consideration of the present, sagacity in viewing the future, 
reflection comparing one thing with another, docility towards the 
judgments of elders. But rashness leaps over all these steps, acting 
under the impulse of will or passion. It is a special form of the sin 
of imprudence. <p>

(2) <i>Inconsiderateness</i> is another special form of this sin, when 
one fails to judge rightly because he despises those things from which 
right judgment proceeds, or neglects to attend to them. The Lord (S. 
Matt. x. 19) forbade His disciples to be anxious how or what they 
should speak, trusting in the Divine counsel; but to neglect to do what 
we can, expecting Divine aid, seems to be tempting God. 
<!--

--><A NAME="p268"></a><p>

(3) Inconstancy denotes a withdrawal from some proposed good which had 
been resolved upon. Such withdrawal has its beginning, indeed, in the 
desires, for no one changes his purpose except on account of something 
which inordinately pleases him. But this withdrawal is consummated by 
defect in reason, which repudiates what it had rightly accepted. If 
reason does not resist the impulse of passions when it can do so, the 
fault is due to its weakness, not holding firmly to the proposed good 
which it has conceived. Therefore the cornsummation of inconstancy 
pertains to defect of reason; <i>i.e.</i>, to imprudence. These three 
vices are the daughters of lust (<i>"luxuria"</i>), because sensual 
pleasure absorbs the mind and extinguishes the judgment of reason.  <p>

<i>Negligence: is it a special sin?</i><p>

It implies the lack of due care and watchfulness. But every defect of 
due acts us sin. And as that careful vigilance is a special virtue, so 
its opposite is a special sin (especially in those things which 
pertain to our salvation). The matter about which the diligence or the 
negligence is concerned may be any moiral question, but the want of the 
special act of reason which is due constitutes the latter a special 
sin over and above any other which may be present a]so. <p>

Sins of omission pertain to the outward acts which are due, and such 
omission is the effect of negligence, the inward sin which pertains to 
imprudence.  <p>

<i>Can negligence be a mortal sin?</i><p>

Holy Scripture seems to answer that question for us when it says (Prov. 
xix. 116), "He that is careless of his ways shall die." Negligence 
comes from remissness of will which is not anxious to prescribe what it 
ought and in the way it ought. This can be mortal sin in two ways; 
first, as respects that which is omitted through negligence; for 
<!--
269 Qu. LV. 3, 4, 5.] VICES OPPOSED TO PRUDENCE. 
--><A NAME="p269"></a>
 if this be necessary to salvation, whether it be an act or a 
circumstance of the act, there will be mortal sin. And again, if the 
will is so remiss regarding what belongs to God that it totally loses 
charity, such negligence is mortal sin, and this happens especially 
when the negligence follows from contempt. Otherwise, if the negligence 
consist in the omission of some act or circumstance which is not 
necessary to salvation, and if this be not done through contempt, but 
from lack of fervour which is sometimes impeded by some venial sin, 
then the negligence is not mortal but is venial.  <p>

<i>Craftiness: is it a special sin?</i><p>

S. Paul says (2 Cor. iv. 2), "We have renounced the hidden things of 
shame, not walking in craftiness." That answers the question. Sin 
against prudence may have some resemblance to the virtue in two ways: 
either the efforts of reason may be directed to some end which is not 
truly good, but only apparent good; or one in seeking some end, 
whether good or bad, may use, not the true paths, but feigned and 
seeming right. This is craftiness. <p>

(1) This is not the "subtlety" offered to the simple by the Proverbs of 
Solomon (Prov. i. 4). <p>

(2) A good end does not sanctify the bad means.  <p>

<i>Guile (<i>"dolus"</i>)</i> <p>

pertains to the carrying out of crafty designs, chiefly indeed by 
words, but also sometimes by actions. He that meditates evil, tries to 
find the way to fulfil his purpose, and usually the guileful way is an 
easier one than open violence.  <p>

<i>Fraud</i> <p>

also pertains to the carrying out of crafty designs, but if we make any 
distinction between it and guile, it may be that fraud proper has to do 
with actions. 
<!--
270 PRUDENCE AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. LV. 6, 7.  
--><A NAME="p270"></a> <p>

<i>Is it lawful to have solicitude respecting temporal things?</i><p>

The Lord said (S. Matt. vi. 31), "Be not anxious, saying, What shall we 
eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?" 
Solicitude leads to anxious endeavour to obtain something. Where there 
is fear of failing, there is more zealous endeavour; but where there 
is security respecting the end, there is less solicitude. So, then, 
this anxiety about temporal things may in three ways be unlawful: (1) 
On the side of what we are anxious about, if we seek temporal things as 
our end; (2) on the side of the anxiety, if it be such as to withdraw a 
man from those spiritual things which he ought chiefly to follow; "the 
care of the world chokes the word" (S. Matt. xiii. 22); (3) on the 
side of the needless fear, when one fears lest necessaries fail him 
through doing what he ought to do. This fear the Lord excludes by three 
arguments addressed to his timid disciple: first, that greater benefits, 
without any anxiety of his, are Divinely conferred, viz., on soul and 
body; next, that God provides for beast and plant without human labour; 
and lastly, that it is ignorance of Divine Providence which makes an 
infidel, an atheist, or a heathen man anxious about this world's goods. <p>

(1) Man, by Divine ordinance, has the use of this world, but not that 
he may make it the end of his life. <p>

(2) Man must work in order to live; but this is moderated care, not 
superfluous anxiety.  <p>

<i>May one be anxious for the future?</i><p>

The Lord answers (S. Matt. vi. 34), "Be not anxious for the morrow." No 
work can be virtuous unless it be clothed with due circumstances, among 
which is the fit time. "There is a time to every purpose which is under 
the heaven." Each day brings with it its own proper care, the time to 
plant or the time to reap. If in the time of planting one is anxious 
about the harvest, that may be the superfluous care which the Lord 
prohibited. "Sufficient 
<!--
Qu. LV. 7.] VICES OPPOSED TO PRUDENCE. 271 
--><A NAME="p271"></a>
 unto the day is the evil thereof;" <i>i.e.</i>, the trouble and care. <p>

This does not prohibit prudence with respect to the future, providing 
what is needed for the future, since Christ Himself taught us that by 
His example (S. John xii. 6). <p>

These vices of craftiness, guile, fraud, and inordinate anxiety are 
especially the daughters of avarice.
