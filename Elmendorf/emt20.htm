<h3>CHAPTER I.  CONSCIENCE.</h3><p>

CONSCIENCE, as a question belonging to psychology, was discussed by S. 
Thomas Aquinas in Pars Prima, lxxix. 12, 13. He found in man a habit of 
practical reason (<i>"synderesis"</i>) by which we know the primary 
principles of things which are to be done; <i>e.g.</i>, that good is to 
be followed and evil to be shunned. What that moral good and evil are 
is to be otherwise determined. But the act by which we apply to our own 
conduct our knowledge of good and evil, whether our judgment be correct 
or incorrect, is called conscience. In this act man testifies to 
himself respecting himself, holds himself bound or absolved, approves 
or condemns his own actions.  <p>

<i>Divisions.</i> Conscience is correct or erroneous; certain or 
doubtful; scrupulous or lax. <p>

<i>An erroneous conscience</i> dictates falsely -- <i>i.e.</i>, 
contrary to objective and binding law -- through ignorance of that law. 
(On ignorance in this regard, see Introduction, pages 12, 92, 466, 
seq.) <p>

<i>A correct conscience</i> testifies, judges, approves, etc., in 
accordance with the objective law as it truly is. But it has only moral 
certainty in its judgments. Both a correct conscience and one 
invincibly ignorant, as we have seen, are to be followed, for it is 
always sin to act against one's conscience, whether it be correct or 
erroneous (Rom. xiv. 23 -- see Bishop Sanderson's excellent sermon on 
this text). But there may be sin in using its permission, since 
vincible error is wilful and sinful error. "The conscience hath power 
in obligations and necessities, but not so much nor 
<!--

--><A NAME="p500"></a>
 so often in permissions" (Duct. Dubitant. I. i. rule 7; I. iii. rule 
2). <p>

But duty requires that one should earnestly and steadfastly seek for 
that outward light which illuminates conscience to see the right path 
for conduct (Whewell, El. Moral. iii. 365).  <p>

When should the priest enlighten an erring conscience? (See Supplement, 
page 599.) If the error be probably invincible, and the erroneous 
opinion which has been followed be consistent with a state of grace, 
the error must be opened or not according to prudent consideration of 
the person and his affairs. But let the priest beware of converting 
material sin into "formal" sin; and also of "casting pearls before 
swine" (Duct. Dubitant. I. iii. rule 8; I. iv. rule 14; op. Rom. vii. 
7; 1 Tim. i. 13).  <p>

<i>A doubtful conscience</i>. Only a few words can here be added 
respecting that wide subject in Moral Theology known as "probabilism." 
Since opinion, with its uncertain judgments founded on fallible 
arguments, and with apprehension of a possible opposite, must often be 
our only guide to the right, and since in such a case we are compelled 
to act without moral (subjective) certainty that we are right in our 
choice of action, a few well-settled principles may be a useful clue in 
our difficult course. <p>

(1) Where there is obligation of obtaining a determined end, it is not 
lawful to reject the surer and safer means of reaching it in order to 
follow what will probably enable us to reach that end. <p>

This condemns, e.g., the popular Protestant sentiment, "We are all 
travelling to the same place, and it matters not what road we take." 
Again, the priest must apply this rule where questions arise respecting 
sacraments "generally necessary to salvation." <p>

Again, this rule prohibits the physician's trying exper<!--

 --><A NAME="p501"></a>iments on his patient if the healing art provide remedies which are 
morally certain to have good effect (Duct. Dubitant. I. iv. rule 3; I. 
v. rule 5). <p>

(2) When the question is of the existence of an obligation or a law, a 
probable opinion may be followed, even if it be not the safer one, for 
an uncertain law does not bind conscience. <p>

This moral principle, <i>e.g.</i>, is calculated to meet a specious 
argument for perverting to the Roman communion -- <i>sc.</i>, "You are not 
morally certain that it has no claim on you; but you admit that 
submission to the Roman see is the safer course." Unless you are morally 
certain that duty requires you to leave your religion and join that or 
any other, you sin in doing so. Therefore, you imperil your salvation by 
a course. <p>

(3) Note here the difference between uncertainty of the law and 
uncertainty of the fact; for in the latter case the rule is precisely the 
opposite. In doubt whether you have filled an obligation under the law, 
that law may still be binding respecting that obligation. <p>

(4) In doubt or uncertainty you may act on presumption if you were 
possessed of moral certainty. <i>"Melior est conditio possidentis."</i> <p>

(5) If the principal and most essential fact be certain, but you are 
doubtful respecting other circumstances or necessary conditions, you 
may act upon probability; doubt is to be decided favorably. <p>

(6) Decide, then, in favour of liberty if there be no contrary 
presumption, and the public good put no obstacle in the way of that 
liberty. But observe that civil law may be stricter than the moral law 
in this respect; <i>e.g.</i>, in questions connected with the 
matrimonial contract. <p>

(7) In doubtful cases, favours are to be regarded liberally, and 
extended as far as possible; penalties, on the other hand, are to be 
construed strictly; <i>e.g.</i>, in case of an ecclesiastical trial.

Conscience may be <i>perplexed</i>, being compelled to choose between 
two evils. But observe the ambiguity in our proposition. If the "evils" 
be sins, you are not allowed to choose either of them; both must be 
rejected. But, on the other hand, the evils may be results of sins 
between which (<i>"mala paenae"</i>) you are compelled to choose. Then 
applies the maxim, "Of two evils choose the least" (Sanderson's 
Praelect. ii. 18; Duct. Dubitant. I. iv. rule 3; I. v. rule 8). <p>

The choice, <i>e.g.</i>, may lie between continuing in a corrupted 
church and implicitly favouring apostasy and unbelief. <p>

Again, a wife may have to choose between condoning a husband's 
infidelity to her by living with him, or breaking up a family. <p>

Remember, also, that laws are of four different grades (page 503), and 
that the lower must always yield to the higher. <p>

Ductor Dubitant. I. v. rule 8, defends the opinion that a lesser sin 
may be made a counsel to him who is bent upon a greater one. Thus, 
Pilate might rightly have counselled the Jews to scourge the Lord and 
let Him go; "not absolutely, but comparatively; that is, rather that 
than the other (the crucifixion), if ye will do one" of them.  <p>
