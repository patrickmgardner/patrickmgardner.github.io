<h3>CHAPTER II.  SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES ON LAW.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. General principles.</h4><p>

Conscience, as the internal rule of human acts, needs an external 
guide, and law is this guide. And since God alone is the all-sufficient 
guide of man, all law is grounded on the Divine law. The atheist is the 
true "anomist." But that Divine law is communicated to man under human 
conditions, through human agents. Thus there are four grades of law 
binding conscience (a) <i>per se simpliciter, i.e.</i>, absolutely, the 
command of God, as His command; (b) <i>per se</i>, but not 
<i>simpliciter</i>, human law given by a superior who possesses 
authority; (c) <i>per se</i>, but not <i>simpliciter</i> (for this and 
the next can be changed), law proceeding from self, in vows and 
promises; (d) <i>per accidens</i> (variable according to time and 
place), the law of avoiding scandal (<i>q.v.</i> page 253). (See 
Sanderson's Praelect. iv. 6.)  <p>

Although affirmative laws always imply a negative prohibition, and 
negative prohibitions imply a positive command, yet there is an 
essential distinction between them as such. The negative law is always 
obligatory, while the affirmative law is only so under its appropriate 
conditions. This principle is universal in casuistry, and of great 
practical importance. (See Duct. Dubitant. 11. iii. rule 1,  13, 14.)  <p>

The "law of nature," the Divine will manifested by the natural light of 
reason, teaching what can be derived from right reason (the subject of 
Moral Philosophy), has for its 
<!--
504 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES ON LAW. 
--><A NAME="p504"></a>
 object all that agrees with, or is necessary for, a rational creature. <p>

Its three fundamental precepts are <i>"honeste vivere, alterum non 
laedere, suum cuique tribuere"</i> (Instit. 1. i. 3), "to hurt nobody by 
word or deed, to be true and just in all my dealings." <p>

Distinguish carefully, however, (a) these primary and unchangeable 
principles of the law of nature; (b) immediate deductions from them as 
in the Decalogue; (c) remoter inferences in which differences of 
judgment may arise. <p>

Every rational man is possessed of the first and second of these as a 
promulgated law (Rom. ii. 15; see also Sanderson's Praelect. iv. 24).  <p>

Ignorance of laws like these, which one is bound to know, is no excuse 
for their violation. This also is an established principle in the 
civil and the common law. "Ignoratio legis quam quisque tenetur scire 
neminem excusat." <p>

Ignorance of the fact which comes under the law is a valid excuse.  <p>

A doubtful law does not bind conscience, and liberty may be used, if no 
other principle forbid. Here applies the maxim, <i>"Melior est conditio 
possidentis."</i><p>

But where there is doubt of the abrogation of a certain law, according 
to the same maxim, we must stand by the law. <p>

Also, in doubt of fact under the law, we must stand by the law; 
<i>e.g.</i>, we are certain of a debt, but not certain that it has been 
paid; then we are bound to pay it.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Human law.</h4><p>

Though human laws under their requisite conditions are binding in 
conscience (Introd. page 131; Rom. xiii. 5), they have no right over 
judgment; <i>i.e.</i>, they demand only out<!--
HUMAN LAW. 505 
 --><A NAME="p505"></a>ward obedience with a willing mind, both in public and in private 
(Col. iii. 23). <p>

In the authority to make laws is implied not only the laying down 
deductions from the law of nature, but also the binding on conscience 
things otherwise indifferent, "positive laws" (Duct. Dubitant. III. i. 
rule 1, &sect; 13).<p>

Conditions requisite in the law-maker are (a) the authority must be 
competent to make a law; (b) the matter must not transcend the limits 
of the authority, <i>e.g.</i>, religion and conscience in the case of civil 
law, the secular life in the case of ecclesiastical law (Qu.: Has the 
state authority to make laws respecting education?); (c) the law-maker 
must not be legislating for the advantage of a clique, "or trust," or 
for other undue ends. <p>

Conditions requisite in human law. The thing commanded must be (a) 
possible; (b) not immoral, for human laws are not obligatory if they 
are not just and good, <i>i.e.</i>, if they violate the higher law of 
nature; (c) useful to the community (1 Tim. ii. 2); (d) not unequal in 
application to the subjects of the law (Duct. Dubitant. III. i. rule 3; 
Sanderson's Praelect. v. &sect; 7); (e) permanent and universal, not a 
<i>"privilegium"</i>; (f) promulgated, not an <i>"ex post facto"</i> 
law (Duct. Dubitant. III. i. rule 6), for the subject of the law must 
have opportunity of knowing it if he will. Otherwise there may be a 
civil offence, but there is no sin, because the ignorance is 
invincible; and invincible ignorance, like physical or moral 
incapacity, excuses violation of law. This applies even to the Gospel 
law (S. John xv. 22). (Qu.: Does positive law, if unequal, bind in 
conscience? Sanderson's Praelect. ix.  9-11.) <p>

What was said (Introd. page 133), that human law is not binding when 
<i>per accidens</i> serious injury will result and no manifest good 
will come from it (see also Sanderson's Praelect. vi. 8), is also true 
of Divine positive law (Duct. 
<!--
506 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES ON LAW. 
--><A NAME="p506"></a>
 Dubitant. III. i. rule 2, &sect; 8), but not of the law of nature. But 
the principle applies equally to civil and ecclesiastical law; 
<i>e.g.</i>, promises of aid to the Church, if meanwhile relatives fall 
into need; rubrics of the Church, etc. <p>

The application of law, <i>e.g.</i>, judicial sentence, founded on 
false presumption of fact, does not bind conscience. (Qu.: What means 
may be used to escape from the law?) <p>

But in all these cases, <i>per contra</i>, scandal must be avoided. <p>

To justify evasion, (a) the matter must be serious; (b) the injustice 
certain; (d) the law must be against the public good, not merely 
inconvenient for the individual.  <p>

Interpretation of the law may be by (a) the legislator himself; (b) by 
experts, <i>e.g.</i>, judges; (c) by custom. Words are to be taken in 
their ordinary and usual meaning if nothing absurd or unjust follow. In 
doubt consider (a) the intention of the legislator; (b) the object of 
the law (c) the concomitant or subsequent circumstances (Duct. 
Dubitant. III. vi.). <p>

Penal law is to be narrowed as far as possible, and not to be extended 
to parallel cases; favourable law, on the other hand, is to be 
amplified by "parity of reasoning." <p>

Laws also founded on the law of nature, <i>e.g.</i>, the fifth 
commandment, extend to all cases which are similar, or have equal or 
similar reason, when such is the law's evident intent (Duct. Dubitant. 
III. vi. rule 3, &sect; 24). On equity see Part III. page 397. <p>

Human law loses its force (a) when it is formally abolished; (b) when 
the motive for its establishment comes to an end (Duct. Dubitant. III. 
vi. rule 3); (c) through desuetude, implying tacit consent of the
 law-maker (Qu. Canon law?). But when the end does not apply in special 
cases, those cases are not released from the obligation of the law 
(<i>ib.</i> &sect; 4).

On Dispensation the rigorist view will be found in Sanderson, Do Jur. 
Oblig., vii. &sect; 3. But see, <i>per contra</i>, the case of rash 
vows as treated by him.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. Ecclesiastical law.</h4><p>

This directs the Church for the common spiritual good and for eternal~ 
beatitude. The authority to make laws which bind conscience is implied 
in the existence of a divinely instituted society; Christian sects 
cannot possess it.  And, conversely, the existence of such Divine laws 
implies the existence of one visible and apostolic Church (S. Matt. 
xvi. 19, xxiii. 2; 5. Luke x. 16; 5. John xx. 23; Heb. xiii. 17). <p>

When the old law, ceremonial and judicial, was abrogated, the natural
 -- the moral -- law remained unchanged and unchangeable. But while the 
new (the evangelic law) makes the remote deductions from the law of 
nature become clearer, its peculiar characteristic is that it is a law 
of love and grace -- the law of a snpernatural life (Sanderson's 
Praelect. iv. 26, 32). <p>

It is (a) moral, including the three theological virtues; (b) 
ceremonial, <i>e.g.</i>, the Holy Eucharist; (c) a law of counsels of 
perfection (see Introd., page 151). <p>

Positive laws of apostolic origin, <i>i.e.</i>, of purely external 
order, are binding only so far as the Church has perpetuated them; 
<i>e.g.</i>, concerning eating blood and things strangled; widows of 
four-score; women speaking in church; the uncovered head in church; 
bishops not novices (S. Ambrose), etc. <i>A fortiori</i>, this 
principle will apply to primitive canons.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. Civil law.</h4> <p>

Civil law directs earthly societies to the common good of such 
communities. It is (a) the Roman law (the civil law in narrower sense 
of the word), based on Justinian's Code, the Institutes (elements), the 
Digest or Pandects, and the Novellae; it is (b) the unwritten law of the 
Teutonic races, 
<!--
508 SUPPLEMENTARY NOTES ON LAW. 
--><A NAME="p508"></a>
 on which are based the decisions of courts, thus originating the 
common law;<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> and (c) it is enactments of the legislatures of the 
state or the nation, which have sometimes boldly deviated from the 
common law. <p>

The aim of civil law being the temporal good of the community, that 
good may require the toleration of moral evil; <i>i.e.</i>, like the 
law of Moses, it may overlook certain forms of evil which are not 
inconsistent with the preservation of society. (See Introd., page 129.) 
Or, again, though not prohibited, they may be put under such 
regulations as reduce them to the narrowest possible limits; 
<i>e.g.</i>, high license for the sale of distilled liquors;
 gambling-houses; stews under the Papacy (Sand. Praelect. vi. 18). <p>

(May not a "license" for such things be viewed as an annual fine?) <p>

Within its due limits civil law is binding on conscience, but ceases to 
be so if it be allowed to fall into desuetude. This, of course, is not 
true if the law be intrinsically bad; for whatever is certainly 
forbidden by the law of nature cannot be enjoined by civil law, and 
whatever the law of nature commands -- <i>e.g.</i>, the care and 
education of children -- cannot be taken away or forbidden by the civil 
law which is only indirectly Divine (Duct. Dubitant. II. i. rule 10). 
But although civil law may not interfere with natural duties, it may 
restrain natural rights (<i>ib.</i> &sect; 5). <p>

Laws "purely penal" bind conscience only to the penalty; <i>i.e.</i>, a 
right conscience may choose between obedience and submission to the 
penalty, <i>e.g.</i>, "Five dollars fine for" etc. But "mixed penal" 
laws bind to obedience, and not  
<!--
CIVIL LAW. 509 
--><A NAME="p509"></a>
 merely to a penalty for disobedience. If the penalty be just, that 
binds conscience after sentence, not before; <i>i.e.</i>, we ard bound 
to yield to that penalty and not evade it (Sand. Praelect. viii. 17, 
24). <p>

Unwritten law, or custom, under due conditions can obtain the force of 
law, abrogate, modify, or interpret old law. (See S. Aug. quoted in 
Duct. Dubitant. II. iii. 19.) <p>

The requisite conditions are (a) the custom must be good, and useful to 
the community; (b) it must rest upon repeated, voluntary, and public 
acts of the community, implicitly intended as binding; (c) the custom 
must have been long continued, without authoritative protest. <p>

Custom under law certainly aids in its interpretation (Duct. Dubitant. 
III.. vi. rule 6); but if it be plainly against the law, the law 
prevails, although the tacit consent of the law-makers may make that 
contrary custom a virtual revocation of the law, if it be revocable. 
No custom, however, can change laws which in their nature do not admit 
of change. <p>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a></a> Civil and canon law, although they do not always agree between 
themselves, came into conflict with the common law in England,  
especially under King Stephen (12th cent.), when the civil law was 
brought thither. <i>E.g.</i>, in the question of the legitimation of 
bastards, the canon Law mercifully allows it upon the marriage of the 
parents; but the laity in Parliament said, <i>"nolumnus Angliae leges 
mutare"</i> (Blackst. Introd. page 19). <p>
