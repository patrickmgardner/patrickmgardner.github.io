<h3>CHAPTER II.  JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE.</h3><p>

(See Supplement, Chapters <A HREF="emt22.htm">IV.</a> and 
<A HREF="emt23.htm">V.</a>)<p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Right.</h4><p>

<i>Right (jus) is the object of justice, for it is what is just.</i><p>

Now it is peculiar to justice among the virtues that it ordains man in 
those things wherein he is related to another man, Other virtues 
perfect him in what belongs to himself; but in just action, the right 
considers not only the agent, but also another person. For that is 
called just action in which there is a certain relative equality, as 
when work is paid for with its due wages. The just action does not 
necessarily regard the manner in which the thing is done (<i>e.g.</i>,
whether freely or not). And thus justice is distinguishable from other 
virtues. <p>

Because justice implies a certain equality, and we can recompense God 
by no equivalent for His bounty, properly speaking, justice is between 
man and man; yet justice tends to this, that man requite His Heavenly 
Father as much as he is able, by entire subjection of his soul to God.  <p>

<i>Right is either natural or positive right.</i><p>

One thing may be adequate to another, (1) according to its very nature, 
as when any one gives as much as he has received. This is natural 
right. (2) It may be adequate or commensurate according to some compact 
or common agreement, when one deems himself compensated if he receive 
so much. This may be either a private agreement between two 
individuals, or it may he by public consent, the 
<!--
Qu. LVII. 2.] RIGHT. 273 
--><A NAME="p273"></a>
 whole people, with or without legal ordinance, agreeing that some one 
thing is adequate and commensurate to another. <p>

(1) But it might be objected that what is natural is immutable, and is 
the same among all men; but no such thing is found in human affairs, 
because all the regulations of human right are defective in some cases 
and do not prevail everywhere. And this is true of what has an 
immutable nature; it must be always and everywhere the same. But man's 
nature is mutable, and so what is natural to man can sometimes be 
deficient. Thus it is naturally just and equal that what has been left 
in our charge be returned to its owner; and if human nature were always 
what it should be, this law would be immutable. But because it 
sometimes happens that the will of man is depraved, a case may occur in 
which such deposit is not to be returned; say, if a madman or an enemy 
of the republic demand the arms which he has left with us. <p>

(2) Another objection, whose solution will help in clearing up the 
matter. Positive right proceeds from human will; but such a thing is 
not necessarily just; otherwise the will of man could never be unjust. 
I reply that the will of man, by the common consent of the people, can 
make something to be just where there is no natural repugnance to 
natural justice. Positive right is concerned with such things. "The 
legally just is that which in the beginning might have been thus or 
thus, and it mattered not which. But when it is decreed, then it does 
matter" (Nic. Eth. v. 7). But if anything has in itself repugnance to 
natural right, it cannot be made just by human will; say, if it be 
decreed lawful to steal or to commit adultery. "Woe unto them that 
decree unrighteous decrees" (Isa. x. 1). <p>

(3) Divine right (<i>jus divinum</i>) is divisible in the same way. It 
is what is promulgated by God. But that is partly what is naturally 
just, though its justice may not be seen is 
<!--
274 JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. [Qu. LVIII. 1, 2, 1, 4. 
--><A NAME="p274"></a>
 by all men; partly what is made just by Divine institution. <p>

In Divine law, accordingly, some things are commanded because they are 
good, and others prohibited because they are bad; but some things also 
are good because they are commanded, and others bad because they are 
prohibited (a very noteworthy distinction).  <p>

<i>What is jus gentium?</i><p>

The law of nature (<i>jus naturale</i>) is what nature teaches all 
animals, as the union of male and female, and the bringing up of 
children (Instit. i., tit. ii.), but the <i>jus gentium</i> is what 
natural reason has established among all men, which needs no special 
institution, and is found among all nations. <p>

The rights of a father in respect to his children, and of a master over 
his servants, are to be distinguished from simple right. Servants and 
children are, as it were, a part of father and master (<i>i.e.</i>, 
their time, work, etc., are not absolutely their own). As human beings, 
they have their individual rights; but as under another, justice, taken 
simply, does not express what is their due, but an imperfect justice 
based on their peculiar relations to father or master. For the relation 
is not the simple relation of one person to another, but is based on 
the special relation in these cases.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Justice.</h4><p>

Justice is a constant and perpetual will to render to every one his 
right (Instit. i., tit. i).  <p>

<i>Justice is a virtue which concerns our relations to others.</i><p>

Its seat is in the will. It pertains to this virtue to rectify human 
actions, establishing an equality in the relations of one to another. 
This rectification makes a man so far good and his work good, which 
effect ranks justice among the virtues. And it is a virtue of the will, 
not of the intellect, because it does not direct our knowledge but 
rectifies 
<!--
Qu. LVIII. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.] JUSTICE. 275 
--><A NAME="p275"></a>
 our action. It is not a virtue of sense-appetite, because that does 
not consider our mutual relations, nor is it capable of being disposed 
to render every one his right.  <p>

<i>Distinguish general justice, "legal justice," from private or 
particular justice.</i><p>

Justice ordains man in relation to others. But this may be in relation 
to another individual, or to the community of which he is a part. As a 
general virtue it orders the acts of all virtues for the common good, 
just as charity orders them for Divine good, and this is also a general 
virtue. I call this general justice "legal justice" because by it man 
is in harmony with law, whose function it is to direct man's actions 
for the common good. <p>

It is distinct from the virtues which it orders for the common good, 
because they have their immediate end, which is different from this 
higher end of the public good which general or legal justice gives 
them. <p>

But man also needs to be ordered in his actions towards other 
individuals; hence there is also particular (or private) justice. Its 
special object is not the inward passions, which need other rectifying 
virtues, but those outward actions and those outward things by which 
men have intercourse with one another. Inward passions, in their 
effects -- <i>sc.</i>, outward operations -- may extend to others, but 
they do not in themselves so extend; this is peculiar to justice.  <p>

<i>Justice is not directly concerned with the passions of the soul.</i><p>

This we have already seen; the subject of justice is the will; its 
matter, the things in which we are related to one another. But further 
explanation may be given of the relation between justice and inward 
passions. Actions are intermediate between outward things which are the 
object of those actions and the passions from which those actions 
spring. Sometimes there may be defect in one of those 
<!--
276 JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. [Qu. LVIII. 12. 
--><A NAME="p276"></a>
 without defect in the other; as if any one take another's property, 
not with desire of getting it, but with a wish to do him harm; or, 
conversely, if he desire what is another man's, but does not will to 
steal it. The rectification of actions, therefore, so far as the 
outward part is concerned, belongs to justice; but the rectification of 
those actions in the inward part belongs to other moral virtues which 
are concerned with the passions. Thus justice prevents stealing as 
being against that equality which is to be preserved in outward things; 
but liberality prevents it as it proceeds from immoderate lust of 
riches. <p>

It is especially legal justice, which is ordained for the common good, 
which extends to the inward passions of the soul, since the good of the 
whole is the end of each member of the whole. But even legal justice is 
chiefly concerned with the outward operations of those virtues which 
concern the passions, such actions coming within the scope of law. So 
law may punish cowardice, intemperance, cruelty, etc., if they show 
themselves in action (Nic. Eth. v. 2). <p>

The proper act of justice is to render to each one what is his.  <p>

<i>Justice is preeminent among moral virtues.</i> <p>

This is manifestly true of general, legal justice, because the common 
good is of more importance than the good of any individual. But even 
particular justice has the same preeminence for two reasons; first, it 
is in the nobler part of the soul, the rational appetite -- 
<i>i.e.</i>, the will; while the other moral virtues belong to
 sense-appetite and its passions. And, in the second place, while those 
virtues have for their object the good of one person, justice aims also 
at the good of another. Justice ranks even above liberality; for in 
considering the common good, the former extends to all who are related, 
while liberality does not; and liberality which gives of one's own 
must be founded on justice which gives what is due. 
<!--
Qu. LIX. 1, 2, 3.] INJUSTICE. 277  
--><A NAME="p277"></a><p>

<h4>&sect; 3. Injustice.</h4><p>

<i>Is it a special vice?</i><p>

There are two kinds of injustice. The first is illegal, opposed to 
legal justice. This is a special vice, for it has a special object; 
<i>sc.</i>, the general good which it contemns. But in its aim it is 
rather a general vice than a special one; for through contempt of the 
general good man can be led into all kinds of sins; and all vices, as 
repugnant to the general good, have the nature of injustice, are 
derived from it. <p>

The other kind of injustice is based on inequality towards another, 
when one wishes to have more of good things than is just -- say, riches 
and honours; and fewer evils -- say, labours and losses. In this way 
injustice has its own special matter, and is a special vice opposed to 
private justice. <p>

Private injustice is opposed, indeed, indirectly to all virtues, as 
regards their outward acts. Thus it is opposed to chastity in the act 
of adultery, to kindness in the act of homicide, etc.  <p>

<i>Who is an unjust man?</i><p>

Not always he who does an unjust action. For, first, if he did not 
intend to do an unjust thing, the action does not make him unjust 
<i>per se</i>, but <i>per accidens</i>. The action is unjust, but it is 
not unjustly done; it is not a wrong, an injury (<b>adik&ecirc;ma</b>). 
Secondly, the wrong may proceed from some passion, as anger or 
concupiscence; or it may be deliberately done, when the wrong <i>per 
se</i> gives pleasure. In this latter case it proceeds from a habit. 
But to do an unjust action from intention and choice is the mark of an 
unjust man. He is called unjust who has the habit of injustice. But 
unintentionally, or from passion, one may do an unjust action without 
having a habit of injustice.  <p>

<i>Can any one willingly suffer wrong?</i><p>

<i>"Scienti et volenti non fit injuria."</i> A man properly and <i>per 
se</i> does that which he willingly does; and he 
<!--
278 JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. [Qu. LIX. 3. 
--><A NAME="p278"></a>
 properly suffers that which he suffers contrary to his will because so 
far as he is willing, he is rather active than passive. No one, then, 
can, properly speaking, do a wrong unless he wills it, nor suffer a 
wrong unless he be unwilling. But, <i>per accidens</i>, and according 
to the "material" part of the action, one can unwillingly do that which 
is <i>per se</i> unjust, as when he acts against his intention; or he 
can willingly suffer an injustice, as when he of his own will gives to 
another more than is due. <p>

(1) You may say that one can "rob himself," so violate equality, and 
suffer injustice. But when any one of his own free will gives another 
that which is not due, there is neither injustice nor inequality. For a 
man has property through his own will, and so there is no "injury" 
when anything is subtracted from it according to his own will, either 
by himself or by another. <p>

(2) But you may say that civil law punishes nothing which is not 
unjust; and yet it deprives suicides of honorable interment. So one can 
willingly do injustice to himself. But I reply that man has a two-fold 
position in this world; and one of these positions concerns himself 
alone; and so, if he does any harm to himself, it may be some other 
sin, as intemperance or imprudence, but it is not injustice. <p>

But also man may be considered as a part of society, or as the creature 
and image of God. And so he who kills himself does an injury to the 
state and to God. Therefore both Divine and human laws inflict a 
penalty. <p>

(3) Another objection. No one does an unjust thing unless there be some 
one who suffers that injustice. (The two are correlative.) But he may 
do an unjust thing to one who wills it, as when he sells a thing for 
more than it is worth. So it seems that one can willingly suffer 
injustice. But I reply that in the doing and the suffering an unjust 
thing, we may look at the "material" part, the outward action 
considered in itself. In this respect, the 
<!--
Qu. LX. 1.] JUDGMENT. 279
--><A NAME="p279"></a>
doing and the suffering are always concomitant. But again we may look 
at the will and intention, the "formal" part of the action. In this 
regard one may do an unjust thing intending to do such a thing, and yet 
the other may not suffer injustice because he willingly allows the 
action. (Thus, in a case of fraud in a bargain, one may pay the 
excessive price, intending to make a donation of the excess to the 
cheat.) And, conversely, one may unjustly suffer, because he 
unwillingly suffers that which is unjust; and yet he who does the 
action will not be acting unjustly, because he is ignorant of the 
nature of what he does.  <p>

<i>Whoever does an unjust action is guilty of mortal sin.</i><p>

He directly violates the law of God; his act is opposed to charity, 
through which is the life of the soul. For every injury done to another 
is repugnant to charity which wills another's good. <p>

(1) What shall we say of ignorance? Ignorance of the fact, of the 
circumstances, merits pardon; but ignorance of the law does not excuse 
(the laws of justice can generally be known by one who wills to know 
them). But he who ignorantly does an unjust thing, does so only <i>per 
accidens</i>. <p>

(2) What shall we say of very trifling acts of injustice? Possibly some 
such thing may not be, properly speaking, perfect injustice at all; 
for it may be considered to be not altogether contrary to the will of 
him who suffers it; as if any one take an apple or some such thing, 
when there is probably no harm done, nor any displeasure resulting if 
the act be known.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. Judgment.</h4><p>

<i>Judgment is the definition or determination of what is just and 
right.</i><p>

But that any one well determine anything in virtuous acts proceeds from 
a habit of virtue; and therefore judgment is an act of justice. It is 
an act of reason, indeed, 
<!--
280 JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. [Qu. LX. 2. 
--><A NAME="p280"></a>
 perfected by prudence, but a fit disposition for judging rightly is 
also requisite; and so, in what pertains to justice, judgment springs 
from the virtue of justice, as in what pertains to courage it comes 
from that virtue. "He that is spiritual judgeth all things" (1 Cor. ii. 
15), because from charity he has the disposition to judge rightly all 
things according to Divine rules, through the gift of wisdom; as the 
just man, through the virtue of prudence, pronounces judgment out of 
the rules of right. <p>

But the meaning of the term judgment is amplified to embrace right 
determination in any things whatsoever, and in other virtues the 
judgment of him who is virtuous in their regard is required. But when 
we speak of justice, judgment is used in its restricted and proper 
meaning.  <p>

<i>Is it lawful to judge?</i><p>

It is plainly lawful so far as it is an act of justice. But this 
requires three things (1) It must proceed from the disposition to be 
just and to do just actions; otherwise it is against the rectitude of 
justice; it is perverse and unjust. (2) It must proceed from due 
authority, not from judging ]n things where one has no such right; 
otherwise it is usurped judgment. (3) Judgment must be made according 
to rational prudence. When certitude is lacking, as when one judges 
about doubtful or secret things by some light conjectures, such a 
judgment is rash and suspicious. Whichever of these three requisites is 
lacking, the judgment is illicit and vicious. <p>

(1) The Lord said, indeed (S. Matt. vii. 1), "Judge not, that ye be not 
judged." But He prohibits rash judgment, or that which is not of good 
will, but from bitterness of spirit. <p>

(2) S. Paul, also, said (Rom. xiv. 4), "Who art thou that judgest 
another's servant? To his own master he standeth or falleth;" which 
seems to indicate that God is the only 
<!--
Qu. LX. 3.] JUDGMENT. 281 
--><A NAME="p281"></a>
 judge. But judgment may be made by "the minister of God" (Deut. i. 
17). <p>

(3) But the apostle seems to say, again (Rom. ii. 1), that it is not 
lawful for a sinful man to judge; and all are sinners. And this is true 
when the judge's sins are open and similar, or greater; for great 
scandal arises from such judgments. But when the sins are not notorious 
and official duty requires, he can rebuke or judge with humility and 
fear. He does not thus condemn himself with new condemnation, but he 
shows himself worthy of condemnation for the same or like sin.  <p>

<i>Is judgment from suspicion illicit?</i><p>

Suspicion is an evil opinion of another based on light indications or 
proofs. And this arises in three ways: (1) He who is himself an
 evil-doer, conscious of his malice, easily forms a bad opinion of 
others. (2) He may be ill-affected towards another, and, despising or 
hating him, or being angry or envying him, he forms his opinion from 
trifling proofs, because one easily believes what he desires to be 
true. (3) Suspicion results from long experience. "The old are most 
suspicious, because they have had most experience of others' 
deficiencies" (Arist. Rhet. ii. 13). The first two causes of suspicion 
manifestly pertain to perverse affections; but the third cause renders 
the judgment less that of suspicion, inasmuch as experience gives more 
of certitude. Suspicion, then, implies a certain vice, and the further 
the suspicion proceeds, the greater the sin. But there are three grades 
of suspicion: (1) A man from light indications begins to harbour doubt 
about another's goodness. This may be light and venial sin, for it 
pertains to those human temptations from which life cannot be free. (2) 
One from light indications may hold for certain the wickedness of 
another. And if this be in a grave matter, it is mortal sin, for it 
implies contempt of our neighbour. "If we cannot avoid suspicions, 
since we are men, yet we 
<!--
282 JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. [Qu. Lx. 4. 
--><A NAME="p282"></a>
 can and we ought to restrain definite and fixed judgments." (3) A 
judge out of suspicion may proceed to condemn another. This is directly 
an act of injustice, and a mortal sin. <p>

(1) It is true that in particular and contingent things we can never 
have absolute certainty; but we can have that moral certainty which 
results from suitable proofs. <p>

(2) Suspicion, being only in the opinion of the mind, may seem to be 
doing no injury; but if one without sufficient cause has a bad opinion 
of another, he unduly contemns him; therefore he does an injury to 
him. (See 1 Tim. vi. 4.) The inward judgment, as it is related to the 
outward judgment, pertains to injustice in the same way in which anger 
is related to homicide. (The one may be venial, the other is mortal 
sin.)  <p>

<i>Doubts respecting another's wickedness are to be decided in the more 
favourable sense (unless we simply suspend judgment, and "judge not at 
all ").</i><p>

For we have no right to contemn or do injury to another without the 
most cogent reasons. <p>

(1) It may happen that he who puts the most favourable interpretation 
on others' words and actions is oftenest deceived. But it is better 
that one be frequently mistaken in having a good opinion of a bad man 
than that he be more rarely mistaken in having a bad opinion of a good 
man. For injury is done to another by this, but not by the first error. <p>

(2) It is one thing to judge of things, and quite another to judge of 
men. For in judging about things, there is no good or evil done to the 
thing, in whatever way we may judge of it. It is only the good of the 
judge which is in question; the good, if he judge rightly; or the 
evil, if he judge falsely; because the true is the good of reason, and 
the false is its evil. And therefore each one ought to strive to judge 
of things precisely as they are. 
<!--
Qu. LX. 5.] JUDGMENT. 283  
--><A NAME="p283"></a><p>

But, in judging men, the good and evil is chiefly on the side of him 
who is judged, who is deemed worthy of honour if he receive favourable 
judgment, and worthy of contempt if he be judged unfavourably. 
Therefore in such judgment we ought to aim to judge a man to be good 
unless manifest reason for the contrary appear. And if we err in our 
favourable judgment, the error does not pertain to the evil of reason, 
for its perfection is not found in knowledge of particular contingent 
things; but the error rather pertains to well-constituted affections. 
We are not now considering the application of remedies for spiritual 
diseases. There we may assume the worse condition, since the remedy 
which fits that graver disease will suit still more the lighter one.  <p>

<i>Written laws.</i><p>

These are made to set forth either natural right or positive right, but 
not both after the same manner. For written law contains natural right, 
but does not create it; it gets its force, not from the law, but from 
nature; whereas written law both contains and establishes positive 
right, giving it its authority and binding force. Judgment, then, must 
be made according to such law, otherwise it would fall short either of 
natural justice or of positive justice. <p>

(1) Laws, indeed, are sometimes unjust. But, since law gives no force 
to natural right, it cannot take away or diminish the force of that 
right, because man's will cannot change nature. Therefore, if law 
contain anything against natural right, it is unjust, and creates no 
obligation of obedience. Positive law comes in where it makes no 
difference as regards natural right whether the action be done in one 
way or in another. Unjust laws, so called, are properly no laws at all, 
but rather corruptions of law. <p>

(2) No law can comprehend all particular events. In some cases, if the 
law-maker were present, he would judge contrary to the letter of the 
law. The best laws, laws per<!--
284 JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. [Qu. LXI. 1.  
 --><A NAME="p284"></a>fectly just, fail to meet some cases. If they were observed in 
those cases they would be contrary to natural right. In such cases 
judgment is not to be given according to the letter of the law, but 
recourse is to be had to that equity which the law-maker was bound to 
intend. "No consideration of right or benignity of equity endures, that 
what was beneficially introduced for the good of mankind should, by 
severer interpretation, be used against the advantage of those who are 
subject to law." If a just law-maker had considered such cases, he 
would have determined them by just law. (In doubtful cases, recourse is 
to be had to those who have authority to interpret, to judge, to 
decide.)  <p>

<i>Usurped judgment.</i><p>

Since judgment is to be given according to law, he who does so 
interprets the law in applying it to the particular case before him. 
But it belongs to the same authority of government to make law, and to 
interpret it (by practical application enforcing it). Therefore, as law 
can only be made by public authority, so judgment can only be given by 
the same. And so, as it would be unjust that any one should compel 
another to observe some regulation which was not sanctioned by public 
authority, so it is also unjust that any one should compel another to 
submit to judgment which has not the same sanction.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 5. Commutative and distributive justice; restitution.</h4><p>

<i>Divisions of justice.</i><p>

There are two species of particular justice, commutative and 
distributive; for justice, in this sense of the word, directs each 
individual as part of the community. Now part may be related to part -- 
<i>i.e.</i>, one individual to another; and commutative justice directs 
the relations which one man bears to another (as in buying and selling, 
and similar contracts). <p>

But another relation is that of the whole to the several 
<!--
Qu. LXI. 2, 8.] DIVISIONS OF JUSTICE. 285 
--><A NAME="p285"></a>
 parts; that which belongs to the whole community in its relations to 
particular persons. Distributive justice directs this relation, 
assigning the common goods (honours, rewards, etc.) according to a 
certain proportion in dignity and merits.  <p>

<i>In distributive justice the equality of one thing to another is not 
considered, but the proportion of things to persons; so that, as one 
person exceeds another, what is given to the one exceeds what is given 
to the other.</i> <p>

This is the reason why Aristotle spoke of a geometric proportion in 
distributive justice (Nic. Eth., v. 3). For the equality is not that of 
two things, but of two ratios (A's merits are to A's share, as B's 
merits are to B's share). <p>

But in exchange, something is given to one person on account of what he 
has himself given. And, therefore, the one thing must be equal to the 
other, as in buying and selling; and if one have more of the other's 
goods than is equal to what he has given, commutative justice requires 
him to make restitution of the excess. And so a sort of arithmetical 
equality is established. <p>

If we consider punishments, retributive justice, in this light, we 
shall notice that in actions and passions the condition of the persons 
concerned contributes to the quantity of the thing; for greater injury 
is done when a person holding official station is struck than when a 
private person is so injured.  <p>

<i>We may examine commutative justice somewhat more in detail.</i><p>

Justice, as we have seen, is concerned with outward operations; 
<i>sc.</i>, distribution and exchange. These operations concern some 
external things, or persons, or services things, as when one takes away 
or restores another's property; persons, as when one injures another's 
person by striking or slandering him, or on the other hand pays him 
<!--
286 JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. [Qu. LXII. 1. 
--><A NAME="p286"></a>
 proper respect; and lastly, services which may be justly demanded from 
another or rendered to him. <p>

In the exchanges between two persons which commutative justice directs, 
some are voluntary, some are involuntary. They are involuntary when one 
uses the property, the person, or the service of another against his 
consent, secretly through fraud, or openly through violence. Secretly 
one may take another's property, and we shall have the crime of theft; 
or it may be done openly, which is robbery. Personal injustice may be 
directed against one's own person, or against those who belong to us; 
it may be directly against our person, or against our honour and 
reputation. The person may be secretly injured, as by treacherous 
murder -- <i>e.g.</i>, poisoning and the like -- or by open violence. 
Honour and reputation may be secretly injured by detraction, 
backbiting, etc., or by public abuse, false witness, etc. Through those 
belonging to us we may be injured by secret adultery, or by enticing

Voluntary exchanges are of very numerous kinds. If one simply transfer 
his property to another without any obligation so to do, as in a gift, 
it is not an act of justice, but of liberality. Justice implies 
something due, some kind of debt; as in buying, selling, hiring, etc. 
(See, further, Supplement, Chapter <A HREF="emt24.htm">VI.</a>)  <p>

<i>Restitution is an act of commutative justice.</i><p>

To restore is to put another in possession or dominion of his own 
property, according to the equality of justice, whether the thing has 
been possessed with the owner's knowledge and consent, as in a loan or 
deposit, or without that knowledge and consent, asin theft and robbery. 
(It is either a returning of the thing received, or compensation for 
loss.) It is not the mere giving back of a material thing, which may be 
a donation; it implies the obligation to do so, the returning what is 
justly another's. 
<!--
Qu. LXII. 2] RESTITUTION. 287  
--><A NAME="p287"></a><p>

The first meaning of restitution has to do with outward things which 
remain the same, and whose dominion can be transferred from one to 
another. But a secondary signification of the word transfers it to 
actions or passions which concern the honour or injury, the benefit or 
harm of persons. The action may not remain, but its effects abide; 
<i>e.g.</i>, the slanderous word passes away, but the loss of a good 
name is a permanent loss, and demands restitution so far as that is 
possible.  <p>

<i>To restore that which has been unjustly taken away is an indispensable 
requisite of salvation.</i><p>

For only the just man can be saved, and restitution is an indispensable 
act of justice. " Render to all their dues. Owe no man anything but to 
love one another" (Rom. xiii. 7, 8). <p>

(1) Sometimes complete restitution is impossible, as when a limb or 
even life itself has been destroyed. But where the equivalent cannot be 
returned, as in the case of the honour due to God or to parents, there 
the obligation is limited to what is possible. The loss of a limb 
cannot be fully recompensed, yet justice will demand pecuniary 
compensation or other restitution, according to the circumstances of 
the case. <p>

(2) It is objected that one man may take away another's good name by 
saying what is true concerning that other; and he cannot restore a good 
character without telling a lie. But there are three ways in which a 
good name is taken away: (1) When the truth is justly spoken, according 
to the due order of things, and restitution is not due; (2) when the 
words spoken were false and unjust, and the restitution of a good name 
is bounden duty, by a frank confession of the error; (3) when the truth 
was spoken, but unjustly, as when any one betrays the crime of another 
without due warrant for so doing; and he is bound to restore the good 
name, so far as is possible, without telling a lie. One may 
<!--
288 JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. (Qu. LXII. 3. 
--><A NAME="p288"></a>
 truly say that he ought not to have spoken in such a way; that he 
unjustly injured the other's character; or, if he cannot restore a 
good character which he has taken away, and which every man is entitled 
to until it is lawfully taken away, he is bound to make other 
compensation. <p>

(3) Sometimes what is done cannot be undone; unjust insult cannot be 
directly repaired. Yes; but its effects which remain -- <i>sc.</i>, 
loss of respect before men -- may be partly repaired through special 
exhibition of reverence. This is partial restitution. <p>

(4) Suppose one hinder another from obtaining some good -- say, a 
lucrative office; it is like taking it away. Is he bound to make 
restitution? Oftentimes that would be impossible. I answer that one 
might be justly kept out of this office for the honour of God, or the 
good of the Church or of the commonwealth, in order that a more worthy 
person should get that dignity. Of course, in such a case no 
restitution is called for nor any compensation. But this may be 
unjustly done, as through hatred, desire of vengeance, unjust 
prejudice, etc.; and, then, if the worthy be hindered before it has 
been settled that he shall have the office, some compensation is due 
according to the circumstances, but not full restitution, because there 
might have been other hindrances to getting the office besides this 
one. But if the matter have been settled, and any one for improper 
causes procure that the appointment be revoked, it is all one with his 
taking away the good which the other has, and equal restitution is 
obligatory, or compensation to the extent of his ability.  <p>

<i>Is it sufficient simply to restore what has been unjustly taken 
away?</i><p>

Two things are to be considered. First, there is inequality as respects 
the thing in question, which sometimes can exist without injustice, as 
when you him a thing which is to be returned with additional 
compensation for the use of it. 
<!--
Qu. LXII. 4, 5.] RESTITUTION. 289 
--><A NAME="p289"></a>
 So far the remedy for the unjust taking is restitution, which restores 
equality. <p>

But there is, secondly, also the fault of injustice, which can exist 
without the actual taking away; as when one intends to use violence, 
but does not succeed in his attempt. The remedy for this fault is a 
penalty intlicted by the proper judge. Therefore, before condemnation 
by such a judge one is not bound to restore more than he has received; 
but after condenination, he is bound to pay also the damages imposed.  <p>

<i>Is any one ever bound to restore what he has not taken away?</i><p>

Whoever causes loss to another may be said to take away that in which 
the loss is caused, whether he himself gets any advantage from his 
action or not. And, therefore, a man is bound to restitution as far as 
he has caused loss. (See, in Supplement, the case of the possessor in 
bad faith, <A HREF="emt23.htm#p528">chap. V. &sect; 3</a>.) But there are two ways of causing loss. First, 
that may be taken away which one actually has. Such loss is always to 
be restored with equal recompense. Thus, if any one cause loss by 
destroying the house of another, he is bound to as much as the actual 
damage. But, secondly, one may cause loss to another by preventing his 
obtaining what he was in the way of getting. Such damage is not to be 
recompensed according to equality in the thing, because that might be 
giving more than the existing state of things demanded. A future 
possibility is worth less than a present reality ("a bird in hand," 
etc.). Some compensation, however, is due according to the condition of 
persons and things. Thus, if a field he injured which has been already 
sown, the indemnification is not equal to the entire crop expected from 
that field.<p>

Restitution is to be made to the one who has less than his own right 
through the unjust taking away. But (1) the thing restored may be 
evidently very injuri<!--
290 JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. [Qu. LXII. 5.  
 --><A NAME="p290"></a>ous to the receiver or to some one else, as if a drunken man's 
revolver should be put into his hands, because it belongs to him. In 
such a case restitution is not to be made, because it is ordained for 
the benefit of him to whom it is made. But also he who detains 
another's property, even in such cases, has no right to appropriate it 
to himself, but he is bound either to preserve it in order to restore 
it at a fitting season, or else to hand it over to some one else for 
safer keeping. <p>

(2) But it may be said that he who unlawfully gives anything does not 
deserve to receive it back; and sometimes one unlawfully gives what 
another unlawfully receives, as in bribery or simony. Therefore 
restitution is not always to be made to the person from whom a thing 
has been received. But one wrongfully gives anything in either of two 
ways. The giving itself may be wrong and contrary to law, as in giving 
with intent of bribery or simony. Such a giver deserves to lose what he 
has given. He has no claim for restitution; but because he who 
receives does so wrongfully, he ought not to keep anything for himself, 
but to devote it to charitable uses. In another way, one gives 
wrongfully, because he gives for a wrong purpose, although the giving 
itself is not unlawful. (Query, the giving part of one's claim on 
government, when demanded by officials as a condition for just payment 
of the same?) A penitent prostitute would not be required to give back 
all which she had received, however shamefully and wickedly. <p>

(3) Sometimes it is impossible to make restitution to the very person 
concerned, because he is dead, or too far removed, or is not known (as 
in common frauds in trade). As respects the unknown, if diligent 
inquiry give no information, the poor are to be the heirs of that 
unknown owner, an offering being thus made for the good of his soul. If 
he be dead, his lawful heirs take his claim for restitution. If he be 
far distant, there is ordinarily, in these days, no diffi<!--
Qu. LXII. 6.] RESTITUTION. 291  
 --><A NAME="p291"></a>culty in sending to him, or, at least, in notifying him, that his 
rightful claim is waiting his order. <p>

(4) One ought first to recompense those from whom, as from parents, he 
has received the greater benefits. Such benefits are far more than the 
worth of a loan or a deposit. So it may be said; but benefactors cannot 
be recompensed from others' property. If you have what is another's, 
that is first to be returned, except, perhaps, in case of extreme 
necessity of that benefactor, for "necessity knows no law."  <p>

<i>Is he who has received what is another's always bound to make 
restitution?</i>  <p>

He who has sinned is always bound to make satisfaction for his sin. But 
restitution is a satisfaction; therefore it is always obligatory. But 
this principle requires further explication. When one has received what 
is another's, two things are to be considered; the thing received, and 
the act itself of receiving. As regards the first, one is bound to 
restore it, as long as he has it, because what he has over and above 
what is his own ought to be taken away from him and given to him to 
whom it belongs. This is required by commutative justice. <p>

But the taking of the thing may have either of three conditions. For 
(1) sometimes it is an injury when the thing is taken against the will 
of him who has lawful dominion of it, as in theft and robbery. And then 
the taker is bound to restitution not only by reason of the thing, but 
also by reason of the injurious action, even if the thing be no longer 
in his possession. For as he who strikes another is bound to recompense 
that other for the injury, although he himself have now no result from 
the wrong which he has done, so he who steals or robs is bound, to 
recompense for the loss sustained, even if he have no benefit remaining 
from the wrong; and, besides, he ought to be punished for the injury 
done. <p>

(2) In another way, one receives another's property for his own 
advantage without doing any injury, as when he 
<!--
292 JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. [Qu. LXII. 7. 
--><A NAME="p292"></a>
 hires a piano. And then he who receives is bound to restitution not 
only by reason of the thing, but also of the receiving, even if he have 
lost what he borrowed. For he is bound to recompense the one who has 
given him a benefit, which recompense would not be paid, if loss were 
incurred by the lender. <p>

(3) In the third way, one receives what is another's without injury, 
but not for his own benefit, as when a bank takes charge of valuables 
belonging to depositors. He who so receives is not bound by reason of 
the receiving; rather he confers a favour by doing so; but he is bound 
by reason of the thing. Therefore, if the thing be taken from him 
without any fault of his, he is not bound to make restitution; but it 
would be otherwise if he should lose it through gross negligence.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup>  <p>

<i>May those who have not taken be bound to restore?</i><p>

One is bound to make restitution not only by reason of the thing which 
belongs to another, but also by reason of injurious taking of it. And, 
therefore, whoever is the cause of that unjust taking is bound to make 
restitution. He may be the cause directly or indirectly. He is directly 
the cause when he induces another to do the wrong. This direct 
cobperation may be (1) by exhorting or commanding; (2) by counselling; 
(3) by consenting openly, or (4) by praising such an act; (5) by 
sheltering him who unjustly takes what is another's, or by giving him 
assistance; (6) by participation in the theft or robbery, or whatever 
the wrong may be, or by sharing its fruits. <p>

Indirectly he is the cause of the unjust taking when he does not hinder 
it, although he can do so, and ought to do so, either because he (7) 
keeps back the command or counsel which would have prevented the wrong, 
or (8) because he withholds his aid which would have prevented it, or 
(9) because he conceals the fact.
<!--
Qu. LXII. 7.] COOPERATION. 293  
--><A NAME="p293"></a><p>

Five out of these nine modes of cooperation require restitution; and, 
primarily, command, because he who gives his order is the first mover 
in the act, and he, therefore, whether he give his order openly or 
tacitly, is chiefly bound to make restitution; next, consent, in the 
case of him without whom the wrong could not have been committed; 
thirdly, sheltering the wrong-doer; fourthly, participation in the act 
or in its fruits; and lastly, not hindering when duty or office 
requires it. Thus the official guardians of justice are bound to 
restitution if through their negligence wrongs are multiplied. <p>

In the other cases enumerated restitution is not always obligatory, for 
it is not always the case that advice or approbation is the efficient 
cause of the wrong. If it should be so, however, the adviser or the 
applauder before the wrong is done, incurs the same obligation.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup>  
<!--
291 JUSTICE AND INJUSTICE. [Qu. LXII. 8.  
--><A NAME="p291"></a><p>

(1) It is not only he who executes the act, but he who in any way is 
the cause of sin, who is a sinner. <p>

(2) He is principally bound who is principal in the act; viz., first, 
the one who orders, and, next, the one who executes the command; then 
the others in their turn. But if one restore to him who has suffered 
the loss, the others are released from this obligation. But those who 
are principals in the act, and have its fruits, are bound to restore to 
the accessories, if those have made restitution. <p>

But if any one give a command of this nature which is not executed, 
there is no such obligation, since its object is principally to make 
right the loss incurred unjustly. <p>

It may be said that no one is bound to expose himself to grave danger 
in order to preserve another's property, such danger as might be 
incurred by arresting or resisting a robher. But these are cases also 
which do not always demand restitution. It is the official guardians of 
the law (judges, military, police) on whom the obligation rests.  <p>

<i>When is one bound to make restitution?</i><p>

As taking another's property is sin against justice, so also 
<!--
Qu. LXII. 8.] RESTITUTION. 295 
--><A NAME="p295"></a>
 is retaining it. For the owner is wrongfully hindered from its use and 
injury is done to him. It is not permitted to abide in sin for any 
length of time; therefore every wrongdoer is bound to make immediate 
restitution, if he can, or else to ask a delay from him who can grant 
the use of the thing in question. <p>

(1) Affirmative precepts, it is true, do not oblige at all times, but 
this obligation is also negative "Thou shalt not retain what is 
another's." <p>

(2) No one is bound to what is impossible; but he ought to ask for 
remission or delay respecting the obligation, either personally or 
through another who will not expose the unknown injurer. <p>

The old law of wages expresses the universal rule in this matter (Lev. 
xix. 13), "The hire of the labourer shall not abide with thee until the 
morning." <p>

<a name="n_2"><a href="#n2">{2}</a></a> Formal cooperation is joining in the bad intention; material 
cooperation is affording to another opportunity for sin, while your 
action is not conjoined to his in will and intention. Material  
cooperation only may be given provided that (a) your act is good, or, 
at least, indifferent (b) your motive is good (c) the bad effect is  
compensated by immediate good (see note on scandal, page 260). But 
consider also (d) whether you cannot hinder another's sin, or are not 
bound in charity to do so; (e) how great the sin is; (f) the probable 
effect of your refusal upon the sinner (g) how near to the sin your 
cooperation will be; (h) what right you have to do what is in 
question; (i) how far the sin does injury to others; (k) is there 
serious loss to yourself in refusal? <p>

(Qu. 1. Communicating those privately known to be unworthy? 2. Working 
a distillery or other property frequently abused? 3. Liquor sellers? 4. 
Church lotteries? 5. Paying part of your rightful claim on government 
to a committee on claims in order to secure the rest? 6. A clerk of a 
corporation is bidden to violate a law of the nation which is 
habitually violated by other corporations also, and he is bidden to 
withhold endamaging documents from the inspection of the court? 7. 
Paying a legislator in order to secure the passage of a necessary bill?) <p>

In general, observe that some things minister directly to sin in these 
intentional cooperation may be "partaking of other men's sins." But 
other things may not be directly sinful which are often abused. Herein, 
when the cooperation does not violate the law of justice as laid down 
in the text, it may or may not violate the law of charity. (Duct. 
Dubitant., IV. i. Rule 11). <p>

And civil law certainly has the right to interfere and forbid what, 
otherwise lawful, is frequently abused. <p>

In common law criminal cooperation is participation in some way in the 
felonious design. But if counsel is given for one crime, and another, 
different in object and not merely in circumstances, is  committed, the 
counsellor is not responsible. An accessory after the fact is one who 
conceals the offender or aids him to escape. <p>

(Qu.: Suppose that he is a near relative? Common law makes no exception 
of such a case; does moral law?) <p>

Compounding of felony is punishable by common law, and is an insult to 
justice; but assaults and other similar misdemeanours (<i>e.g.</i>, 
trespass) may be compounded (Blackst.,iv. 13, 38, 188). <p>

Conspiracy, by common law (modified in the United States), is an 
agreement to commit an act injurious to health, morals, trade,  
commerce, or law. But if there be no felony, there must be some overt 
act to constitute it a crime. <p>
