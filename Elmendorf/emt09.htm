<h3>CHAPTER II.  HOPE AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Hope.</h4><p>

<i>Why is hope a virtue?</i><p>

Virtue has already been defined in Aristotle's words, as "that which 
makes him who has it good, and renders his work good" (Eth. Nic., ii. 
5). Therefore, wherever any good act of man is found, some human virtue 
corresponds thereto. But in all things which are subject to rule and 
measure, the good depends on their attaining that proper rule; as we 
call a coat good which neither exceeds nor falls short of the due 
measure. But we have seen (see page 80) that there is a two-fold 
measure of human acts, one proximate and homogeneous with those acts, 
<i>sc.</i>, reason; another, supreme and transcendent, <i>sc.</i>, God. 
And on this account every human act which attains to reason or to God 
is a good act. But the act of hope, of which we are now speaking, 
attains to God. For the object of the natural passion of hope is future 
good, difficult of attainment, yet possible to be had. Now, anything is 
possible for us either through our own selves or through others. But in 
so far as we hope for anything as possible to us through Divine aid, 
our hope attains to God, on whose aid it rests. And so it is plain that 
such hope is a virtue, since it makes a man's act good, attaining to 
its due rule and measure. (Define this theological virtue, then, as "a 
habit of soul, Divinely infused, through which with sure confidence we 
expect to obtain the spiritual good of eternal life by Divine aid.") 
This hope is not the natural passion (though grounded in that), but a 
spiritual habit, purely the gift of grace. 
<!--
176 HOPE AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. XVII. 2, 5.  
--><A NAME="p176"></a><p>

<i>What is the proper object of hope?</i><p>

The apostle answers when he says (Heb. vi. 19) that hope "enters into 
that which is within the Veil." It attains to God, in resting on His 
aid for the obtaining of the hoped-for good. Now the effect must be 
proportioned to its cause. And therefore the good which properly and 
principally we ought to hope from God, is infinite good, since that is 
proportioned to the power of Him who aids us. But this good is eternal 
life, which consists in the fruition of God Himself. For not less is to 
be hoped from Him than He Himself is, since His goodness by which He 
communicates blessing to His creatures is not less than His infinite
essence. Therefore, the proper and principal object of hope is eternal 
beatitude. <p>

(1) But how can man hope for what exceeds the desire of his soul? (1 
Cor. ii. 9). I answer that man at present cannot perfectly know what 
beatitude is; but he can apprehend it under the general notion of 
perfect good, and so he can hope for it; and thus his hope "enters into 
that which is within the veil." <p>

(2) But prayer interprets hope, and we can lawfully pray for the goods 
of this present life, both spiritual and temporal goods, and for 
deliverance from evils, which will not exist in the eternal beatitude. 
But whatever other good things we ask from God, we are bound to ask 
with reference to eternal beatitude. And so, besides its principal 
object, hope may have objects derived from this and dependent on it. In 
a similar manner we regarded the virtue of faith. <p>

Through love one may hope and desire for another as for himself.  <p>

<i>Why is hope a theological virtue?</i><p>

It is a virtue from its attaining the supreme rule of human actions, 
which it attains both as that rule is its primal efficient cause, on 
whose aid it rests; and as that rule is its ultimate final cause, and 
it expects beatitude in 
<!--
Qu. xvii. 6, 7, 8.] HOPE. 177 
--><A NAME="p177"></a>
 the fruition of that end. Hope's object, then, as virtue, is chiefly 
God. And in this consists the notion of theological virtue, that it has 
God for its object. (See page 69.) Hope, therefore, is a theological 
virtue. <p>

If other good things are expected by it, this is in relation to God as 
their ultimate end, or from God as their efficient cause. <p>

There are moral virtues also which are based on expectation, on patient 
waiting, but hope's distinguishing characteristic is its expectation of 
Divine aid.  <p>

<i>God is the object of all the theological virtues, but in different 
manner.</i><p>

Love makes man cleave to God for His own sake; hope, as the source of 
eternal beatitude for us; faith, as the source of truth. In the creed 
of faith you say: "I look for the life of the world to come," wherein 
the act of faith is manifested by the act of hope.  <p>

<i>If we speak of the order of theological virtues, we must distinguish 
between the natural order of generation in which the imperfect precedes 
the perfect, and the (rational) order of perfection.</i> <p>

In the first way faith precedes hope, and hope precedes charity. It is 
necessary, if one hope for anything, that it be presented to him as 
possible of attainment. Now the objects of hope are eternal beatitude 
and Divine aid. And each of these is proposed to us by faith, which 
makes known that we can reach eternal life, and that Divine aid for 
this has been prepared on our behalf. "He that comes to God must 
believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that seek after 
Him" (Heb. xi. 6). Hope also brings in charity, inasmuch as one who 
hopes to be rewarded by God is induced to love Him and keep His 
commandments. <p>

But, in the order of perfection, love is prior. Perfect love, which 
cleaves to God for His own sake, renders hope 
<!--
178 HOPE AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. XX. 1. 
--><A NAME="p178"></a>
 more perfect, for we hope most from those who are our friends. This is 
<i>"spes fermata,"</i> in which one hopes from God because He loves and 
is loved. <p>

The act of hope belongs to the "appetitive" soul, because it is a 
seeking after the good; but it does not pertain to the sense-appetite, 
because the object is not sensible good, but Divine good.  <p>

Along with this virtue maybe considered the spiritual gift of <i>godly 
fear</i> (qu. xix.). We may fear that which is evil, or that from which 
the evil proceeds. In the first way, God cannot be feared. In the 
second way He can. This evil proceeding from God, evil <i>secundum 
quid</i>, though good simply, is the evil of punishment, <i>"malum 
paenae,"</i> which is the ground of servile fear, in which one turns to 
God through fear of His judgments. Or, with filial fear one may dread 
separation from God through his own fault, <i>"malum culpae,"</i> or, 
again, there may be that worldly fear which the Lord prohibited as evil 
(S. Matt. x. 28), in which, through love of the world and dread of 
worldly loss, one departs from the Service of God. It is filial fear 
which is the gift of the Holy Spirit, like the other spiritual gifts, a 
certain habitual perfection of the soul, by which it is made prompt to 
follow the guidance of the Holy Ghost, just as moral virtues render the 
passions prompt to follow reason.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Vices opposed to hope: despair and presumption.</h4><p>

<i>Is despair a sin?</i><p>

It is a noteworthy remark of Aristotle's (Nic. Eth., vi. 2), that 
seeking and aversion in the will correspond to affirmation and negation 
in the intellect. And good and evil in the latter correspond with the 
true and the false in the former. And, therefore, every motion of 
desire which is conformed to the truth of the reason is in itself good, 
and 
<!--
Qu. xx. 2.] DESPAIR. 179 
--><A NAME="p179"></a>
 every motion of desire which follows the false is in itself evil and 
sin. But the true thought of the mind concerning God is that from Him 
come our salvation and pardon for sinners (Ezek. xviii. 23). And the 
false opinion is that He denies pardon to the penitent, or that He does 
not turn sinners to Himself by justifying grace. And as hope which is 
conformed to correct estimation of God is laudable and virtuous, so the 
opposite, which is despair based on a false estimation of God, is 
vicious and a sin. <p>

Every mortal sin whatsoever is some kind of aversion from the infinite 
Good; but the sins which are opposed to the theological virtues 
consist, primarily and chiefly, in this aversion, as hatred of God, 
despair and infidelity, because the theological virtues have God for 
their direct object and he that deserts God necessarily turns himself 
to some changeable good. But other sins consist principally in the 
turning to such good, and, consequently, in aversion from God. For the 
sensualist does not intend to depart from God, but to enjoy his 
pleasure; from which follows the aversion from God. <p>

Fear of God is good; yet indirectly evil fruit may proceed from a good 
root, when one uses the good in a bad way, taking occasion for despair 
from his servile fear.  <p>

<i>Does despair necessarily imply infidelity?</i><p>

The latter belongs to reason, the former to the will. But reason 
considers universals, while the will is moved to particular things. 
Now, one can have a correct estimation of universal principles, while 
his estimation of particulars is corrupt. His general judgment 
necessarily proceeds to the desire of some particular thing through the 
medium of some particular judgment; and hence it is that one may have a 
right faith in general, while his will fails in the particular thing, 
his estimation of that particular thing being corrupted by habit or by 
passion. One may rightly believe in the forgiveness of sins in Holy 
Church, yet give up to 
<!--
180 HOPE AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. XX. 8, 4.
--><A NAME="p180"></a>
 despair; sc., that in his present state there is no hope of pardon for 
him in particular.  <p>

<i>According to their specific character the gravest sins are those 
which are opposed to the theological virtues.</i> <p>

These have God for their object; those are direct aversion from God. 
Such sins are infidelity, hatred of God, and despair. In themselves the 
two former are even graver than the last. For infidelity comes from 
rejecting the veracity of God; hatred, from a will opposed to the 
Divine goodness; despair, from the want of hope that one will be a 
sharer in that goodness. The two former, therefore, are directly 
against God as He is in Himself; the last, as His goodness is 
participated by us. But, on our side, despair is more dangerous, 
because by hope we are recalled from evils, and led to seek for good; 
but hope being taken away, men rush into unbridled vices and are held 
back from efforts for good.  <p>

<i>Causes of the mortal sin of despair.</i><p>

We have seen (page 175) that the object of hope is good difficult of 
attainment, but possible to be obtained through one's own efforts or by 
another's aid. Hope of beatitude, then, may fail in either of two ways: 
either that felicity is not regarded as such a good, or it is deemed 
unattainable. If our affections are corrupted by the love of sensual 
pleasures, spiritual good things are distasteful, and are not hoped for 
as difficult goods. So lust (<i>luxuria</i>) produces despair. <p>

But, on the other hand, spiritual sloth (<i>"acedia"</i>) casts down 
the soul so that the difficult good is viewed as unattainable. So this 
capital sin produces despair.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> 
<!--
Qu. XXI. 1.] PRESUMPTION. 181  
--><A NAME="p181"></a><p>

<i>Presumption: what is its object?</i><p>

Presumption implies unwarranted, immoderate hope. Now, hope is of what 
is possible, and that possibility refers either to one's own powers, or 
to the Divine aid. There are, then, two kinds of presumption: one, by 
which any one is seeking some good as possible for himself, though it 
exceed his powers; another, by which any one is seeking some good as 
possible through the power and mercy of God, when it is not possible -- 
<i>e.g.</i>, he hopes to obtain pardon without repentance, or glory 
without deserving it. But this kind of presumption is a species of sin 
against the Holy Ghost, since by it is taken away or despised the aid 
of the Holy Ghost by which man is recalled from sin. <p>

(1) Does there seem to be greater presumption in trusting to one's own 
powers than in trusting to Divine power? But the gravest sin is sin 
against God. Hence, the presumption which inordinately rests on God is 
graver sin than that which trusts to one's own power. For it is 
derogating from God when one expects to obtain through His aid what it 
is unworthy of God to bestow. He sins more gravely who diminishes the 
holiness of God than he who exalts his own powers. <p>

(2) Is it objected that other sins arise from sin against the Holy 
Ghost, and that self-confidence, which is rooted in self-love, is the 
source of many sins rather than presumption respecting God's mercy? And 
so, that it is the first kind of presumption which is sin against the 
Holy Ghost. <p>

But inordinate presumption respecting God includes self-love by which 
one inordinately desires his own good. For what we greatly desire we 
deem easy of attainment through others' aid, even when that is not 
possible. <p>

(3) Presumption in Divine mercy is true aversion from  
<!--
182 HOPE AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. XXI. 2, 4. 
--><A NAME="p182"></a>
 God, because it attributes to God what is unworthy of His holy nature. <p>

Briefly, as from despair one despises the Divine mercy on which hope 
rests, so from presumption one despises the Divine justice which 
punishes sinners. But both mercy and justice are in God. Therefore, as 
despair is inordinate aversion from God, so presumption is inordinate 
turning to Him (which is true aversion from some part of the infinite 
good. See (3) above).  <p>

<i>Is presumption a sin?</i><p>

What was said with respect to sin is once more to be repeated; so., 
that every act of will which conforms to falsehood in the intellect is 
in itself evil and a sin (page 179). But presumption is such an act. 
For as it is false that God spares not the penitent, or that He does 
not turn sinners to repentance, so it is false that He grants pardon to 
those who persevere in sin, and that He glorifies those who cease from 
good works. On which false estimation presumption is based. Therefore 
it is a sin, less in its kind, indeed, than despair is, since it is 
God's "property always to have mercy" and "to forgive sins " rather 
than to punish them, because of His infinite goodness; for that belongs 
to His nature, but this to His justice according to our sins. <p>

Note that this presumption is not excess of hope, hoping too much of 
God; for it is hoping to obtain from God what is unworthy of His 
holiness, which is even hoping less from Him, because it is detraction 
from Him.  <p>

<i>The source of presumption is the capital sin of pride or 
vainglory.</i> <p>

Self-presumption, inordinate trust in one's own powers, is manifestly 
the child of vainglory. And inordinate trust in the power or mercy of 
God comes from pride, when one thinks himself of so much consequence 
that God will not punish his sins, or exclude him from glory. 
<!--
Qu. XXII.] PRECEPTS OF HOPE. 183  
--><A NAME="p183"></a><p>

<i>Precepts of hope and fear.</i><p>

Of the precepts which are found in the Holy Scriptures some belong to 
the substance of Divine law, and some are preambles to that law. The 
latter are presupposed, because, if they did not exist, there would be 
no place found for law (none would be subject to that law for whom it 
should be promulged). Of this nature are precepts of faith and hope, 
because by the act of faith the mind of man is led to recognize the 
authority of the author of the law, and by hope of reward man is led to 
obedience. But those precepts are of the substance of the law itself, 
which are given to one already subject to the law, and ready to obey 
it; they pertain to rectitude of life. But precepts of hope and faith 
were not set forth as precepts, because, if man did not already believe 
and hope, the law would be set forth in vain. (Note that faith in God 
being presupposed, through which the human mind is submitted to God, 
commandments can be given concerning other things which are to be 
believed, as is apparent in the New Law of the Gospel. See qu. xvi., 
omitted above.) <p>

But as the precept of faith was prefixed to the proclamation of the law 
-- <i>sc.</i>, "I am the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land 
of Egypt" (Ex. xx. 2); and "Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one 
Lord" (Deut. vi. 4) -- so also the precept of hope in the first giving 
of the law was in the form of promises attached to the second and the 
fifth commandments. For he that promises rewards to the obedient, by 
that very thing incites them to hope. <p>

But when the law is once imposed, men are urged to observe its 
preambles, as in Ps. lxii. 8 "O put your trust in Him alway, ye people; 
pour out your hearts before Him, for God is our hope." <p>

(1) Nature sufficiently inclines to good proportioned to human nature, 
but man must be inclined to hope for supernatural good both by promises 
and by admonitions or precepts. And yet even for that to which natural 
reason tends, 
<!--
184 HOPE AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. XXII. 2.
--><A NAME="p184"></a>
precepts of Divine law are necessary for the sake of greater firmness 
in them, and because reason is apt to be clouded by sinful 
concupiscences. <p> 

(2) Prohibition of opposite sins must of course be understood whenever 
the law in any manner incites to hope or faith.  <p>

<i>The same things may be said of fear.</i><p>

But we must remember the distinction between servile fear, the fear of 
penalties, and filial fear which springs from love. The first giving of 
the law did not command fear, but it threatened penalties on the 
violators of law. (See the Second Commandment.) But filial fear and 
love are preambles to the acts which the law commands. So it was said 
(Deut. x. 12), "And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of 
Thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, to walk in all His ways, and to 
love Him?" etc. These are the principles common to the whole law. And 
this injunction to fear suffices to exclude presumption (its opposite 
vice). <p>

<hr><p>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a></a> This mortal sin of despair caused by Just or spiritual sloth should 
be distinguished from what may outwardly resemble it: (a) the  
scrupulous conscience which is always finding difficulties in the way 
of salvation that east down the mind, and tend to obscure its hope; (b) 
what is not infrequent in our age, incipient <i>"melancholia"</i> 
taking a religious form, and perplexing the family and the priest, who 
have not detected the approach of insanity. <p>
