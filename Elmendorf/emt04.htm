<h3>CHAPTER IV.  ON GOOD AND EVIL IN THE PASSIONS OF THE SOUL.</h3><p>

(A psychological view of the passions of the human soul belongs to our 
subject only so far as it is necessary for a clear understanding of our 
moral relations. For if good and evil have in any way those passions 
for their subject, it is evident that we cannot understand our proper 
theme unless we have first clearly seen what man is in these powers 
which may he corrupted. Knowledge of the corruption implies knowledge 
of that which is corrupted, But our space allows of only a rapid glance 
at that which S. Thomas endeavors to analyze and consider in detail.)  
<h4>&sect. 1. General view.</h4><p>

The word "passion" indicates that the soul is rather acted upon than 
exerting its spontaneous activity, while at the same time it 
undoubtedly reacts upon the external stimulus. But, in feeling, the 
soul is acted upon through the bodily frame which is united with it, 
the body itself, first and chiefly its nerve-centres, undergoing a 
mysterious alteration. Passions are closely connected with desires, for 
these desires are the peculiar reaction of the soul towards that which 
is presented to it through the passions. <p>

And what distinguishes these passions and desires from the higher 
nature of reason and will, is that the former are directly conditioned 
by bodily (nervous) alteration. <p>

The (Aristotelian) division of passions into the concupiscible and the 
irascible is serviceable for our purpose. The object of the former is 
the sensible good (simply such) as pleasurable or painful. But 
sometimes the soul undergoes difficulty or conflict in obtaining some 
such good, or avoiding some such evil. And so the same good or evil, 
with the 
<!--
Qu. XXIV. 1, 2.] GENERAL VIEW. 45 
--><A NAME="p45"></a>
 added quality of special difficulty, is the object of the irascible 
passions. To the former class belong such passions as joy, sorrow, 
love, hate, and the like; to the latter class, courage, fear, hope, 
etc.  <p>

<i>Are moral good and evil found in the passions?</i><p>

We may consider these passions in themselves, or as they are subject to 
the dominion of reason and will. In themselves they are motions of 
irrational appetite. So viewed, there is neither moral good nor moral 
evil in them, for these require reason as their basis. <p>

It is quite otherwise if we view those passions as under the dominion 
of reason and will. For as the motions of the bodily members are good 
or bad, morally speaking, so as they are voluntary, so and much more so 
the motions of the passions, which are nearer to the higher nature than 
the body is. Acts of passions are voluntary either because they are 
commanded by the will, or because they are not prohibited by it. <p>

Here is the common ground of man and brute. Both have these passions. 
But in the brute there is no spiritual reason which can command them. 
Therefore the brute's life is not a moral life. <p>

But in man passions and desires are, in a certain way, rational, 
because it is one human being who possesses the reason and is affected 
by the passions.  <p>

<i>Is every passion of the soul morally bad?</i><p>

The Stoics seem to say that they are so. But they do not distinguish 
between will and desire, between sensibility and reason. Therefore 
every rational exertion of desire they call will, and every act which 
transcends the limits of reason they call passion. So viewed, passions 
are diseases of the soul. But we may understand by passions every 
motion of sense-appetite. So viewed, if governed by reason they are not 
diseases, they are not evil. 
<!--
46 GOOD AND EVIL DW THE PASSIONS. [Qu. XXV. 2.  
--><A NAME="p46"></a><p>

It is true that they incline to sin, so far as they are outside of the 
domain of reason; but, as ordered by it, they are the subject of 
virtue.  <p>

<i>Does passion add to, or diminish from, the goodness or the badness 
of our act?</i><p>

According to the Stoic, every passion diminishes the goodness of our 
act, because that passion is a disease of our reason. But if by 
passions we mean all motions of sense-appetite, we see that the 
government of those passions by reason pertains to the perfection of 
human good. That good is rooted in reason, but it is more perfect the 
wider its power extends. No one doubts that the directing the acts of 
our bodily members by reason pertains to the perfection of moral good. 
And since the sense-appetite, also, can obey reason, the same thing is 
true of that. As, then, it is better that a man both will the good and 
produce the outward act accordingly, so it is better that a man be 
moved to the good not only by his will but also by his affections. So 
the psalm says (lxxxiv. 2), "My heart and my flesh rejoice in the 
living God." Where, if "heart" (according to Hebrew usage) represents 
spiritual reason and will, "flesh" will stand for the affections of 
sense-appetite. <p>

Morally viewed -- <i>sc.</i>, looking at the object of the passion as 
harmonizing with reason or discordant from it -- passions may be good 
or bad in their own nature; <i>e.g.</i>, envy, which is sorrow at 
another's good.  <p>

<i>Which is first in the order of passions?</i><p>

Love, among those of the concupiscible soul. For its object is the 
good, of which evil is only the privation implying the prior good. In 
the order of attainment first comes love, which is complacency in its 
object; next, desire of that good, a motion of the soul towards it; 
and last, joy or pleasure, which is rest in its possession. But if we 
speak of the order of intention, it is the reverse of   
<!--
Qu. XXVI.] ON LOVE. 47 
--><A NAME="p47"></a>
 this. For the pleasure aimed at causes the desire and the love. <p>

Hope is prior among the passions of the irascible soul; for those 
passions are naturally prior whose object is the good. And hope is 
inward motion towards an absent good. This makes it first in order. <p>

The four principal passions are joy, sorrow, hope, and fear. In present 
good, there is joy; in present evil, sorrow; of future gpod, there is 
hope; and of future evil, there is fear.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. On Love.</h4><p>

Love is one species of inclination or appetite for the good. In nature 
we find such an inclination without apprehension of its object. In 
brutes we find it (apparently) accompanied by apprehension of its 
object. We call it instinctive love. But there is another kind of 
seeking for the object of love, which is rational and according to free 
choice. In each there is a principle of motion towards the desired end. 
Sense-love, then, is complacency in the good of sensitive appetite; as 
spiritual love is complacency in the good of reason and will. The sole 
cause of love is the good, because that is the object of love. Evil is 
never loved except it be apprehended as good, because it is a good 
<i>secundum quid</i>. Man is said to love iniquity, inasmuch as by it 
he expects to obtain some good, as pleasure or money. <p>

We speak, indeed, of a love for the beautiful. But this is the good in 
another and special point of view. For the good is what all things 
seek, and rest in when obtained. But to the idea of the beautiful it 
pertains that desire rests in the outward or inward contemplation of 
it. And so the beautiful adds to the notion of the good a certain 
relation to our cognoscitive power. That is simply good which pleases 
desire; but that is beautiful whose apprehension pleases. <p>

Knowledge, at least partial knowledge, is a pre-requisite 
<!--
48 GOOD AND EVIL IN THE PASSIONS. [Qu. XXIX. 4, 5. 
--><A NAME="p48"></a>
 and cause of love. But since cognition pertains to reason, its 
perfection reqaires a completeness of intellectual apprehension which 
is not needed for perfect love. This requires that the thing be loved 
so far as it is apprehended. Consider, in this regard, our love of God.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. Hate.</h4><p>

As in animal or in rational appetite love is a certain agreement of the 
desire with that which is apprehended as harmonizing with self and 
beneficial to self, so to that which is repugnant and injurious to 
well-being is felt the passion of hate. This repugnant and injurious 
thing is evil, and so evil is the object of hate. All hate springs from 
love; for nothing is hated except as it is opposed to that which is 
regarded as good.  <p>

<i>Can one hate himself?</i><p>

Properly speaking, this is impossible. For each thing naturally seeks 
its own good, and can desire nothing for itself except as good. Evil is 
always opposed to the will. But to love any one is to will the good for 
him. Hence, self-love is a necessity of nature. But still, one may be 
said (<i>per accidens</i>) to hate himself, for two reasons: (1) He may 
seek what is, <i>secundum quid</i>, a good for himself, while it is 
simply evil; (2) He may chiefly regard his animal nature, and love 
himself according to his own estimation of himself. But he hates that 
which he most truly is, in willing what is contrary to reason. In both 
ways, he who loves iniquity hates not only his soul, but himself. <p>

Even the suicide apprehends his death as a good thing; viz., the 
cessation of pain or misery.  <p>

<i>Can any one hate the truth?</i><p>

The Good and Being and the True are one in essence, but differ in our 
thought. For the Good adds the idea of  
<!--
Qu. XXX. 8.] CONCUPISCENCE. 49
--><A NAME="p49"></a>
 what is desirable; but not so the Thought of Being or of the True. And, 
therefore, the Good as good cannot be hated, neither universally nor in 
particulars. But Being and the True cannot be hated in their general 
notion, because disagreement is the cause of hate, and the opposite is 
the cause of love. But Being and the True are common to all things. 
But, in particulars, nothing prevents a certain being and a certain 
truth from being hated, inasmuch as it contains the idea of contrariety 
and repugnance. For these are not opposed to the idea of Being and of 
the True, as they are to the idea of the Good. (1) Man may will that 
not to be true which is so; and so he may hate the truth. (2) Truth in 
his cognition may hinder his attaining what be loves, and so it is 
hated. So one may will not to know the verity of the faith in order 
that be may freely sin. Thus we read in the book of Job (xxi. 14), that 
the wicked said unto God, "Depart from us, for we desire not the 
knowledge of Thy ways." (3) Some particular truth may be repugnant and 
be hated, as it exists in the mind of another, as when one wishes to 
continue in his sin, and hates that another know the truth concerning 
that sin.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. Concupiscence.</h4><p>

I mean by concupiscence the desire of pleasure, not in the good of 
reason, which desire belongs to the soul alone, but in the good of 
sense, which belongs to the creature compounded of body and soul. Such 
desire is in sense-appetite. It is a special passion, springing from 
love and tending towards pleasure.  <p>

Some condupiscences are natural; some are not. <p>

In two modes is anything pleasurable and desired. First, as in 
accordance with the animal nature, as food, drink, etc.; desire of 
these is natural concupiscence. In another mode anything is 
pleasurable, according to apprehension of it (<i>i.e.</i>, to the soul 
viewing it). Desire of this 
<!--
50 GOOD AND EVIL IN THE PASSIONS. [Qu. XXXI. 7. 
--><A NAME="p50"></a>
 is not "natural" (in the same sense of the word), and may be called 
cupidity. The natural concupiscences are common to man and brute (since 
they have the same animal nature). But the non-natural are peculiar to 
man, since it is his peculiar gift to consider something as good and 
suited to himself beside what nature requires. <p>

But the same thing may be sought for by natural appetite, and by 
cupidity when it is contemplated by the mind as a good. <p>

Natural concupiscence cannot be actually infinite, for it is only of 
what nature requires, though it may be indefinitely prolonged, since 
corporeal goods fail, and need to be renewed. But the non-natural, 
since it follows reason which has no bounds, is unbounded. He whose 
cupidity is directed to riches, has no limit to his desire. If, indeed, 
riches were the means to another end -- say, the necessities of life
 -- there would be a limit to the desire of them. But if riches are the 
end itself, there can be no limit.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 5. Pleasure.</h4><p>

Pleasure is an emotion or passion of the soul following upon the good 
attained. It is, indeed, a sort of rest of the soul in that good, but 
not an inactive rest. <p>

Pleasure is not always joy. For as there are certain natural 
concupiscences and certain ones non-natural, so there are natural 
pleasures, and others which follow reason. These latter are what we 
call joy. Hence we do not (properly) attribute joy to brutes, but only 
pleasure. We may, indeed, have joy in natural pleasures, but not 
conversely. Pleasure, therefore, is a word of wider extent than joy. <p>

Joy is found in the rational appetite, the will. It is purely in the 
soul; whereas sense-pleasure involves bodily transmutation.  <p>

<i>Can any pleasure he unnatural?</i><p>

What do we mean by natural? In man the word may 
<!--
Qu. XXXII.] PLEASURE. 51
--><A NAME="p51"></a>
 have two meanings. Since reason and understanding are the distinctive 
characteristics of man's nature, we may call natural pleasures those 
which properly belong to man as a rational being. To take pleasure in 
the truth and in the practice of virtue is natural to man. But, in 
another way, nature may mean what is common to man and other animals, 
as opposed to man's peculiar gift of reason. Accordingly, what pertains 
to the preservation of the individual or the species may be said to be 
naturally pleasurable. <p>

But, according to both meanings of the word natural, some pleasures are 
simply unnatural, though, in a sense, connatural. For that which is 
contrary to the nature of man, either as respects reason or as regards 
the preservation of the body (or the species), may become connatural to 
some individual on account of the corruption of his nature. Either body 
or soul (or both) may be so corrupted; and the result will be similar 
in both cases.  <p>

<i>Activity is the antecedent of pleasure.</i><p>

For pleasure requires the attaining of a suitable good, and knowledge 
of its attainment. Both of these are operations of the soul. Therefore 
operation is the antecedent of pleasure. Pleasure is also the result of 
concomitant activity. For there is a transmutation of the soul itself 
in the presence of the pleasurable good; that good increases its 
influence with its continued presence; and, thirdly, there is growing 
desire to know the pleasurable thing more perfectly. <p>

Hope and memory make the past or the future to be present to the mind. 
Therefore they are causes of joy; and most especially hope, because 
there is added to apprehension of the future the possibility of 
obtaining the delectable good. <p>

Even sorrow, in a certain way, may be the cause of pleasure, first, by 
bringing back to mind the lost pleasure, whose very presence in the 
memory has some pleasure connected 
<!--
52 GOOD AND EVIL IN THE PASSIONS. [Qu. XXXIV. 1, 2. 
--><A NAME="p52"></a>
 with it. But far more is sorrow, when it is escaped, the cause of 
pleasure. For the very escape is itself regarded as a great good. And 
of the blessed in heaven it may be said that the greater the danger 
(and sorrow) in the battle, the greater the joy in the triumph. <p>

The actions of others may be the cause of pleasure to ourselves, (1) 
when by them we obtain some good; (2) when through others we get 
higher estimation of our own proper good, by praise and honor; so even 
the flatterer is pleasurable to some; (3) love may lead us to regard 
the good actions of others as if they were our own. <p>

Doing good to others may be the cause of pleasure for various reasons. 
(Other causes of pleasure are here omitted.)  <p>

<i>Is every pleasure evil?</i><p>

Pleasure is the rest of the soul in some good which is loved, and it 
follows some activity of the soul. A pleasure is good when the higher 
or lower desire of the soul rests in that which is accordant with 
reason, and evil when it rests in that which is discordant with reason 
and with God's law. Again, since the concupiscences of good operations 
are good, which desires precede action, much rather are the pleasures 
good which are conjoined to such operations. We conclude, then, that 
the pleasures of good action are good; the pleasures of bad action, 
evil. <p>

It is true that pleasures which corrupt prudence and impede the use of 
reason are bad in general; but pleasures from the exercise of reason 
do nothing of this kind (but rather exalt the exercise of reason 
itself). <p>

Temperance (and Sobriety) do not consist in fleeing from all pleasures, 
but from the immoderate ones, and those not consonant with reason.  <p>

<i>Is every pleasure good?</i><p>

As the Stoic makes every pleasure evil, so the Epicurean 
<!--
Qu. XXXV.] PAIN AND SORUOW. 53
--><A NAME="p53"></a>
 considers pleasure, as such, to be a good, and every pleasure good. 
But they should distinguish between what is simply good and that which 
is good, relatively, to this man or that. What is not in itself a good 
may be so, relatively, to the individual for two reasons: (1) His 
unnatural state makes that to suit his condition which otherwise would 
be unsuited, unnatural; (2) his false estimation of good may cause 
him to find pleasurable rest in that which is not truly good. (Such 
pleasure is evil, like its source.) <p>

The highest pleasure in beatitude is the highest of human good things.  <p>

<i>Is pleasure the measure and rule by which we judge moral good and 
evil?</i> <p>

These are principally found in the will. But whether the will is good 
or bad is known from its end. And that is esteemed as the end in which 
the will rests. But this rest is pleasure. And so the pleasure which a 
man finds in this or that is the measure by which the good or the bad 
man is judged to he what he is. The virtuous man is he who delights in 
virtuous operation; the bad man is he who finds his pleasure in evil 
actions. <p>

But the pleasures of sense-appetite are not the measure of moral good 
and evil (since the will is not directly concerned therein). <p>

Action is not perfectly good, unless there be pleasure in the good; for 
since pleasure perfects operation as an end of it, not indeed as the 
end for which a thing is done, but as a supervening good; and since, 
also, the agent who finds pleasure in action acts more energetically in 
consequence thereof; and since the goodness of a thing depends upon its 
end, in a certain way the goodness of pleasure is a cause of goodness 
in the action.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 6. Pain and sorrow.</h4><p>

Pain is a passion of the (sensitive) soul, following upon 
<!--
54 GOOD AND EVIL IN THE PASSIONS. [Qu. XXXIX. 2. 
--><A NAME="p54"></a>
 what injures the body, when that evil is perceived. Sorrow is a 
species of inward pain which is due, not to sense-apprehension, but 
to the inward apprehension of reason or imagination. The outward sense 
perceives only the present condition of the body; but the inward 
cognition embraces also the past and the future; therefore sorrow has 
wider extent than pain. <p>

Since sorrow in the soul is a motion away from its object, its object 
is rather the evil conjoined to the soul than the lost good. But love 
of that good is the cause of that sorrow for its loss. But the loss 
itself is apprehended as an evil.  <p>

<i>Is all sorrow evil?</i><p>

In itself it is simply an evil, for the very fact that man's desire is 
oppressed by present evil, is itself an evil. But, in another way, a 
thing is called good or evil when we assume a certain hypothesis. <p>

Thus shame is said to be good after a base fault. If we suppose, then, 
some due occasion for sorrow, it pertains to goodness that one be 
saddened by a present evil. If it were not so, the reason would be 
either that the evil was not felt, or that it was not regarded as evil. 
And both of these are manifestly evil. "It is still a good that we 
grieve for lost good; for unless some good remained in nature, in 
penalty, there would be no pain for lost good." (S. Aug., Gen. ad lit., 
viii. 14.)  <p>

<i>Can sorrow be a moral good?</i><p>

The Lord said (S. Matt. v. 5), "Blessed are they that mourn, for they 
shall be comforted," which word of His answers our question. But we may 
examine the reasons for the affirmative answer. Sorrow is, as we have 
seen, a good from its containing a knowledge of evil and an aversion to 
it. So bodily pain attests the goodness of the nature which feels the 
bodily evil, and shuns what as injurious to the body. But in the inward 
sorrow there is 
<!--
Qu. XLVI. 2.] ANGER. 55 
--><A NAME="p55"></a>
 sometimes right judgment of reason, and an abhorrence of evil by a 
well-constituted will. But all moral good comes from this rectitude of 
mind and will. Therefore sorrow may be a moral good. <p>

It may be said that we feel sorrow concerning those things which happen 
against our will; but not to will whatever God sends is to have a will 
opposed to His Divine ordering; and rectitude of will requires a 
conformity of our will to the Divine will. But I answer that some 
things -- viz., sins -- happen contrary to God's will. And a will 
repugnant to sin is not discordant from the will of God. Penal evils 
happen indeed with God's consent. But rectitude of will does not 
require that man will those things considered in themselves, but that 
he do not oppose in his soul the order of Divine justice.  No pain or 
sorrow is man's greatest evil.  <p>

For every pain or sorrow is either concerning what is truly evil, or 
concerning some apparent evil which is truly good. But pain or sorrow 
from the first is not the greatest evil, for there is another worse, 
which is either not judging that to be evil which truly is so, or even 
not avoiding it. But pain or sorrow from the second is not the greatest 
evil, for it would be altogether worse to be so alienated from the real 
good. <p>

There is always some mixture of good in pain or sorrow; <i>sc.</i>, a 
will repugnant to evil. <p>

Passing by most of the passions of the irascible soul, we will consider 
lastly,  <p>

<h4>&sect; 7. Anger.</h4><p>

Anger is a passion of the irascible sensitive nature, compounded, as it 
were, of two opposite passions. <p>

For whoever is angry at another seeks for vengeance on him. And so the 
soul's motion in anger tends towards two things; <i>sc.</i>, first, to 
the vengeance which he seeks and hopes 
<!--
56 GOOD AND EV[L IN THE PASSIONS. [Qu. XLVI. 6, 7.  
--><A NAME="p56"></a>
for as a good, and, secondly, anger is directed towards him from whom 
vengeance is sought, as towards an injurious and offensive object. <p>

Love and hate regard one object only, the good and the evil in each 
case. But anger regards one object as good -- <i>sc.</i>, the 
vengeance; another as evil -- <i>sc.</i>, the injurious man, on whom 
vengeance is sought for.  <p>

Hate, therefore, is much graver than anger; for he that hates seeks his 
enemy's evil as evil, but the angry man seeks evil for the one at whom 
he is angry not as evil but as good, so far as he judges that evil to 
be just -- <i>i.e.</i>, vengeance. And herein the virtue of justice may 
be exercised, if the anger be subjected to reason. (We leave out of 
view the Christian grace of charity.) But anger is deficient in this 
only, that it does not obey the command of reason in taking vengeance. <p>

Anger may be more intense than hate; but as regards the thing desired, 
anger may have more of mercy in it. For hate is satisfied with no 
measure of evil. For those things which are sought on their own 
account, are sought without measure. So the avaricious seek riches 
without measure. But anger seeks the evil under the idea that it is 
just. Accordingly, when the evil exceeds due measure, then the angry 
man may have pity. <p>

Vengeance seeks for penalty of wrong-doing. But penalty implies 
something contrary to the will, afflictive, and produced for some 
fault. And. therefore the angry man seeks that the injurer may 
perceive, and feel, and know, that that penalty is come upon him in 
consequence of the injury which he has done. But he that hates another 
cares for none of these things, because he seeks the evil of his enemy 
as evil. This is far worse. <p>

The foregoing considerations will make it plain that anger can only 
come in where justice and injustice are concerned. 
<!--
Qu. XLVII. 2.] ANGER. 57  
--><A NAME="p57"></a><p>

<i>All causes of anger are reducible to low esteem or contempt of the 
injured man.</i><p>

Aristotle (Rhet. ii. 2) very properly distinguishes three kinds of low 
esteem; viz., contempt, hindrance to executing our will, and contumely. 
This low esteem produces anger, since vengeance is sought on account of 
that which seems to be unjustly done. <p>

But injury is done in three ways: through ignorance, through passion, 
through deliberate choice of it. And the latter, most of all, produces 
anger, because the injurer seems to be sinning through contempt of the 
injured. <p>

Again, low esteem is opposed to the proper excellence of man. But, out 
of all our goods, we seek this most of all. And therefore whoever does 
us injury, derogating from our excellency, seems to be acting through 
low esteem of us.
