<h3>CHAPTER XI.  HOLY MATRIMONY.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. The law of nature.</h4><p>

Matrimony may be defined as the permanent union of one man and one 
woman, legitimately made, for the generation and education of children, 
and for mutual service in the family life. Such a union is a law of 
nature; not that there is any physical force bringing it about, but 
because man is naturally inclined to it, and, by his own free will, his 
uncorrupted nature will lead him to such a union. The family is prior 
in time to the state, and even more necessary for the continuance and 
well-being of society and the individual. If man is by nature a "social 
animal," still more is he by nature a member of a family (Nic. Eth. 
viii. 12). The family is essential to the well-being of man; for, 
first, the man and the woman are mutually dependent upon one another 
for bodily and spiritual service, as well as for the exercise of 
natural affections; and, next, children must not only be brought into 
existence for the continuance of the human race, but they must be 
supported, educated, and assisted in the early part of their life 
through many years they need to be counselled and guided even when they 
begin to be independent of their parents; and all this requires a 
determined parentage, such as is wholly inconsistent with that 
promiscuous concubinage which characterizes many lower species of 
animals. <p>

Anthropologists may find perversions of this law of nature among some 
barbarous tribes; hut this fact constitutes no argument against the 
existence of the law, since science cannot well close its eyes to the 
actual corruption and deg<!--
THE LAW OF NATURE. 621 
 --><A NAME="p621"></a>radation of no small portion of the human race. To assert that all 
which actually exists among men is natural, is a patent absurdity which 
needs no refutation by Moral Theology. <p>

Because matrimony is a law of nature, it does not follow that all are 
required to marry when they reach suitable age. What is necessary for 
the perfection of the individual is binding on all. But that which is 
required by society in general is naturally distributed, one doing 
this, and another that. So it may be true, and it is true, that some 
may serve the community in other ways than by marrying, finding 
elsewhere the "vocation" to which God has called them.  <p>

<i>A life-long contract</i>. Other contracts between man and man may be 
for a limited time, but the natural aims and results of this contract 
of matrimony distinguish it and make it life-long. <p>

<i>Concubinage</i>, or the union of man and woman outside of matrimony 
and for a limited time, is contrary to the law of nature, and is 
therefore <i>per se</i> one of those deadly sins which exclude from the 
kingdom of God. It voluntarily fails of those ends which the God of 
nature intends. Its aim may be merely sensuous gratification, or it may 
be evading the responsibilities which follow the production of 
children, whose welfare requires a life-long care. Either way, or in 
both ways, one of nature's primary laws is violated. And this is <i>per 
se</i> mortal sin; because the bonds of charity between man and man are 
broken, and equally so those between man and God, whose primary law is 
violated. <p>

<i>A fortiori</i>, promiscuous fornication is violation of nature's 
law, and mortal sin (1 Cor. vi. 9). <p>

The Catholic Church found the civilized world polluted far and wide by 
every conceivable violation of the law of nature; but she renewed the 
law of nature as part of her discipline, and grace to obey it was 
given. <p>

But matrimony is not subject only to the law of nature. 
<!--
622 HOLY MATRIMONY. 
--><A NAME="p622"></a>
 Since this permanent union of the man and woman must be voluntarily 
entered upon, it involves a contract of which society must take 
cognizance, and the family thus formed is one of the units which 
constitute the state, and becomes subject to its just laws, both in the 
creation of the contract and in the further ordering of the 
partnership. And, finally, marriage, as a sacrament of the Christian 
Church, becomes <i>Holy</i> Matrimony, and the definition given above 
needs to be completed thus: "Matrimony is a permanent union," etc., 
having power of conferring on the parties to it sanctifying grace for 
due fulfilment of its objects. <p>

Thus, Holy Matrimony is, at the same time, a contract of which civil 
law and morals take cognizance, and a sacrament out of which spring 
special obligations. <p>

As a contract, it is a free and voluntary agreement between two parties 
entering into life-long partnership, giving one another nuptial rights, 
mutually promising to fulfil all those duties, and receiving all those 
rights, which are essential to the existence of a family. See the 
betrothal in the marriage service. <p>

As a sacrament, if duly received, it confers grace for the 
sanctification of this union, for faithful execution of the promises 
made, and specially for its great object -- the holy education of 
children as the children of God (Tert., ad Uxor. ii. 8; 5. Ignat., ad 
Polyc. ii.).  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. The sacrament of Holy Matrimony.</h4><p>

The word sacrament is, of course, now used in its wider sense of (1) 
"an outward and visible sign (2) of an inward and spiritual grace given 
unto us, ordained by Christ as (3) a means whereby we receive the same, 
and a pledge to assure us thereof." But if we attempt to follow the 
medi~val theologians in their scholastic distinction of matter and 
form, we may find them not at one among themselves, and involve 
ourselves in needless confusion. <p>

It is sufficient to observe that mutual consent, expressed 
<!--
623 THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY MATRIMONY.
--><A NAME="p623"></a>
 by words or other outward signs, is the efficient cause of the 
contract, and the outward part of the sacrament. Each of the two 
parties gives and receives rights in relation to the other (1 Cor. vii. 
4). This is not a promise concerning the future; such a promise is an 
espousal or betrothal. The contract of marriage is <i>de praesenti</i>; 
its words are "I [now] take thee to my wedded wife." The spiritual 
grace sanctifies the contract, and gives the needful means that the 
persons concerned "may surely perform and keep the vow and covenant 
betwixt them made." <p>

This sacrament makes the marriage indissoluble except by death. What 
God has joined man cannot put asunder. But as a contract, although it 
be for life, the state may have the same control over marriage as over 
other contracts.  <p>

The subject of this sacrament is any baptized person having no 
impediment. Baptism is the door to the Christian life, and those who 
have not entered by that door, though capable of making the marriage 
contract with its accompanying obligations, are not capable of making a 
Christian marriage. Denying this principle of Moral Theology is denying 
the existence of anything distinctive in Christian marriage. <p>

Hence, it follows that if the sacrament confer grace, or create any 
added obligations over and above those of the civil contract of 
marriage, that grace and those obligations are absent from the union of 
a Christian with an unbaptized person, or of two unbaptized persons. 
Such a marriage, under the requisite conditions, is altogether valid as 
a contract; but it seems to be eminently improper for a priest to give 
the nuptial benediction which is intended for those who have united 
themselves in Holy Matrimony. <p>

The marriage of one of the faithful with one who belongs to some 
heretical sect, stands on a different footing. For, as such a person 
has been introduced into the Christian fold by holy Baptism duly 
administered, the same person 
<!--
624 HOLY MATRIMONY. 
--><A NAME="p624"></a>
 is capable of receiving a valid sacrament in Holy Matrimony; and we 
may trust that the inward grace is not absent from one who devoutly 
asks for it. <p>

But the obligations of the Church to the offspring of such a marriage 
are part of her law received from God (1 Cor. vii. 14). hence, on 
account of the practical difficulties in the way of fulfilling those 
duties, the Church is bound to discourage such marriages between the 
faithful and those who are, outwardly at least, separated from the fold 
(2 Cor. vi. 14). <p>

Since Holy Matrimony is a "sacrament of the living," one who receives 
the grace must have no unrepented sin burdening his conscience.  <p>

Who is the minister of this sacrament? We can only reply, the parties 
to the contract themselves. For, as a contract, whether publicly or 
privately made, it is binding, and need not be repeated. Suppose, then, 
that one or both of the two parties, at the time of making the 
contract, were outside of Christ's Church if converted, they will not 
be remarried; their baptism gives them a claim to the nuptial 
benediction; but their already valid contract now takes the character, 
obligations, and grace of such a marriage as they would have celebrated 
at first had they been wedded in God's Church.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

Suppose, again, that in ignorance or heedlessness two baptized persons 
-- <i>e.g.</i>, a runaway couple -- have gone to a justice of the peace 
for a civil cermony, or, in some State of the Union where such a form 
is valid, have taken one another for man and wife, in the presence of 
two or three witnesses. The contract will be valid, we suppose; then 
the union is that of Holy Matrimony, and cannot be repeated with the 
Church's service, for the parties are already married.  
<!--
THE CONTRACT. 625 
--><A NAME="p625"></a>
 The nature of the contract, and ils social relations, require that it 
be in the presence of witnesses. Marriage, accordingly, in the presence 
of a Protestant minister or of a justice of the peace is valid, confers 
the rights, creates the duties, and cannot be repeated. <p>

What the Church adds in her marriage service is the benediction of the 
priest (the parish priest of one or other of the two parties. No other 
without license can lawfully give it. Canons of American Church, title 
i., can. 12; Canons of 1603, No. 62). <p>

This benediction may follow, or it may precede, the civil recognition 
of the marriage contract. <p>

Note that a deacon has received no such power to bless in God's name.  <p>

<i>Conditions of honourable and holy Matrimony</i>. There are three 
goods which distinguish Holy Matrimony, and separate it from 
fornication and concubinage: (1) The sacrament which makes it 
honourable, holy, and indissoluble by any earthly power in state or 
church; (2) fidelity to a promise made to "keep only unto" one so long 
as life lasts; (3) children as the gift of God, to be nurtured for His 
service. These three, of which the first is chief, separate the 
spiritual union of Christians in Holy Matrimony from the fleshly union 
of beasts and fornicators. The law of conjugal debt is laid down in 
God's word, 1 Cor. vii. 3-5. And note the sin of refusing obedience 
to it, in order to avoid the burden of offspring.  <p>

<a name="sect3"></a>
<h4>&sect; 3. The contract.</h4><p>

Betrothal is a true, deliberate, mutual promise, duly expressed, that 
this contract will, within a reasonable period, be made. Such promise 
may be either public (of which the first part of the Anglican marriage 
service retains the form) or private; but it is subject at the time 
only to the conditions requisite for lawful matrimony. Such espousals, 
com<!--
626 HOLY MATRIMONY. 
 --><A NAME="p626"></a>monly treated so lightly, are binding both in law and in morals. 
Law, therefore, not only punishes for pecuniary loss, but gives 
exemplary damages if such promise be violated. <p>

Careless promises, however, respecting the future may possibly be no 
true betrothal; although civil law may discourage such by giving 
damages for "breach of promise." <p>

The contract must be fulfilled within reasonable time; that is implied 
in the act of betrothal.  <p>

<i>How is such an "engagement" dissolved?</i> (1) Long-continued 
absence of either one of the two parties certainly releases the other, 
if it be so desired, for the contract was not made subject to the 
serious injury of either of them. (2) Grave and permanent disease 
releases, for a serious change of circumstances may annul any contract 
<i>de futuro, in foro conscientiae</i>. (3) Since the parties promise 
to give nuptial rights to one another, unchaste conduct in either will 
release the innocent from the promise made. (4) The contract de futuro 
may be dissolved by mutual consent -- <i>e.g.</i>, when the parties 
discover their "incompatibility." (5) Although the marriage of either 
to a third person is unlawful, yet if done it annuls the betrothal 
previously made. (6) The extreme youth of the betrothed, or either of 
them, may render the promise void, because it required full use of 
judgment and will to bind one's self for life-long obligations. <p>

Even if the betrothal were confirmed by an oath, it would be dissolved 
under these conditions. <p>

But ordinary misfortunes are not a just plea for release from the 
promise formally made and accepted. Herein civil law seems to be 
essentially just. <p>

(Qu. 1. Suppose that one of the parties to the "engagement" find it 
impossible to take the marriage vow to "love," etc., is the other bound 
to release from the contract, while securing damages for breach of 
promise? (See Irving's case, found in Froude's Life of Carlyle.) 
<!--
THE CONTRACT. 627 
--><A NAME="p627"></a>
 Qu. 2. Can a priest lawfully bless a marriage with a third party when
the previous contract has not been released?<p>

Qu. 3. Suppose that seduction has followed promise of marriage, is it a 
"constructive" marriage? It may be so construed in an exterior 
tribunal, nothing appearing to the contrary, because the consummation 
of marriage may be supposed to have followed mutual consent to the 
bond. But <i>in foro conscientiae</i> a promise concerning the future 
is not a valid marriage bond, and the act charged is simply the deadly 
sin of fornication. But usually the only reparation possible is, of 
course, the solemnization of marriage between the guilty persons. <p>

Qu. 4. Suppose that parents refuse their assent after the betrothal? 
Minors certainly sin gravely if they engage themselves without parents' 
consent, and the contract is void. But if the parties be of full age, 
judgment must be made between the reverence due to parents' counsel and 
the rights of children to order their own life.)  <p>

How is the contract of marriage made? (1) Consent must be mutual and 
<i> de praesenti</i>; (2) it must be voluntary and deliberate consent; 
(3) it must be manifested by outward signs. If these three be all the 
requisite conditions of valid matrimony, it follows that a contract of 
this kind secretly made, though it is grave violation of the laws of 
God and man, and in the case of Christians forfeits all claim to the 
blessing of the sacrament, yet is a valid marriage, gives the rights 
and creates the obligations of matrimony, and must not be repeated. 
Although there is contempt of God, yet the two parties have the 
disposal of their own persons, and of all that marriage requires. The 
evil results following from such marriage without witnesses are too 
apparent to call for any justification of the laws of Church and State 
in this matter. <p>

A conditional consent to the contract, though highly improper, would 
not invalidate the contract or the sacrament 
<!--
628 HOLY MATRIMONY. 
--><A NAME="p628"></a>
 (1) if the condition be verified, and (2) be not inconsistent with the 
ends of matrimony. Thus, if the condition were that the nuptial debt 
shall not be paid, there would be no marriage. Again, if the condition 
affect simply the past or present, the marriage stands if the condition 
prove true. If the condition be <i>de futuro</i> -- <i>e.g.</i>, "I now 
marry you if you make your will in my favor within six months," or "if 
you join the Church," the marriage is not perfected until the 
conditions of it are fulfilled. Needless to say that no priest of the 
Church can lawfully have any share in such a conditional contract.  <p>

A more difficult question is that of fictitious consent. If both 
parties have "married in joke," conscience can find in the fictitious 
contract no obligation; although external tribunals, considering how 
easily this pr../resource for dissolving marriage may be fraudulently 
employed, may be slow in accepting it. If the parties have treated one 
another as man and wife, this must be held to be true inward consent to 
the outward contract. <p>

A more difficult case is where there has been sincere consent on one 
side and fictitious consent is asserted on the other. Certainly the 
parties are bound to separate until the error is rectified. If the 
reputed marriage have been consummated there is the obligation of 
giving a true consent to the contract. <p>

(Qu.: If the marriage be not consummated, can the parties in such a 
case have the contract annulled by mutual consent?)  <p>

The consent may be given for some base end, as when one marries in 
order to get a fortune; but this does not affect the outward contract 
or the sacrament. There is valid matrimony without the grace which God 
gives to a devout seeker for it. So far the case is parallel to that of 
one who baptizes for pay, or who simoniacally buys the 
<!--
IMPEDIMENTS. 629 
--><A NAME="p629"></a>
 sacraments. The evil end is accidental to the sacrament; it belongs to 
the contracting party, not to God's institution.  <p>

<i>Marriage of minors</i>. Consent of parents is not necessary for a 
valid contract, since by the law of nature parents have not power over 
their children's souls and bodies in such a life-long relation as 
matrimony involves. If they had, they could also make void a marriage 
vow, which is absurd to maintain. But reverence and obedience may make 
such a marriage unlawful before God, as before the state. And the 
priest gravely sins against God and against society who marries a minor 
without the parents' consent, except under pressure of the gravest 
moral necessity -- <i>e.g., gravida puella</i>. <p>

It will be remembered that contracts in general made by minors are not 
bound on them by law, though the other party, if adult, is so bound; 
and the former, not the latter, can sue for breach of promise 
(Blackst. i. 436). <p>

Yet, in conscience, if the minor have full possession of his powers of 
judgment, and the contract be not an injurious one, he is morally bound 
to fulfil it when he reaches age of independence. And this principle 
includes the contract of marriage.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. Impediments.</h4><p>

Impediments to valid marriage may arise from the law of nature, and no 
human power can alter it or remove them. Impediments to marriage, as a 
sacrament of the Church, may arise from God's revealed law binding on 
His Church. And, finally, as a social state, marriage may be prohibited 
by civil laws, which vary in different places and ages of the world. 
This distinction among impediments is important to observe in 
considering them. <p>

It will be understood that these impediments must exist as such at the 
time of celebrating the nuptial rite. If any 
<!--
630 HOLY MATRIMONY. 
--><A NAME="p630"></a>
 of them should afterwards occur, it would not annul a valid marriage. <p>

Impediments to matrimony may be (1) only prohibitory, "impedientia;" 
<i>i.e.</i>, the marriage is unlawful, but it is valid when made. <p>

(1) Prohibitory impediments are: (a) lack of consent from parents in 
the case of minors, which has already been noticed; (b) previous 
espousals, when the party to them has not been released from the 
contract, also noticed above; (c) clandestine marriage. Since marriage 
involves social relations, the state may require security for a public 
contract, and violation of such laws will constitute an unlawful 
clandestine marriage. And it is certainly an obligation of the priest 
to conform to civil law in this matter, and in all others where the law 
of the state does not contravene the law of the Church, which is 
supreme in matters of religion, and Christian matrimony is certainly a 
matter of religion. If the two authorities oppose one another, the 
conscientious priest can only say, "We must obey God rather than man." <p>

But the Church herself, also, has always strictly regulated this matter 
of the publicity of Holy Matrimony. The English canon, requiring three 
publications of the banns, fixing the hour between eight and twelve in 
the forenoon, the place as the parish church of one of the parties, 
sufficientlv shows that the English Church forbids clandestine 
marriage. The American Church, tolerating the absence of most of these 
precautions, has certainly not abolished them all. For the parish 
priest, according to her canon, is still the only lawful minister, in 
this as in any other religious rite; although license may be said to be 
tacitly given when he knows of the interference of another and does not 
protest against it. Clandestine marriage, then, must be defined as 
marriage celebrated without due cognizance of (1) the Church, (2) the 
State, and (3) -- in the case of minors -- the parents. 
<!--
IMPEDIMENTS. 631  
--><A NAME="p631"></a>
 Clandestine marriage is grave sin in the parties and in a priest who 
sanctions it, except under the gravest necessity. <p>

(Qu.: Is it not an unlawful clandestine marriage when the parties leave 
the State or the parish in order to evade the civil or the 
ecclesiastical law?) <p>

(d) There are certain seasons of the Christian year when the marriage 
of Christians, with its accompanying festivities, is unbecoming. Such 
seasons as Lent and Advent, therefore, are by the ancient 
ecclesiastical law of the Anglican Church prohibited seasons; and 
although toleration of contrary custom may be held to be virtual 
abrogation of a purely positive law, yet, the reason for it still 
remaining, it must be held to be at least decent that the marriage at 
such seasons shall, if celebrated at all, be as quiet and private as 
the nature of the service admits. (e) A vow of celibacy, not duly 
released, is a prohibitory impediment. (Qu.: (f) If civil law bind 
the priest, when it is not in conflict with higher law, may not 
prohibitory impediments arise from this source?)<p>

(2) <i>Impedimenta dirimentia</i>. These make a marriage, in the view 
of the Church, void <i>ab initio</i>, although some of them may render 
it simply voidable in common law; <i>i.e.</i>, the rights of marriage 
last until the sentence of the court annulling the marriage. Thus the 
children, if any, will be legitimate, etc. <p>

These impediments, so far as Christian marriage is concerned, rest upon 
the law of the Church, for she has authority from Christ in this 
matter, since such authority is necessary for the government of the 
Christian society. The law of the state she cannot recognize, if any 
such law should interfere with her duty to the souls which are under 
her authority. For the Church alone has power in matters of religion, 
power to bind and to loose (S. Matt. xviii. 18). <p>

The state, on the other hand, regulates only the outward civil 
contract, with its results. The education of children, 
<!--
632 HOLY MATRIMONY. 
--><A NAME="p632"></a>
 therefore, involves the same principles; they are destined to become 
citizens of the state, but they are already, by baptism, members of the 
household of God. The state has the right to demand that they be duly 
prepared for future citizenship, but the Church has the obligation and 
power to train them as members of the society to which they belong. If 
the Church does her duty to her children, what the state requires will 
be duly provided for, and the state will have no further claim in the 
matter. <p>

<i>Invincible ignorance</i> of an existing impediment does not render 
the marriage valid, for there was not in the beginning any true 
contract of marriage, and the law is not conditioned by the knowledge 
or the ignorance of those who are subject to it. <p>

And, furthermore, although prescription may establish various civil 
claims -- <i>e.g.</i>, in this case those of children -- no lapse of 
time can make wrong to become right, or render valid a union which was 
never Christian marriage at all. Separation <i>a thoro</i> appears to 
be the only alternative in such a ease. The hardship of it is parallel 
with that of physical or mental disease. <p>

These impediments, it will be observed, directly and primarily affect 
the nuptial contract; indirectly; and secondarily, the marriage 
sacrament. They are <p>

(a) Error. This is either substantial or "accidental" -- that is, it 
either concerns the person, or the qualities of the person. If the 
error were of the former kind, there was never any true contract, and 
the marriage was void <i>ab initio</i>. For consent is the cause of 
matrimony, as we have seen; and what avoids consent, avoids matrimony. 
But consent, the act of the will, presupposes an understanding of what 
is consented to. This being absent, there is no true consent. This is 
the law of nature respecting contracts in general. <p>

But there may be error, even with accompanying fraud, respecting the 
qualities of the person married. The person 
<!--
IMPEDIMENTS. 633 
--><A NAME="p633"></a>
 is poor, sickly, quarrelsome, of intemperate habits, a widow, a false 
nobleman, etc. None of these things affect the essence of the contract, 
and it must stand, even if it would not have been made in case the 
circumstances were known. This is the law of both Church and state.  <p>

(b) Consanguinity is the natural relationship of those descended from 
the same father or mother, or both. As an impediment to marriage, it 
depends partly upon the law of nature, partly on Divinely revealed law, 
and partly upon human positive law. And these may establish different 
degrees of prohibitory consanguinity. <p>

Observe that the question of legitimate descent does not enter into 
consideration. <p>

The line of cognation is either direct or collateral; direct, as 
between parent and child; collateral, as between brother and sister. 
The student of the subject is liable to be confused at first in the 
numbering of degrees, since the civil law numbers in different mode 
from the canon law. It will be convenient for our purpose to adopt the 
degrees of the civil code, which reckons the number of persons 
concerned. Thus, either grandchild or sister stands in the second 
degree; first cousins, in the third degree, etc. <p>

According to the canon law, as will be seen in the accompanying table, 
brothers and sisters are related in the first degree, first cousins in 
the second degree; the reckoning being made from the middle line. It 
will appear from the table that by ascending one more degree, and then 
descending to right and left, we should have cognates in the fourth 
degree, and so on. (See table of degrees.) <p>

In the direct line, ascending and descending, consanguinity avoids 
marriage indefinitely. This is ruled by the law of nature. For the 
relation of husband and wife is inconsistent with that of parent and 
child. But the Divine revealed law goes further, and protects the 
family relation by prohibiting marriage to those who are ordinarily 
associated 
<!--
634 HOLY MATRIMONY. 
--><A NAME="p634"></a>
 already by the intimate ties of the family. In other words, marriage 
is prohibited within the third degree, inclusive (degrees of civil 
law). This is the Levitical code, and the law of the Anglican Church, 
and courts of common law will treat such marriages as voidable 
(Blackst. i. 434). <p>

It will be observed that half-brothers and sisters count as those 
related through the same father and mother. <p>

Positive canon law has varied in extending still further prohibited 
degrees. The modern Roman Church prohibits marriage within the fourth 
degree, inclusive (canonical degrees); but the law being merely a 
positive ecclesiastical regulation grounded on the already existing 
intimacy of the relatives, dispensation from it may be obtained when 
good reasons are presented. <p>

The Church cannot claim the power of dispensing from Divine law; and 
the question must therefore present itself how far this law extends. 
Beyond brothers and sisters (<i>i.e.</i>, second degree), the question 
may possibly belong to positive ecclesiastical law.  <p>

(c) <i>Affinity</i>. This is created by conjugal union, whether licit 
or illicit. The Divine law says, "They are no more twain, but one 
flesh" (S. Matt. xix. 6). The husband becomes related to his wife's 
family as he is connected by blood with his own. And the wife takes the 
same position with respect to her husband's relatives. Affinity, 
therefore, according to the law of the Anglican Church and the common 
law, follows the same rules with consanguinity. The death of husband or 
wife leaves affinity unchanged, because, like consanguinity, it depends 
upon a past act which is unalterable; <i>sc.</i>, that man and wife 
have been conjoined and become one flesh; not that they are so 
conjoined. <p>

S. Paul explicitly extends the principle here involved to unlawful 
concubinage (1 Cor. vi. 16). <p>

This seems to rest upon a law of nature. For if affinity create no such

 --><A NAME="p635"></a>mother, which Revelation declares to be an abomination (Lev. xviii. 
8). At the same time it is to be noticed that the limit of prohibitory 
degrees of affinity seems to be a question of positive Church law. And 
as the bond is not so close as that of consanguinity, marriages may be 
allowed in the one which would be prohibited in the other. So the Roman 
canons, extending prohibited affinity to the fourth degree (canonical 
degrees) in case of lawful union, set the limit at the second degree in 
case of unlawful union. <p>

No affinity is created between the blood relations of husband and wife. 
Two brothers may marry two sisters, or father and son may marry mother 
and daughter; or the father may marry the daughter and his son may 
marry the mother, etc. "Affinitas non parit affinitatem."  <p>

(d) Fear or force. For our purpose these are the same, since we mean by 
either of them an excessive disturbance of mind through fear of present 
or future danger of life or person. Such an excessive fear avoids 
marriage when the cause is external, the force unjust, and impelling to 
the contract. If these conditions be absent, fear does not annul the 
contract. <p>

Parents may urge an unwelcome marriage upon a child. If a daughter were 
overwhelmed with fear of her parents' dIspleasure, it might be 
maintained that there was no free consent. But, on the other hand, the 
pressure exerted may be that of arguments and persuasions, and then the 
compulsion will be a moral force, not that which constitutes a true 
impediment to valid marriage. <p>

The violence which avoids marriage is the carrying off of a woman under 
protest for the purpose of marriage. <p>

If threats be used against a seducer to compel his promised marriage 
with his victim, the force is not unjust and the contract is valid.  <p>

(e) Impotence. Physical impotence or mental malady will annul the 
contract of matrimony; in the former case, 
<!--
636 HOLY MATRIMONY. 
--><A NAME="p636"></a>
 because of impossibility of fulfilling all of its obligations; in the 
latter case, because no contract is made, since that implies a 
deliberate and intelligent consent. Physical impotence, however, will 
not be a bar to a valid sacrament, if it be known to the parties 
married. <p>

Since the contract is for life, neither of these, if it follow after 
marriage, can annul what has once been validly done.  <p>

(f) Age. Under seven years of age, a pretended marriage is absolutely 
void <i>ab initio</i>. Over that age it is voidable; <i>i.e.</i>, the 
party concerned, on reaching the age of legal consent or marriageable 
age, may annul the contract. The age at which marriage becomes valid, 
though unlawful -- <i>i.e.</i>, the age of "legal consent" -- is fixed 
by Church law and the common law at fourteen for males, and twelve for 
females. But note the changes made by laws in some of the United 
States. (See Blackst. i. 436.)  <p>

(g) <i>Crime</i>. Formal adultery -- <i>i.e.</i>, the crime committed 
with knowledge of an existing marriage relation -- is a bar to 
matrimony between the guilty parties. Two adulterers may not marry at 
the death of husband or wife. <p>

Or if the lawful partner be murdered in order to marry another; if 
there were mutual conspiracy, it would be profaning holy things to 
give the Church's benediction on such a contract. <p>

(Qu.: Suppose, in either of these cases, repentance, confession, 
absolution?)  <p>

(ii) Disparity of religion. This can be no impediment to a valid civil 
contract sanctioned by the laws of the state to which the parties 
belong. But the case is altered if we have before us the Christian 
union which the Church contemplates. An unbaptized person is incapable 
of entering into it. Matrimony with such a person is not the sacrament 
of Holy Matrimony. The Church cannot give her 
<!--
IMPEDIMENTS. 637 
--><A NAME="p637"></a>
 benediction upon the union, and the priest who should consciously 
repeat the words in such a case would be guilty of a profane fiction (2 
Cor. vi. 14). For Christian marriage has for one of its chief goods the 
training of children as the children of God; which, in the case 
supposed, is excluded by the wilful rejection of the baptismal 
covenant. <p>

But since the contract lawfully made is valid matrimony so far as it 
goes, though it be imperfect matrimony from the Christian point of 
view, two wedded unbelievers received into Christ's fold will not be 
remarried, but may receive the nuptial benediction. <p>

(Qu.: On the other hand, if the state annul their contract, will the 
Church regard it as binding on their conscience if they be converted to 
the Christian faith?) <p>

Special difficulties of conscience occur where one partner in the 
marriage tie is converted to the Christian faith and is baptized, while 
the other is not. Frequent as such cases are, the moral conditions vary 
extremely, and this brief manual is not the place for their discussion. 
Only it must be insisted on that laws of nature and the moral law of 
God are irreversible by any human power. And they are binding even on 
those who are ignorant of them, for they could know them if they would. 
On the other hand, ecclesiastical positive law can be suspended, the 
power of dispensation being in the Church which makes the law, and the 
exercise of that power in general being in the ordinary of the diocese 
where the case occurs. Such cases being frequent in the early Church, 
are partly ruled by S. Paul (1 Cor. vii.). The convert may not separate 
from the unbeliever, if no serious hindrance to the Christian life 
arise from the union; children in such a family have claims which the 
Church must recognize, etc. <p>

(Qu. 1. Suppose that the marriage has been one within the prohibited 
degrees. If it be prohibited by the Divine law, it remains unlawful. If 
prohibited only by the positive law of the Church, it may be sanctioned 
by the power of dispensation. 
<!--
638 HOLY MATRIMONY.  
--><A NAME="p638"></a><p>

Qu. 2. Suppose, again, the frequent case of a convert where a second 
civil marriage has been consummated while there is still living a 
previously married husband or wife, the state having annulled the first 
contract. There has been no sacrament of Holy Matrimony in either 
marriage. What does the law of nature require concerning the permanence 
of the marriage tie, and can the state dispense from the law of nature? <p>

Qu. 3. Suppose that one of two so divorced parties becomes a convert to 
the Christian faith, is that person free to marry in the Lord if the 
unbeliever have fundamentally broken the marriage vow?)<p>

<i>Denunciation of impediments</i>. This is an obligation on every one 
who has reasonable ground of suspicion of their existence, whether 
those impediments are "impedientia" or "dirimentia." (See the preface 
to the Anglican marriage service.) Not even an oath to keep the 
objection secret will be binding against grave injury done to the 
community or to a third person. <p>

(Qu. 1. Suppose a confidential communication officially made to the 
physician, the lawyer, the priest, not in confession, is not this a 
possible exception? <p>

Qu. 2. Suppose that grave injury will be done to the revealer of the 
impediment?) <p>

One credible witness presenting an impediment, even <i>impediens</i>, 
must stop the ceremony until the case can be investigated, due security 
for indemnification being provided. (See the rubric in the marriage 
service.)  <p>

<i>Doubtful cases</i>. Suppose that the parties to the proposed union 
are in doubt respecting the existence of an impediment to their union. 
The doubt may concern an impediment arising (1) from Divine law or 
the law of nature; or, (2) from positive ecclesiastical law. The first 
will require moral certainty for a favourable decision, for the Church 
<!--
IMPEDIMENTS. 639 
--><A NAME="p639"></a>
 cannot supply the defect by her power of dispensation; e.g., one 
supposes that his partner is dead (<i>Enoch Arden</i>). If the fact be 
not so, however strong has been the probability of it, and whatever 
civil authority may have decided, the second union will be no Christian 
marriage. <p>

But, in the second case, if doubt remain after careful inquiry, and the 
doubt concern the fact, not the law, the marriage cannot be 
celebrated. But if the same doubt arise after marriage, under the same 
conditions the marriage must he regarded as valid. <p>

(Qu.: A case of special difficulty is where a marriage, invalid 
according to Divinely revealed law, hts been already contracted in good 
faith -- say, before the conversion of the party to it -- and 
children's claims, etc., have arisen from it, and there is probability 
of infamy, scandal, etc., if its nullity be publicly exposed. Shall the 
material sin be left? Is the case like that of restitution due, when 
the debtor is in good faith? In such a case may restitution be left 
unrequired, if it be foreseen that admonition will work grave injury, 
and effect no countervailing good? <p>

A plain exception to the laxer course, if it be admitted at all, is (1) 
when the public good overrules the advantage of an individual; (2) when 
the penitent's conscience is alarmed and asks the question of moral 
obligation and validity of marriage. Then, if the marriage were by 
Divine law void ab initio, let the penitent live as if unmarried.)  <p>

<i>Rehabilitation</i>. This is the perfecting of Christian marriage 
between parties who have lived together as man and wife. Its 
principles are implied in what has been already written, but they may 
be summed up in this place as follows: <p>

(1) If there have been no true consent to matrimony, on one side or on 
both, such consent may be given privately, or before confidential 
witnesses, and the nuptial benediction received. 
<!--
640 HOLY MATRIMONY.  
--><A NAME="p640"></a> <p>

(2) If clandestine marriage have been duly blessed by a priest, the 
form is empty of blessing, but repentance may restore it. Or if there 
have leen a ceremony, binding, indeed, on conscience, but celebrated by 
some justice of the peace, some Protestant minister, or other person 
who cannot give the nuptial benediction, there may be a private 
perfecting of the marriage in the presence of confidential witnesses, 
without scandal or loss of good name. (Say, the latter part of the 
marriage service, "I pronounce, etc.," together with the blessing.) <p>

(3) Suppose that public scandal has already been given by the conduct 
of the parties; their duty requires them to make public reparation by a 
public ceremony. <p>

(Qu.: Suppose that only one of the two consents to this reparation; may 
not the bishop give dispensation, and a private ceremony be 
celebrated?) <p>

(4) Again, there may have been an impediment known to exist at the tine 
of marriage, so that the ceremony was null <i>ab initio</i>, and this 
impediment may have been afterwards removed. In such a case, the 
consent of the parties can be privately renewed; or, if the impediment 
be publicly known, the consent can be renewed before witnesses; that 
is, the marriage service which was null before will be duly celebrated.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 5. Divorce.</h4><p>

The inseparability of man and wife is part of the law of nature (S. 
Matt. xix. 4-6). God has joined them so that "they are no more 
twain, but one flesh;" and "what God hath [so] joined, let not man put 
asunder." Children are the common good of man and wife; the family 
relation is in its very nature a permanent one; and as this requires 
the indissoluble union of man and wife, such a union is part of 
nature's law. <p>

But only the law of Christ has restored that perfect law of nature to 
its due perfection. 
<!--
DIVORCE. 641  
--><A NAME="p641"></a><p>

But if this be true of the marriage contract, much rather is it true of 
the sacrament of Holy Matrimony in the Church, a mystical 
representation of the inseparable union of Christ and the Church. In 
the life-time of husband or wife it is impossible for the other to be 
married again. The ceremony is a nullity (1 Cor. vii. 10, 39). Many of 
the United States confound divorce <i>a vinculo</i> with divorce <i>a 
mensa et thoro</i>. But the distinction is fundamental in Moral 
Theology, and well guarded in common law also.  <p>

Divorce <i>a vinculo</i> is based on <i>impedimenta dirimentia</i>, 
which must have existed at the time of the pretended nuptial contract. 
The Western Church, at least, including the Anglican canon law, allows 
no such divorce for crime occurring after marriage (Blackat. i. 441). <p>

But compare the canon of the American Church, title ii. 13 "No minister 
of this Church shall solemnize matrimony in any case where there is a 
divorced wife or husband of either party still living; but this canon 
shall not be held to apply to the innocent party in a divorce for the 
cause of adultery," etc. This may seem to be sanctioning such a 
marriage "by indirection." <p>

<i>Per contra</i>, in this difficult question note the arguments of S. 
Augustine, De Adult. Conjug. (comparing with his Retract.) i. 6, 7, ad. 
fin., 22 ad fin.; ii. 1, etc. He seems to know no Church discipline in 
the matter; and naturally so, for marriages with unbelievers (as 
standing on a different basis), common as they were, would tend to 
confuse legislation. But he thinks that S. Matthew gives no warrant for 
remarriage.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

Does the innocent party cease to be spouse because of the other's 
guilt? Can an evil-doer thus annul a bilateral con<!--
642 HOLY MATRIMONY.  
 -->tract? If so, the guilty also is free to marry (the ordinary course 
in the United States). Divorce a there is not divorce <i>a vinculo</i> 
(a distinction easy to be overlooked in the ordinary quotations from 
primitive sources). Objection may be made (ii. 10) that this law of 
indissolubility is a severe one for the innocent. But incurable disease 
or any separation <i>a mensa et thoro</i> is equally so. A contentions, 
offensive, imperious wife is sent away; a good wife is abandoned by a 
drunken sot; is there freedom on both sides in such a case because of 
the manifest hardship? (Cp. Canon of 1603, No. 107.) <p>

To the same effect S. Augustine argues in De Bono Conjug., c. 7. The 
law of God is not subject to the varying and imperfect human law.  <p>

<i>Divorce a thoro</i>, whether sanctioned by the state or privately 
made, is certainly lawful for grave causes, for a serious breach of 
contract by one of the two parties may release the other from its 
obligations. The state does not make the divorce, but sanctions it with 
reference to the civil rights involved. This separation is permitted, 
not commanded (S. Matt. v. 32). The innocent may pardon the offence, 
even in case of adultery, not as condoning sin, but as forgiving the 
penitent; for divorce is not a penalty for the innocent (Duct. 
Dubitant. I. iv. 8). <p>

There are cases, however, when sound morals will forbid a separation, 
even in case of adultery; <i>e.g.</i>, both parties may be equally 
guilty in this respect; or the innocent may have condoned the offence 
by subsequent cohabitation; or, after long absence, it may have been 
supposed that the absent partner is dead, etc. <p>

This separation for good and sufficient reasons may be made by mutual 
consent, provided there be no danger of incontinence, or other grave 
injury. <p>

Grave danger to body or soul -- <i>e.g.</i>, danger of perversion or 
apostasy -- may even make separation become a positive duty. 
<!--
DIVORCE. 643  
--><A NAME="p643"></a>
 At the same time, it may be well to caution the inexperienced priest 
not to lend a ready ear to all complaints, especially of wives, but to 
remember that his once is that of peace-maker, not of encouraging 
separation and neglect of vows, where the other course is possible. <p>

It will not be overlooked that man and woman in making the marriage 
contract are on a footing of absolute equality, and any breach of that 
contract is in itself of the same criminality, whether husband or wife 
be the guilty party, although the wife's sin may involve more injurious 
consequences, and so become a graver offence. <p>

<hr><p>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a></a> This view is controverted. But the question will not take a  
practical shape when the law of the Church is obeyed. <p>

<a name="n_2"><a href="#n2">{2}</a></a> In S. Matt. xix. 9, the adultery of the wife is understood to be the 
ground of the putting her away, not the justification of a second 
marriage.<p>
