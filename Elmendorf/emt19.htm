<h3>PART IV. -- SUPPLEMENT.  INTRODUCTION.</h3><p>

S. THOMAS AQUINAS did not live to complete the Summa. His editors have 
tried to supply what is wanting from his other works. For the purpose 
which the present writer has in view he will freely use the materials 
thus provided, or any other standard authorities, such as the <i>Doctor 
Dubitantium</i> of Bishop Taylor, the contributions to our science made 
by Sanderson when he was professor at Oxford, or any others.<p>

No attempt is made to consider all possible cases; only such are 
selected as are most likely to occur, or are most serviceable 
illustrations and expansions of what has preceded. It was said in the 
preface, but may now be repeated, that only a cursory glance can here 
be given at many topics -- <i>e.g.</i>, the obligations of the state 
and the citizen -- for each such topic would require a volume. Nothing 
more can be aimed at than to indicate, before this Supplement is 
concluded, some of the problems which Moral Theology must consider, 
since their solution belongs to the law of God, although those problems 
are here left unsolved.<p>

To prove every proposition laid down in a brief manual of this kind 
would be practically impossible. And the elements of every science 
require the writer of them to assume a dogmatic tone even when proof 
could readily be furnished. Let it suffice, then, that the present 
writer has taken his utmost pains to lay down no proposition which does 
not express either the common law of the Catholic Church
<!--

 or direct deduction from the revealed law of God. Where he may have 
erred he submits his judgment to the lawful authority, duly expressed, 
of the Church from which he has received his commission as priest and 
teacher.<p> 

Some questions which seemed open to discussion among those who are 
loyal to the moral authority of the Christian Church have been 
indicated in parentheses, even when the writer might for his own part 
regard some of them as closed questions.<p>
