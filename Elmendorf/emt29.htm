<h3>CHAPTER X.  HOLY ORDERS.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Introductory.</h4><p>

The doctrine of Holy Orders, their divine origin, their authority and 
functions, cannot here be discussed. But some few propositions, 
familiar to Churchmen, but wholly rejected or unknown by the great 
majority of religious people among us, must here be assumed. For he who 
believes the truth revealed from God in this matter -- <i>sc.</i>, the 
Divine authority of the Christian priesthood -- necessarily finds a law 
binding upon himself, whether he be priest or layman, and he must 
answer before God for his obedience to it. Whereas, on the other hand, 
he who knows no such truth, knows no law in this matter; while the 
Protestant scoffer at "sacerdotalism" is only consistent in scoffing at 
the law, which, perhaps, if he be a priest, he has sworn before God 
that he will diligently observe and keep. <p>

The existence of Holy Orders as a Divine institution in the Catholic 
Church is based upon the existence of sacraments, and especially of the 
Holy Eucharist as sacrament and as sacrifice. Preaching the Gospel, the 
prophetical office, is superadded; but, important as it is, it is not 
of the essence of Holy Orders. Any Christian man may be licensed, if 
the Church see fit, to carry the Gospel to the world. The fountain of 
this authority, indeed, is the apostolic office, for apostles and their 
successors were bidden to carry the Gospel to all the world, assured 
that their Lord would be with them in doing so until the consummation 
of all earthly history. God has set prophets in His Church after 
apostles. Not all are apostles; not all are prophets (1 Cor. xii. 
28).
<!--
INTRODUCTORY. 611  
--><A NAME="p611"></a><p>

But holy Orders are ordained for the external ministration of 
sacraments. The Lord said, "Make disciples of all nations, baptizing 
them into the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Ghost" (S. Matt. xviii. 20); "This do in remembrance of Me" (S. Luke 
xxii. 19) "Receive ye the Holy Ghost; whosesoever sins ye forgive, they 
are forgiven unto them, etc." (S. John xx. 22). All visible authority 
is summed up in the apostles, by them to be divided and distributed to 
various orders and offices in the Church, under the guidance of the 
holy Spirit. The apostles were "deacons" of the Church (and so are 
their successors), but they gave this function of the one ministry to 
chosen men (Acts vi. 6). The apostles were priests (and their 
successors may be vested as priests and do the priest's peculiar work 
of consecrating the Holy Eucharist), but the Church needed resident 
priests wherever the faithful were found and required their 
ministration. Therefore the apostles gave this function to others (1 
Tim. v. 22 Tit. i. 5). But they reserved to themselves and those whom, 
like S. Matthias or Barnabas or Timothy, they associated with 
themselves in the full authority of their office, the general power to 
dispense sacred things, and to rule the Church. The Church of Christ, 
as an organized, visible body, was found wherever their authority was 
found. Where there was no such authority there could be no organized 
and visible Church. <p>

<i>Difference in orders</i>, then, depends upon the different degrees 
of participation in the fulness of the apostolic commission. The body 
of Christ has many members, "and all the members have not the same 
office" (Rom. xii. 6; 1 Cor xii. 5. See Art. xxiii.). But each and all 
are servants of their brethren; they minister, not "in their own name, 
but in Christ's, by His commission and authority," received directly 
from those to whom He has previously given it. <p>

"It is evident unto all men, diligently reading Holy 
<!--
612 HOLY ORDERS. 
--><A NAME="p612"></a>
 Scripture and ancient authors, that from the apostles' time there have 
been these orders of ministers in Christ's Church -- bishops, priests, 
and deacons." And so, since the law of faith is the law of prayer, we 
pray in the Collect at the Ordering of Priests, "Almighty God, giver of 
all good things, who by Thy Holy Spirit hast appointed divers orders of 
ministers in Thy Church, etc." He who does not believe this, has no 
right to profane the service of God by presenting himself to receive 
such a holy office. <p>

A devout Christian is not a priest because he is a good man. In the 
inward and spiritual order, indeed, he is one of the "holy priesthood, 
to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus 
Christ." He has a "holy priesthood" (1 S. Pet. ii. 5); but in the 
outward order he is not an apostle, he is neither king nor priest in 
the visible Church. For all are not apostles having authority to rule 
and it is not grace which is conferred by the visible priest, but the 
sacraments of grace, while God only can bestow the inward part. A good 
man can teach by word and example; he may be licensed to read Holy 
Scripture in public, to use public prayers with the faithful; even, if 
law permit, to exercise the prophetic office which he receives from the 
successors of the apostles; but the existence of sacraments, as has 
been said, implies men consecrated for this instrumental service 
without which necessary grace cannot in general be had.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Holy Orders a sacrament.</h4><p>

There is (1) "an outward and visible sign" -- <i>sc.</i>, the laying on 
of hands -- (2) "of an inward and spiritual grace" (3) "ordained by 
Christ Himself as a means whereby we receive the same and a pledge to 
assure us thereof." But Holy Orders have not "like nature of sacraments 
with Baptism and Holy Eucharist." And this will be evident enough when 
we consider the matter and the form, and compare them with the two 
sacraments "generally necessary to salvation." 
<!--
HOLY ORDERS A SACRAMENT. 613  
--><A NAME="p613"></a><p>

In the latter case there is an indispensable material thing required 
without which there can be no sacrament. Not so in the ordering of 
bishops, priests, and deacons.  <p>

<i>The matter.</i> If, then, in a general way, we define Holy Orders as 
a "sacrament of the Church in which is given spiritual authority, and 
grace is conferred for due performance of ecclesiastical offices," we 
shall keep ourselves within the sure boundaries of our faith; but if 
we undertake to find dogmatically the essential "matter" and form of 
words, we may involve ourselves in needless difficulties. It is enough 
for Anglican Churchmen to know, and for Anglican theology to affirm, 
that the laying on of hands is an apostolic sign attached to this 
conferring of authority by those who have authority.  <p>

The state of the case is not very different with respect to the oral 
sign, the form of words in this sacrament. In Holy Baptism and Holy 
Eucharist there is a form of words unvarying from the beginning and 
throughout the Catholic Church. But if we seek for any such form in 
Ordination we may fail to find it. The intent is plain enough in all 
varying forms. It is the transmission of authority from him who 
possesses it with power to confer it. "Take thou authority to execute 
the office of a deacon in the Church of God committed unto thee, in the 
Name, etc." Alternative forms, accordingly, in the Ordering of Priests, 
however originated, will create no difficulty, nor tend to invalidate 
the sacrament. "Receive the Holy Ghost for the office and work of a 
priest in the Church of God;" or "Take thou authority to execute the 
office of a priest in the Church of God now committed unto thee by the 
imposition of our hands " -- these are equivalent forms, and if they 
are not vain and idle ceremony, which God forbid, they are equally 
God's means for conferring the inward and spiritual grace of the 
sacrament. 
<!--
614 HOLY ORDERS.  
--><A NAME="p614"></a><p>

<i>The grace</i>. This is, (1) a consecration whereby the servant of 
Christ becomes a dispenser of sacramental grace to others. That can be 
truly said to him which was said to S. Timothy "Neglect not the gift 
that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on 
of the hands of the presbytery;" or, more definitely still, "Stir up 
the gift of God which is in thee through the laying on of (apostolic) 
hands" (1 Tim. iv. 14; 2 Tim. i. 6). <p>

(2) In the ordination to the priesthood (Qu.: ordination to the 
diaconate?) is imprinted an indelible "character" on the soul. Even 
the degraded priest remains forever a priest who has consecrated and 
touched the Lord's sacramental Body. Holy Orders, therefore, can under 
no possible circumstances be reiterated.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. The law.</h4><p>

The special and positive laws enacted in local canons are binding on 
conscience, because the Church has authority from God in making them. 
But examination of them does not belong to our subject. And, on the 
other hand, the solemn, tender warnings of the Church which are uttered 
by the ordaining bishop before he gives the heavenly grace are such as 
the priest cannot too often make his earnest study. But nothing can be 
added to them. Our present task is the considering those necessary 
deductions from the doctrine of Holy Orders, which have formed a part 
of the law of the Church Catholic, and are therefore part of the moral 
law which guides our conscience. <p>

(1) Holy Baptism is the door to all the sacramental rites of the 
Church; therefore Holy Orders presuppose baptism, and the supposed 
conferring of them is null in the ease of an unbaptized man. He is 
incapable of receiving that character which holy Orders stamp on the 
soul prepared for its reception. He cannot absolve penitents, nor 
consecrate a valid Eucharist. If the error be discovered, he should he 
baptized, and then receive valid orders. If he 
<!--
THE LAW. 615 
--><A NAME="p615"></a>
 were advanced to the episcopate, he could not confer valid orders, but 
the gracious gifts of the great high Priest are not conditioned, on His 
part, by the imperfections and errors of His ministers; neither is it 
to be believed that He will permit such error as this to lie hidden. <p>

It will also be noticed that the Catholic Church has provided against 
the perpetuation of this error, or any other such error, by requiring 
that three bishops unite in the lawful consecration to the episcopate. <p>

Confirmation, though eminently proper, is not essential to the 
receiving of Holy Orders. It is not essential, because the baptized man 
is capable of this special grace; it is eminently proper, because the 
minister of Christ peculiarly needs what Confirmation confers.  <p>

(2) He who receives Holy Orders in a state of mortal sin is validly 
ordained, and his official acts confer a grace which he does not 
himself possess. He condemns himself in receiving ordination; he 
condemns himself whenever he officiates in such a state of sin;  
holy things for holy persons is the law of the Church, the law of God. 
But there is no need of perplexed conscience on his part, as if he must 
sin in officiating, and sin in not officiating; for he can repent of 
his sin, or he can resign his office. (See Art. xxvi.) <p>

It has also been noted above (page 561), that as long as the Church 
tolerates a bad man, a heretic in heart, a wilful sinner in any matter, 
Christian men may receive the sacraments at his hands, although they 
should, if it be possible, avoid him. <p>

Neither should be overlooked the grave sin of presenting to Holy 
Orders, or of conferring them on, those who are ignorant of the faith, 
on those who are heretical concerning it, on those who have not been 
tried and proved, on men of worldly life and conversation. To "lay 
hands hastily" on such persons is to be " partaker of other men's 
<!--
616 HOLY ORDERS. 
--><A NAME="p616"></a>
 sins" (1 Tim. v. 22). No one can dispense with the unchanging law of 
God in this or any other matter. <p>

(3) The priest's office centres in the Holy Eucharist; but this implies 
also all that is requisite in preparation for that august sacrament. 
And this means preparing men by the Word of God, by baptism, by 
sacramental penitence, by the visitation of the sick and unction of 
them, if authorized and desired, and the like, all for the consummated 
union of the believer with the Son of God in Holy Communion. <p>

But since the higher office in the Church always includes the lower, 
he is commanded to read public prayers, which the licensed reader may 
also do; he may serve at the altar as deacon, etc. In like manner, the 
bishop himself may act as priest or as deacon, because he includes 
these offices in his higher function. He may be parish priest, and be 
required as such to do, personally or by his deputies, all that is 
required of a parish priest.  <p>

(4) What has been said of the sacramental character of priest's orders 
would seem to apply to deacon's orders also, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>. 
His primary duty is to serve in the Holy Eucharist, and he is so 
instructed by the bishop at his ordination. In that nearest approach of 
heaven and earth, he delivers the everlasting Gospel to the people of 
God. The Epistle, although it also is the Word of God, is not ranked by 
the Church as being on the same exalted level. A "sub-deacon" (lay 
reader?) may be authorized to read that; but the deacon receives 
special authority with respect to the Gospel which the Church delivers 
to the faithful through him. But since the higher office includes the 
lower, the deacon may do those ministries which belong to others, and 
these accordingly are specially assigned to him by the bishop at his 
ordination. He becomes licensed lay reader, or he continues the 
function; he is catechist; he does what any Christian man may do when 
no priest can be had, <i>e.g.</i>, baptizing infants, etc. 
<!--
THE LAW. 617  
--><A NAME="p617"></a> <p>

(5) The bishop has received the power of conferring all the authority 
which he himself possesses, or a part of the same, on other men. But, 
besides this, having received jurisdiction in his diocese, he only can 
give jurisdiction to the priest for a part of that diocese. This law of 
the Catholic Church is explicitly laid down in the "Letter of 
Institution" as given in the Prayer Book: "We do by these presents give 
and grant unto you . . . our license and authority to perform the 
office of a priest in the parish of E -- . And also do hereby institute 
you into said parish, possessed of full power to perform every act of 
sacerdotal function among the people of the same, you continuing in 
communion with us, and complying with the rubrics and canons of the 
Church, and with such lawful directions as you shall at any time 
receive from us, etc." <p>

But, in like manner, the bishop himself must have jurisdiction for a 
lawful exercise of the functions of his office. He is not a bishop 
over the whole Catholic Church, but over the flock committed to his 
care by lawful authority. Therefore he cannot lawfully ordain those who 
are not subject to him, unless he have received commission to act for 
one who has jurisdiction in the case in question. <p>

But since the character conferred is indelible, while he may be acting 
unlawfully, he may be heretical, schismatic, or he may be deposed, 
still his official acts are valid; they cannot be repeated where the 
act, once validly done, is lifelong in its consequences. <p>

The case is parallel with others mentioned before, and further proof, 
if any were needed, would be found in the fact that the deposed bishop, 
if restored to the exercise of his office, cannot be consecrated anew. 
But those who receive the sacraments from this deposed bishop have no 
claim to the grace which belongs to those ordinances, because they sin 
in communing in any way with one who is cut off from the one Body of 
Christ. <p>

Such a bishop, then, may validly ordain, and his ordina<!--
618 HOLY ORDERS.  
 --><A NAME="p618"></a>tions cannot be repeated; but he can give no mission for a lawful 
performance of sacerdotal or any other ministerial functions.  <p>

(6) The exclusion of women from Holy Orders, while they may be licensed 
to exercise other and appropriate ministries in the Church, seems to 
rest on the unvarying law of the Church from the beginning.  <p>

(7) Finally, for all in Holy Orders there is that personal purity and 
holiness of life which the bishop's charge so solemnly presents. A few 
details of outward law may here be given. And, first, since men are set 
aside for God's service, they are, beside the great sacrifice of the 
altar, to be continually offering sacrifice of praise and intercession. 
The Anglican Church explicitly orders this in her preface to the Common 
Prayer: "All priests and deacons are to say daily the Morning and 
Evening Prayer, either privately or openly, not being let by sickness 
or some other urgent cause." This is not the place to try to define 
what constitutes an "urgent cause," and in practice the determination 
must be left to the individual conscience; but it is certainly to be 
observed that the obligation does not rest on duty to a parish, but is 
the personal obligation of the individual, because he has been ordained 
for this. If "he be at home and not otherwise reasonably hindered," he 
is to say his office in church in order that others may unite with him, 
if they will. But the obligation is more general, and personal in 
character. <p>

The American Church retains the daily offices and omits the law. But 
the very lowest ground on which the conscientious minister can take his 
stand surely is, that the public or private recitation of the daily 
offices, if not obligatory on the American priest and deacon, is at 
least for him a matter of grave counsel on the part of the Church. He 
is sworn to be "diligent in prayers, and in reading the Holy 
<!--
THE LAW. 619 
--><A NAME="p619"></a>
 Scripture," and the Church has given a daily order in which to fulfil 
his vow. It ought to be needless to add that this implies a devout 
attention, avoiding as far as possible even venial distractions. <p>

The priest further promises what the deacon does not -- <i>sc.</i>, to 
"lay aside the study of the world and the flesh," which must be 
understood to mean the renouncing all secular occupations so far as 
they may not prove to be of absolute necessity for the sustenance of 
life. <p>

Lawful amusements, also, may not be lawful for him, if they frequently 
give others occasion to sin, and in his case afford scandal to the 
weak. The practical application of this principle will vary too widely 
in different parts of the Church to render it possible to base precise 
laws upon it. What would give the most serious scandal in one section, 
and also permanently injure pastoral influence, will in another section 
be the very opposite of this, though equally lawful in both. Much might 
be said of the law of special holiness which binds the priests of a 
holy God. Israel's priests received it for us. "They shall be holy unto 
their God, and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of 
the Lord . . . the bread of their God, they do offer; therefore they 
shall be holy" (Lev. xxi. 6). How much rather, then, those who 
consecrate and offer, not the shadow, but the very image and sacrament 
of the everlasting sacrifice in heavenly places!<p>
