<h3>CHAPTER VI.  ON VICES AND SINS.</h3>  <p>

<h4>&sect; 1. The nature of vice and sin.</h4><p>

<i>Is vice contrary to nature?</i><p>

Vice is contrary to virtue. But the virtue of each thing consists in 
its being well disposed towards what is agreeable to its nature. And 
vice consists in the contrary disposition. But man is specifically 
distinguished by his rational soul. Therefore that which is contrary to 
the order of reason, is contrary to the nature of man, as man. But 
man's good is the living according to reason, and his evil is the 
living unreasonably. Therefore human virtue which "makes a man good, 
and his work good," is so far according to his nature, as it agrees 
with reason; but vice is so far against human nature, as it is contrary 
to the order of reason. <p>

(1) But virtues are not naturally in us, since they are produced either 
by inspiration, or by practical efforts: how, then, can vices be 
contrary to nature? I answer that it is true that perfect virtue is not 
caused by nature, but yet virtue inclines to what is according to 
nature, <i>i.e.</i>, what is according to the order of reason. So far, 
virtue is according to nature, and vice contrary to it. <p>

(2) It may be objected, also, that nothing which is contrary to nature 
is found in the majority of those who have that nature; but vices are 
found in the majority of men. But man has a two-fold nature, sensitive 
and rational. Through the operations of sense man arrives at rational 
<!--
Qu. LXXI. 4, 5.] NATURE OF VICE AND SIN. 77
--><A NAME="p77"></a>
 acts; and more follow the inclinations of the sensitive nature, than 
those who follow the order of reason, and so they fall into vices and 
sins.  <p>

<i>Can sin coexist together with virtue?</i><p>

Sin is related to virtue as a bad act to a good habit. But a habit in 
the soul does not necessarily produce its operation; but a man uses 
that habit when he wills to do so. Hence, while a habit remains in a 
man, he is able to refrain from using that habit, or he can produce an 
opposite act. So, while still having a virtue, he may proceed to the 
act of sin. And a single act does not destroy a habit, any more than it 
creates such a habit. But if we consider the causes of virtues, we 
shall see that some virtues may be corrupted by a single act. For every 
mortal sin is contrary to charity, which is the root of all the infused 
virtues as virtues. And therefore by one act of mortal sin, charity 
being excluded, all the inspired virtues are excluded also as virtues. 
Faith and hope, then, may remain in a dead condition after mortal sin, 
but they are not virtues. <p>

But venial sin, since it is not contrary to charity, excludes neither 
it nor the other virtues. <p>

But the acquired virtues are not taken away by any one act of sin. So, 
then, mortal sin cannot coexist with the infused virtues; but it can 
so exist along with the acquired virtues; but venial sin may coexist 
with both.  <p>

<i>In every sin is there some act?</i><p>

S. James answers this question (iv. 17), saying, "To him that knoweth 
to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin." Sins of omission are 
now before us. And if we consider in them that only which, <i>per 
se</i>, pertains to the idea of sin, we see that sometimes the sin of 
omission is accompanied by an inward act, as when one wills not to go 
to church, to stay away. But sometimes the sin of omission has no act 
either inward or outward, as when one, at the 
<!--
78 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXI. 5.
--><A NAME="p78"></a>
 hour in which he is bound to go to church, does not think either of 
going or of not going. <p>

But if in the sin of omission we include the causes or the occasions of 
the omission, then it is necessary that there be some act. For there is 
no sin of omission unless one pretermit what he is able to do or to 
leave undone. But our not doing that which we can do or leave undone, 
must be from some cause or occasion conjoined or preceding. And if, on 
the one hand, that cause is not in a man's power, the omission is no 
sin, as when one omits going to church on account of some (physical) 
infirmity. But if the cause or occasion of the omission is subject to 
the will, the omission is sin; and then, in every case, that cause, as 
voluntary, has some act, at least the interior act of the will. This 
act indeed is sometimes directly turned to that omission, as when one 
wills not to go to church in order to avoid the trouble of doing so. 
Then such an act, <i>per se</i>, pertains to the omission. For the 
willing of any sin pertains to that sin, since all sin is voluntary. <p>

But sometimes the act of the will is directed to something else, 
through which a man is hindered from doing what he ought. This may be 
conjoined to the omission, as when one wills to play at some game when 
be ought to go to church; or it may precede the omission, as when one 
wills to sit up late, and in consequence misses the morning service in 
church (when he ought to be there). In this case the inward act is 
<i>per accidens</i> with respect to the omission, since the latter was 
not intended. We may say, then, that some sin can exist without any 
act. <p>

Remember that more is required for good than for evil, since the good 
demands "the whole, complete cause, but evil arises from particular 
defects." Merit, therefore, cannot exist unless what one does he does 
voluntarily and as he ought. So it requires an act. The act of sin is 
not parallel with this. 
<!--
Qu. LXXII. 2.] DIVISIONS. 79  
--><A NAME="p79"></a><p>

Every sin is voluntary; and where there is no will there is no sin. But 
the not-willing is voluntary whenever it is in the power of a man to 
will or not to will. <p>

There is a seeming objection, that if this be true one sins continually 
who never does what is his due act. But this is false. <p>

I answer that we must remember that the sin of omission is against some 
affirmative precept. And such precepts do not bind continually. The 
sin, therefore, is prolonged just as long as the precept binds which is 
neglected.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Divisions.</h4><p>

(1) <i>S. Augustine's division, viz., a word, deed, or thought which is 
contrary to eternal law, rests upon most solid foundation.</i><p>

For while the primary cause of sin is in the will, yet there are 
outward acts commanded by the will which are in themselves bad and so 
are distinguished in the division. And the root of sin in aversion 
from God is pointed out in the second part of the definition, viz., sin 
is "contrary to eternal law" (<i>i.e.</i>, the Divine Reason and Will). 
According to positive law, indeed, not every sin is evil because it is 
prohibited; but some things are prohibited because they are evil. But 
according to the law of nature, which rests upon eternal law, every sin 
is an evil because it is prohibited.  <p>

(2) <i>Sins are also either spiritual or carnal.</i><p>

They take their species from their objects. But every sin consists in 
inordinate desire of some changeable good; and, consequently, when that 
good is obtained, there is inordinate pleasure. But pleasure is
 two-fold : one, spiritual, derived from the apprehension of some thing 
desired and possessed, <i>e.g.</i>, the applause of men; another, 
corporeal or natural, from which may spring carnal sins, as glut<!--
80 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXII. 4.
 --><A NAME="p80"></a>tony or lust. In sins of the latter kind there is a spiritual act. 
<i>sc.</i>, the act of reason -- but the end is corporeal pleasure.  <p>

(3) <i>Sins are also either against God, against self, or against our 
neighbor.</i><p>

Sin is an inordinate act. But there is a three-fold order to which man is 
bound to conform one, the rule of reason as the director of all our 
actions and passions; another, the rule of Divine law by which we ought 
to be directed in all things. And if man were naturally a solitary being, 
this two-fold order would suffice. But man belongs to society, and a third 
order is needed by which man may be ordained with respect to other men 
among whom he ought to live. <p>

But the second of these orders (the Divine law) contains the first, and 
exceeds it. For whatever things are contained under the order of reason 
are contained under the law of God Himself. But some things are 
contained under the latter which exceed human reason, as those things 
which are of faith, and are due to God alone. Hence, those who sin in 
such things are said to sin against God, as the heretic, the 
sacrilegious, the blasphemer. <p>

Similarly, the second order contains the third and exceeds it. For in 
all things which concern our neighbour we are to be directed by the 
rule of reason. But in some things we are directed by reason which 
concerns ourselves only, and not our neighbour. In these a man is said 
to sin against himself, as the intemperate, and the wasteful. This 
distinction is according to the objects of sins, which diversify their 
species. <p>

Observe, also, that by the theological virtues man is ordered with 
reference to God; temperance and courage are cardinal virtues directed 
towards self; but justice is towards one's neighbour. 
<!--
Qu. LXXIII. 1.] COMPARATIVE GUILT OF SINS. 81  
--><A NAME="p81"></a><p>

Do circumstances change the species of sin? <p>

Where the motive for transgression is different, there is difference in 
the sin; for the motive is the end and object. But sometimes where the 
circumstances are corrupt the motive remains the same; as the illiberal 
man from the same motive may keep when he ought not to do so, and where 
he ought not, and more than he ought, all on account of his inordinate 
desire of wealth. In such corrupt cirstances, the sin is one and the 
same. But when such corruptions spring from different motives, the 
species of sin is changed.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. On the comparative guilt of sins.</h4> <p>

<i>Are all sins necessarily involved in one another?</i><p>

The intention of him who acts virtuously in following reason is 
different from him who sins in turning away from reason. For the aim of 
the virtuous is one, <i>sc.</i>, to follow the rule of reason; and 
therefore all virtues tend towards the same end, and are connected in 
the right view of things to be done, which is prudence. (See page 65.) 
But the aim of the sinner is not to recede from what reason demands, 
but is rather towards some desirable good, from which his sin derives 
its specific character. <p>

But such goods are diverse, have no (necessary) connection, and are 
sometimes even contrary to one another. Sins therefore have no 
necessary connection. <p>

(1) But does not S. James say (c. ii. 10), "Whosoever shall keep the 
whole law, and yet stumble in one point, he is become guilty of all"? 
But he is speaking of sin, not as the turning to transitory good, but 
as aversion from the commands of Divine law. But all the commandments 
have one and the same origin, as S. James himself says. And so in every 
sin God is despised. Thus he who offends in one point is guilty of all 
because he incurs the penal guilt of contempt of God, which is one in 
all sins. 
<!--
82 ON VICES AND SINS.  [Qu. LXXIII. 3, 5.
--><A NAME="p82"></a><p>

(2) But as the love of God is the root of all virtues, is not self-love 
the root of all sins, and consequently the ground of connection, so 
that he who has one, has all? I reply that the cases are opposites; for 
the love of God draws our affections from many to one; and therefore 
the virtues which are caused by that love are connected. But self-love 
draws the affections to various and diverse ends, and therefore the 
vices and sins which are caused by it are not so connected.  <p>

<i>Sins differ in gravity according to their objects.</i> <p>

The gravity of sins differs as one sickness is more serious than 
another. For as the good of health consists in a certain proportion of 
the animal frame, its constituents, its functions, to the needs of the 
animal, so the good of virtue depends upon the proportion of human 
acts, their due relation, to the rule of reason. But the sickness is 
more  serious the further the departure from the above standard, and 
the nearer it approaches to the vital organs. Disease of the heart is 
ordinarily more dangerous than disease in the foot. So sin is more 
grave the more the disorder touches higher principles. But reason 
orders all actions with reference to the end; therefore the sin is 
greater which concerns the higher ends. And the end of the action is 
the object of the action. Thus difference in the gravity of sins 
depends on the difference in their objects. So the sin against a man is 
greater than the sin which concerns merely external things; homicide is 
more serious than theft. And still greater is the sin which is 
committed immediately against God, as infidelity or blasphemy.  <p>

<i>Spiritual sins are of greater guilt than carnal sins.</i><p>

Not that every spiritual sin is greater than any carnal sin; but, other 
things being equal, the former are of greater guilt. And this for three 
reasons. (1) Spiritual sins pertain to the spirit to which it belongs 
to be converted 
<!--
Qu. LXXIII. 6.] COMPARATIVE GUILT OF SINS. 83
--><A NAME="p83"></a>
 to God or to turn away from Him. But carnal sins are consummated in 
fleshly pleasure which chiefly turns to corporeal good. And therefore 
carnal sin (as such) is more marked by a turning towards the thing. But 
spiritual sin contains more of aversion (from God), from which comes 
the guilt, and it is therefore a greater sin. <p>

(2) Carnal sin, as such, is against one's own body, which, in the order 
of charity, is less to be loved than God and our neighbor, against whom 
spiritual sins are committed; and therefore spiritual sins, as such, 
are of greater guilt. <p>

(3) The stronger the (outward) impulse towards sin, the less is its 
guilt. But carnal sins have the stronger impulse (outwardly), from the 
inborn concupiscence of the flesh. And therefore, once more, spiritual 
sins are, as such, of greater guilt. <p>

There are apparent exceptions to this rule -- e.g., adultery is a 
graver sin than theft; but the former is not only the fleshly sin of 
lust, but the spiritual sin of injustice, and that of a graver sort 
than simple theft. <p>

And the devil is said to rejoice especially in the carnal sin of lust, 
because it cleaves most closely to a man, and is most difficult to 
escape from. Incontinent concupiscence, which is carnal, is also more 
shameful than incontinent anger, because it is irrational, and makes 
man more like the brutes.  <p>

<i>Does the gravity of sins depend upon the cause of sin?</i> <p>

The question is equivocal, because we may consider, first, what is 
<i>per se</i> the proper cause of sin, which is the will to sin. Sin is 
the fruit of that tree, and "the tree is known by its fruit." And the 
greater this cause, the greater is the sin. <p>

But other causes are extrinsic and remote, from which the will is 
inclined to sin. And we must distinguish among these. For some induce 
the will to sin, in agreement with its own nature, as, <i>e.g.</i>, the 
end, which is the 
<!--
84 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXIII. 8. 
--><A NAME="p84"></a> 
 proper object of the will. And from such a cause the sin is rendered 
greater. For he sins more gravely whose will, aiming at a worse end, is 
inclined to sin. But there are other causes which incline the will to 
sin, against the nature and order of the will itself, which is 
naturally made to move freely by its own direction according to the 
reason. Hence causes which diminish the judgment of reason -- 
<i>e.g.</i>, ignorance -- or which diminish the free action of will, as 
infirmity, or violence, or fear, in diminishing the voluntary, diminish 
also the sin. And if the act be altogether involuntary, it is not a 
sinful act. <p>

It may be said that the greater the concupiscence, the less is the sin, 
and therefore the greatness of the cause makes the sin so much the 
less. But if we include in concupiscence the motion of the will itself, 
then, where there is greater concupiscence, there is greater sin. But 
if by concupiscence we mean a passion of our lower nature, then greater 
concupiscence, if it precede the judgment of the reason and the motion 
of the will, diminishes the sin; because he who sins under the 
influence of greater passion, falls through greater temptation, and 
less is imputed to him. But if concupiscence, so understood, follows 
the judgment of the reason and the motion of the will, then, where 
there is greater concupiscence, there is greater sin. For sometimes 
this stronger passion rises because the unbridled will is tending to 
its desired object.  <p>

<i>Is sin greater as the injury done is greater?</i><p>

The injury has one of three relations to the sin. (1) It is foreseen 
and intended, as a malicious homicide or theft. And then the quantity 
of injury directly increases the gravity of the sin, because injury is 
<i>per se</i> the object of the sin. <p>

(2) Sometimes, again, it is foreseen, but not intended, as when one, 
passing through a field in order to commit a crime, knowingly does harm 
to the growing crop, but not with the intention of doing harm. Then, 
also, the quan<!--
Qu. LXXIII. 8.] COMPARATIVE GUILT OF SINS. 85 
 --><A NAME="p85"></a>tity of injury aggravates the sin, but indirectly; inasmuch as it 
proceeds from a will inclined to sin, that he does not avoid doing harm 
either to himself or another, which, simply, he would not have willed 
to do. <p>

(3) But sometimes the injury is neither foreseen nor intended, and if 
it is accidental with respect to the sin, it does not directly 
aggravate the sin. But, on account of negligence in not considering the 
injury which might happen, the evils which happen unintentionally incur 
a penalty if a man was engaged in an unlawful act. (Op. Common law.) <p>

(4) But if the injury <i>per se</i> follow from the act of sin, though 
it be neither intended nor foreseen, it directly aggravates the sin; 
because whatsoever <i>per se</i> follows from sin pertains in a certain 
way to the sin itself; <i>e.g.</i>, if scandal follow from the sin, 
though not sought for nor clearly foreseen, the sin is directly 
aggravated by this. But because sin is aggravated by the injury done, 
it does not follow that this is the only aggravating condition. For sin 
<i>per se</i> is greater as it is more inordinate. And the injury 
itself aggravates the sin so far as it makes the act more inordinate. 
So it does not follow that if sins against our neighbor do most harm, 
they are therefore the worst of sins. There is greater disorder in sins 
against God, and in some of those which are against one's self. <p>

It may be said, also, that although no injury can be directly done to 
God, it may be attempted against those things which are especially 
related to God, as the attempt to exterminate the faith, to profane 
what is holy, which are gravest sins. <p>

It is said, also, that no one willingly injures himself, and that this 
shows that consequences do not aggravate sin, for some of the gravest 
sins -- e.g., suicide -- are against one's self. But this is only true 
<i>secundum quid</i>, for the suicide knowingly and willingly does harm 
to himself, though he is seeking as his end some apparent good.  
<!--
86 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXIV. 1, 2.  
--><A NAME="p86"></a> <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. The subject of sin.</h4><p>

<i>Is the will the subject of sin?</i><p>

There are acts which do not, like sawing wood, pass over to exterior 
matter, but remain in the agent of them, as desiring and knowing. Moral 
acts, whether of virtue or vice, are of this latter class. So, then, 
the proper subject of the sinful act is the power which is the 
principle of activity. And since it is characteristic of moral acts 
that they are voluntary, it follows that the will, which is the source 
of voluntary acts, is the seat of sin. <p>

It might be objected, (1) that evil is always against will and 
intention. And that is true, if it be regarded as evil. But some evil 
is apparent good, and sin is so regarded, and is voluntary. <p>

(2) But, again, does not this regarding evil as good seem to be rather 
defect of understanding than defect of will? I answer that if the 
defect of knowledge were not subject to our will, there would be no sin 
either in will or judgment. This is true of those who labor under 
invincible ignorance. But, otherwise, this defect of understanding is 
sin.  <p>

<i>Is the will alone the subject of sin?</i><p>

Voluntary acts, as we have seen (see page 10), are not only those which 
are elicited from the will, but those which are commanded by the will, 
and which other powers execute. Hence all those powers which can be 
moved to their acts by the will, or restrained from those acts by the 
will, can be the subject of sin. And these same powers also are the 
subject of moral habits, good or bad. Will, then, is the cause of sin, 
not the only subject of it. <p>

The members of the body arc not a parallel case. For they are merely 
the organs of activity, and are in no sense free. Therefore there is no 
moral transgression in them. 
<!--
Qu. LXXIV. 3.] THE SUBJECT OF SIN. 87<p>
--><A NAME="p87"></a><p>

<i>There may be sin in sense-appetite.</i><p>

For there may be sin in any power of the soul whose act is voluntary 
and inordinate. Among such acts are those of sense-appetite; therefore 
there can be sin in them. <p>

(1) But is not this sensuous nature common to us and the brutes? 
Whereas sin is peculiar to man, who alone is praised or blamed for his 
acts. So it seems that there can be no sin in it. The answer to this is 
easy. Our sensuous nature is joined to reason and fitted to obey 
reason. Thus the acts of our sense-appetite may be voluntary, and the 
subject of sin. <p>

(2) Again, it may be said that no one sins in what he cannot avoid; but 
we cannot avoid the inordinate acts of sensuality as long as we live 
this mortal life. I answer that it is true that the perpetual 
corruption of our sense-nature, our birth-sin, is never totally taken 
away in this life. But such <i>corruptio fomitis</i> does not prevent 
man from repressing by reasonable will each inordinate motion of 
sensuality as it arises, say, by diverting his thoughts into another 
channel. But while one is doing this, some inordinate motion may arise 
from this new source. Thus when one, wishing to avoid the inordinate 
motions of concupiscence, turns his thoughts to science, some 
unpremeditated thought of vainglory may arise in his soul; and so man 
cannot avoid motions of this kind, on account of this innate 
corruption. But the idea of voluntary sin in this connection implies 
that we can shun the separate motions as they present themselves. <p>

(3) There is indeed no deliberate action in these cases, and what a man 
does without rational deliberation is not perfectly his act. 
Consequently it cannot be a perfect act of virtue or of vice. Hence, 
such motions of sensuality, anticipating reason, may be venial sin, as 
sin (in a certain way) imperfect. 
<!--
88 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. Lxxiv. 4, 5.  
--><A NAME="p88"></a><p>

<i>Can there he mortal sin in our sense-nature?</i><p>

Disorder which corrupts the principle of spiritual life, the ultimate 
end, causes the spiritual death of mortal sin. But to ordain anything 
for its end does not belong to sensuality, but to the reason alone. To 
it, therefore, alone belongs inordination with respect to the end. 
Hence, mortal sin is not attributed to the lower nature, but is only in 
the higher. <p>

(1) We may sin mortally with reference to sensuous objects, because the 
sensuous act can concur in that sin. But the sin is not mortal because 
it belongs to sense-appetite, but because it is a rational act, and it 
is reason's office to order man with reference to the end which he aims 
at. <p>

(2) Again, there are virtues of the irrational nature, such as 
temperance and fortitude; but the act of virtue is perfected by reason 
and will which has power to choose; for the act of virtue requires 
choice. Hence, with the virtue of the desires, of the passions, is 
joined (if they are completely virtuous acts) the act of prudence, 
which perfects our rational nature. So is it, also, in mortal sin. <p>

(3) The venial sin which may exist in the sensuous nature, is a 
disposition for mortal sin which belongs to the rational nature only. <p>

<i>Can there be sin in the reason?</i><p>

Yes; and that in two ways. For reason's office is twofold: first, to 
know its proper object, which is any truth; next, to direct the other 
powers of the soul. In both respects there can be sin in reason. First, 
as it errs concerning the truth, when it can know and is bound to know 
that truth; next, when it either commands the inordinate acts of the 
lower nature, or deliberately neglects to cheek them. <p>

(1) The objector may ask, Is not error due to defect in reason, to 
ignorance, which is an excuse for wrong rather than a sin? And this 
objection stands, if we speak of involuntary ignorance. A madman is not 
responsible for 
<!--
Qu. LXXIV. 6, 7, 8.] THE SUBJECT OF SIN. 89 
--><A NAME="p89"></a> 
 his acts. But ignorance of that which one can know and ought to know, 
is itself a sin. But reason's defect in directing the other powers of 
the soul is always imputed to it as a sin. <p>

<i>Is voluntary pleasure in the thought of sin, "morose delectation," a 
sin of reason?</i> <p>

Reason can direct not only outward acts, but also inward Passions. And 
when it fails to do so, there is sin in it. But there are two kinds of 
sin in this inward government; one, when a man deliberately excites in 
himself the (inordinate) passion of anger or concupiscence (or whatever 
the passion may be); another, when he does not repress the illicit 
motion of passion. He perceives that the thought is inordinate, but yet 
he allows it to remain, does not expel it. So, the sin of morose 
delectation is in the reason (though not in that alone). I am not 
speaking of the mere length of time that the evil thought remains in 
the mind, but of the deliberate failure to repress the thought of evil, 
in which the desires of the soul find pleasure. <p>

<i>The supreme judgment and final consent to the act of sin, which 
inwardly consummates that sin, is in the higher reason alone which 
turns away from the eternal law of God.</i> <p>

Consent to the pleasure of that sin is only a preamble to that final 
judgment, and is a lower act of reason. <p>

<i>Consent to pleasure in the thought of sinful acts is itself a sin 
when it means that the affections are voluntarily inclined to those 
acts.</i> <p>

For one takes pleasure only in that which is conformed to his spiritual 
or bodily state. But that one deliberately choose such conformity of 
his disposition to mortal sins, is itself a mortal sin.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> 
<!--
90 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXV. 1.  
--><A NAME="p90"></a><p>

<h4>&sect; 5. The causes of sins.</h4><p>

<i>How can sin have a cause?</i><p>

Sin is any inordinate act. As act, then, it must have a cause, like any 
other act. But as inordinate, it has a cause as negation or privation 
is caused. But a cause of a negation may be assigned in two ways: 
first, the absence of the productive cause is a cause of the negation 
as such. For on removing of the cause follows removing of the effect; 
as the absence of the sun is the cause of darkness. But, in another 
way, that cause which produces a certain result is the cause <i>per 
accidens</i> of some negation -- <i>i.e.</i>, of the absence of 
something else which is inconsistent with that result which actually 
follows from the acting cause. Thus, if cold be considered as a 
positive thing, the fire is the cause <i>per accidens</i> of its 
absence. <p>

But since the inordination of sin and every evil whatsoever are not 
mere negations, but privations of that which a thing is fitted for and 
ought to have, such inordination must have an efficient cause <i>per 
accidens</i>. For that which anything naturally has and ought to have 
will never be absent except through some impeding cause. And thus it is 
correctly said that the evil which consists in any privation has a 
<i>"causa deficiens,"</i> or an efficient cause <i>per accidens</i>. 
But this carries us back to an efficient cause <i>per se</i>. <p>

Since, then, sin on the part of the inordination has an efficient cause 
<i>per accidens</i>, but, on the part of the act done it has an 
efficient cause <i>per se</i>, it follows that the inordination of the 
sin results from the cause itself of the act.  
<!--
Qu. LXXV. 2, 3.] THE CAUSES OF SINS. 91  
--><A NAME="p91"></a><p>

And our conclusion is that the will which is not directed by the rule 
of reason and the Divine law, in aiming at some transitory good, causes 
the act of sin <i>per se</i>, but the inordination of the act <i>per 
accidens</i>, and apart from the intention; for the lack of order in 
the act results from lack of direction in the will. <p>

We find a cause of sin, therefore, because sin is not only privation, 
but an act in which that privation is found. <p>

And causality does not here imply necessity of sin, for necessary 
causality means a sufficient cause with no hindering cause. And sin as 
caused, is not necessary effect, because the result can be hindered. 
One might ask whether good or evil is the cause of sin, and say that 
good cannot be such a cause, and evil is the very sin itself which is 
in question. But I reply that ungoverned will is the cause of sin, and 
the cause is good, along with the absence of another good.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup>  <p>

<i>We may find four inward causes of sin, and sometimes all four 
concur.</i><p>

First, the senses or the imagination, which present something 
pleasurable to the soul; next, desire, which is inclined to it as 
pleasurable; next, reason, which approves of it without reference to 
the due rule and law; lastly, the will, which consents and perfects the 
act of sin.  <p>

<i>Has sin an outward cause?</i><p>

Such outward cause, if it exist, might be the cause of sin in either of 
three ways; either by directly moving the will itself, or by acting on 
the reason, or by moving sense-appetite (the senses, the imagination, 
or the desires). <p>

But God only, who cannot be the cause of sin, can directly move the 
will. Nothing outward, then, can be the cause 
<!--
ON VICES AND SINS. [QU LXXVI. 1. 
--><A NAME="p1"></a>
 of sin, unless it move the reason by persuasion, or unless it move the 
sensual desires, as some outward sensible things upon those desires. 
But when anything is to be done, persuasion does not move the reason by 
force of necessity. nor do outward things necessarily move the desires 
except certain abnormal conditions of the soul (when one is not 
responsible for his acts). Desire, also, does not of necessity move 
reason and will. Hence an outward cause may contribute to the sinful 
act, but is not an adequate cause. That adequate cause is the will only.
  
<h4>&sect; 6. Relations of ignorance to sin.</h4><p>

Is ignorance ever the cause of 
sin? A cause may be such <i>per accidens</i>, by removing what hinders the 
result (as a flaw in a casting may be, <i>per accidens</i>, the cause of the 
wreck of a steamer). In this way ignorance may be the cause of the sinful 
act, for it is a privation of that knowledge which perfects reason as 
director of human actions and capable of prohibiting the act of sin. But 
reason directs human acts through two-fold knowledge, one general, the 
other particular (knowledge of the law, and knowledge of the fact). For 
when one conders what he shall do, he has a sort of syllogism in his 
mind; and his conclusion is his judgment, choice, or operation. And his 
particular decision is brought under some general rule or law by some 
particular proposition. Thus a man is prevented from the act of parricide 
by knowing that fathers are not to be killed, and by knowing that this 
man is his father. Therefore ignorance of the law or ignorance of the 
fact may cause the act of parricide. Hence it evident that not all 
ignorance on the part of the sinner the cause of his sin, but only that 
which prevents the knowledge which would have prohibited the act of sin 
(antecedent ignorance is cause of the outward act; consequent ignorance, 
of its sinfulness). Hence if the will of any one 
<!--
Qu. LXXVI. 2.] RELATIONS OF IGNORANCE TO SIN. 93 
--><A NAME="p93"></a>
 is so disposed that he would not be hindered from the act of parricide 
by knowing that the man is his father, his ignorance of his father 
(concomitant ignorance) is not the cause of his sin. He does not sin 
through ignorance, but he sins in ignorance. (Nic. Eth., iii. 1.) <p>

(1) Ignorance may be purely a negative; but negatives may be causes 
<i>per accidens</i>, in removing what hinders a result. <p>

(2) It is true, also, that every sin is in a bad will, and that a thing 
must be apprehended and not unknown, in order that it may be willed. 
But that which is willed may be partly known and partly unknown. Thus 
one may know that the being whom he kills is a man, without knowing 
that it is his father.  <p>

<i>Is ignorance a sin?</i><p>

Distinguish ignorance from nescience. The latter is simply negative, 
the simple negation of knowledge. <p>

But ignorance is privative, privation of knowledge of those things 
which one is fitted to possess. But some of these things every one is 
bound to know; <i>sc.</i>, those things without which it is impossible 
to perform rightly the acts which are due from us. Hence all are bound 
to know the first principles of the faith and of the law of nature; and 
individuals are bound to know those things which belong to their state 
or office. But there are other things which we are fitted to know, 
which we are not in general bound to know, as the theorems of geometry. <p>

But it is manifest that whosoever neglects to possess or to do what he 
is bound to have or to do, is guilty of a sin of omission. Ignorance, 
therefore, of those things which one is bound to know, if it be due to 
negligence ("consequent ignorance"), is a sin. But negligence is not 
imputed to a man who does not know what he cannot know. This ignorance 
is called invincible, that which cannot be overcome by due inquiry. 
Such ignorance, not being in our power, 
<!--
ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXVI. 2, 8. 
--><A NAME="p2"></a>
 is involuntary and is not sin. But vincible ignorance is sin, if it 
concern those things which one is bound to know.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

(1) This is not inconsistent with our definition of sin, as "a word, 
deed, or thought opposed to God's law," for the opposite negations are 
included in the definition, so far as omission has the nature of sin. 
And so negligence which makes ignorance to be sin, is included as a 
(wilful) passing by of what ought to be said, done, or thought, in 
order to acquire due knowledge. <p>

(2) Sin is more directly opposed to grace than to ignorance. But 
privation of grace is rather a penalty following on sin than itself a 
sin. Why, then, is privation of knowledge a sin, and not privation of 
grace? To this I reply that negligence, also, in preparing one's self 
for the reception of that grace, may itself be a sin. And yet even 
herein there is a difference; since man can acquire the knowledge now 
spoken of by his own acts, but grace is purely the gift of God. <p>

(3) Again, it may be objected that sin is taken away by penitence, but 
ignorance is not so removed, and therefore it cannot be sin. But 
observe that the negligence does not remain after penitence, and so 
what makes ignorance to be a sin is removed. <p>

(4) Though the sinful ignorance constantly continues in the sinner, he 
does not continually sin, but, as in other sins of omission, only at 
that time when the affirmative precept is obligatory; <i>sc.</i>, when 
there is fit opportunity to acquire that knowledge which he is bound to 
possess.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup>  <p>

<i>Does ignorance totally excuse from sin?</i><p>

Ignorance in itself renders the act which it causes an 
<!--
Qu. LXXVI. 3.] MORAL RELATIONS OF IGNORANCE. 95 
--><A NAME="p95"></a>
 involuntary act. But ignorance is said to cause that act which would 
be prohibited by the corresponding knowledge. Such an act would be 
contrary to the will if knowledge were present; <i>i.e.</i>, it would 
be involuntary. <p>

But if that knowledge would not prevent the act from being done, 
because of the will's inclination to it, ignorance of this knowledge 
does not make a man to act involuntarily, but he acts, not willing the 
result. (Note the distinction between unwilling, and not-willing.) 
(Nic. Eth., iii. 1.) Such ignorance which is not the cause of the 
sinful act, not causing the involuntary, does not excuse from sin. The 
same is true of any ignorance which does not cause the sinful act, but 
is consequent upon or concomitant with the sinful act, But ignorance 
antecedent to the act of will, since it causes the act, produces an 
involuntary act, and does excuse from sin. <p>

And yet sometimes that ignorance which is the cause of the sin does not 
totally excuse it, for two reasons. First, on the part of the thing 
which is unknown. For ignorance so far excuses from sin, as one does 
not know the action to be sin. But it may happen that one is ignorant 
of some circumstance which, if known, would prevent his doing the 
sinful act, and yet he knows that he is doing wrong. He may do bodily 
injury to some one, knowing that he is injuring a man, and yet not know 
that that man is his father, which is a circumstance constituting a new 
species of sin. Or perhaps he does not know that, striking another, he 
will be struck back, which knowledge might hinder his doing so. And 
although such a one sins on account of ignorance, yet he is not totally 
excused from sin, because he knows that he is doing wrong. Again, the 
ignorance itself may be voluntary, either directly, as when one does 
not wish to know, in order that he may be more free in sin; or 
indirectly, as when one, on account of the labor required, or other 
occupations, neglects to learn that which would keep him back from sin. 
Such negligence makes the ignorance 
<!--
ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXVI. 4. 
--><A NAME="p4"></a> 
 voluntary and a sin, if it is of those things which one can know and 
is bound to know. Such ignorance, therefore, does not totally excuse 
from sin. But if there be ignorance altogether involuntary, either 
because it is invincible, or because it is of that which one is not 
bound to know, such ignorance altogether excuses from sin.  <p>

<i>Does ignorance diminish sin?</i><p>

Since every sin is voluntary, so far as ignorance diminishes the 
voluntary, so far it diminishes sin. But it is manifest that the 
ignorance which totally takes away the voluntary, and so takes away the 
sin, does not diminish, but annuls it. But the ignorance which is not 
the cause of the sin, but concomitant with it, neither diminishes nor 
augments the sin. Therefore only that ignorance can diminish the sin, 
which is the cause of it, and yet does not totally excuse it. But 
sometimes it happens that such ignorance is directly and <i>per se</i> 
voluntary (consequent ignorance), as when one wilfully is ignorant in 
order that he may more freely sin. And such wilful ignorance (<i>"ign. 
affectata"</i>) seems to increase the voluntary, and the sin. <p>

But sometimes the ignorance which is the cause of sin is not directly 
voluntary, but only indirectly; as when one is too lazy to study, and 
so is ignorant; or he wishes to drink wine immoderately, and so loses 
sober judgment. Such ignorance may diminish the voluntary and the sin. 
For when anything is not known to be sin, it is not directly chosen as 
sin. Hence the contempt of Divine law is less, and consequently the sin 
is less. So S. Paul says (1 Tim. i. 13), "I obtained mercy because I 
did it ignorantly." <p>

It is true that every sinner is ignorant, but his ignorance is not the 
cause of his sin, but it is something consequent to the proper cause, 
which is a passion or habit inclining to sin. 
<!--
Qu. LXXVII. 1, 2.] MORAL RELATIONS OF SENSE-APPETITE. 97 
--><A NAME="p97"></a><p>

<h4>&sect; 7. The moral relations of sense-appetite to sin.</h4> <p>

<i>Is the will moved by the passions?</i><p>

Passion cannot directly draw the will after it, but it can do so 
indirectly in two ways: first, by what we may call abstraction. I mean 
that since the soul is one agent (and of limited power), when it acts 
in any one direction, its power in other directions is reduced, or even 
totally annulled. In other words, the operations of the soul require a 
certain energy, which, if it be vehemently applied to one object, 
cannot at the same time be applied to another. And in this way, when 
the motion of sensuous appetite is strengthened through some passion 
(this is so far an abstraction of mental strength), of necessity the 
strength of rational appetite, <i>i.e.</i>, of the will, is diminished 
or totally impeded. <p>

Secondly, the same result is produced on the side of the object of the 
will, which is the good apprehended by reason. For the judgment and 
apprehension of reason are impeded through the vehement and inordinate 
act of the imagination and that animal power of apprehension which we 
share with the brutes (<i>vis aestimativa</i>). We see this in many 
insane persons. But this apprehension and judgment follow the passions, 
just as the judgment in taste follows the condition of the nerves of 
the tongue. hence we see that men who are moved by any passion do not 
easily turn their imagination from the things which so affect them. 
Consequently the rational judgment, and then the motion of the will 
which is naturally adapted to follow that judgment, follow the impulse 
of the passions.  <p>

<i>Can reason be overcome by passion, against its knowledge?</i> <p>

That is, is it possible for a man overcome by passion to do what he 
knows is forbidden, while he knows this? Socrates thought that 
knowledge could never be overcome 
<!--
ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXVII. 2. 
--><A NAME="p2"></a> 
 by passion, and hence he assumed that all virtues were (habits of) 
knowledge, and all sins resulted from ignorance. And this, in a certain 
way, is true; because, since we always will the good or the apparent 
good, the will is never moved to evil as evil, but only as an apparent 
good. Ignorance or error of reason accompanies all transgression. <p>

But experience also shows that many act contrary to their own 
knowledge. "That servant which knew his lord's will, and made not 
ready, nor did according to his will, shall be beaten with many 
stripes" (S. Luke xii. 47). "To him that knoweth to do good, and doeth 
it not, to him it is sin" (S. James iv. 17). We must therefore make a 
distinction. (The. Eth., vii. 3.) For since man is directed in right 
conduct by a two-fold knowledge, defect in either suffices to hinder 
rectitude of will and act (p. 92). <p>

(1) Sometimes it happens that a man has knowledge of the universal law, 
but yet does not know in particular, that his desired act comes under 
the law. This will suffice to prevent his will from following the 
principle which he clearly knows. <p>

(2) Again, it is to be considered that nothing prevents a thing from 
being habitually known, which is not actually taken into consideration. 
It may happen therefore that a man knows the principle of conduct and 
has correct knowledge of his individual act, and yet does not actually 
consider, and so he may act against his knowledge. <p>

But that a man does not consider in the particular case what he 
habitually knows, may result (a) from defect of intention alone; as 
when he is familiar with the principles of geometry, but has no 
intention of considering the conclusions of the science, which he can 
do at once if he chooses so to do (b) but sometimes a man does not 
consider what he habitually knows, on account of some supervening 
impediment, say, on account of some other occupation, or of some bodily 
infirmity. And in this mode, he 
<!--
Qu. LXXVII. 2, 3.] MORAL RELATIONS OF SENSE-APPETITE. 99
--><A NAME="p99"></a>
 who is under the strong influence of some passion does not consider in 
the particular question before him what he knows in its principle. And 
passion may impede his consideration, first, by what we have previously 
called a kind of abstraction; next, by opposition, since passion 
generally inclines to the opposite of what is known in its principle 
and lastly, through the bodily effect produced by passion, which may 
prevent reason from freely exerting its proper influence. So sleep and 
intoxication through the body enchain the mind. Certainly this may 
happen also through intensity of passion, which may be so strong as to 
render a man totally deprived of reason, and (for the time at least) 
insane. <p>

(1) It may seem as if the stronger were overcome by the weaker, since 
the certitude of knowledge is the most fixed of our mental possessions. 
But it must be remembered that general principles which are so fixed, 
are not chief in action which concerns particulars, individual things. 
It is not so strange, therefore, that passion should act against 
knowledge of principles, when consideration of the particular 
application of those principles is lacking. <p>

(2) It is passion which makes some thing appear good to reason, which 
is not so, and thus the special judgment is against reason's general 
knowledge. <p>

(3) It is true that one cannot have two contrary opinions at once. But 
he can have one habitual principle while its opposite is immediately 
before his mind. <p>

(4) Speaking logically, he may subsume his particular judgment, under 
another universal (say, that pleasure is to be sought for) instead of 
the one which lie habitually possesses. <p>

<i>Sins of passions are rightly called sins of infirmity.</i> <p>

For as the body is infirm when any of its operations are enfeebled or 
hindered by the disorder of any of its organs, so the soul may be 
impeded by the disorder of any of its 
<!--
100 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXVII. 4, 6. 
--><A NAME="p100"></a>
 powers. And as the parts of the body are said to be disordered when 
they do not follow the order of nature, so we speak of an inordinate 
condition of the soul, when reason is not supreme. Sins of infirmity, 
then, are found when the passions affect the sensuous soul, contrary to 
the order of reason.  <p>

<i>Inordinate self-love is the cause of all sin.</i><p>

For the proper and <i>per se</i> cause of sin is the turning of the 
soul to transitory good. This comes from some inordinate desire. But 
this inordinate desire has its origin in inordinate self-love. <p>

Such inordinate desires are distinguished by the apostle as "the lust 
of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life" (1 Ep. S. 
John ii. 16).  <p>

<i>Do passions diminish the gravity of sins?</i><p>

Sin consists essentially in the act of free choice, which proceeds from 
the reason and the will. But passions, the notions of sense-appetite, 
can either precede or follow this tree choice. Antecedently, the 
passion may incline the reason and the will. But, on the other hand, 
subsequently, the intensity of our will may draw after it the passions. <p>

Now in the first case the passion which precedes the act of sin 
diminishes its gravity. For the act is so far sin as it is voluntary, 
and in our own power. And the less our act proceeds from the impulse of 
passion, the more fully voluntary it is. Passion, then, diminishes sin 
so far as it diminishes the voluntary nature of our act. <p>

But it is the opposite with consequent passion, which is a sign of the 
greatness of the sin, because it shows the intensity of the will in 
sinning. <p>

(1) More intense passion does not make greater sin, beause the passion 
is the cause of the sin on the side of sin's turning to seeming good. 
But the gravity of sin, on the other hand, depends upon the soul's 
turning away from God or, the intensity of the will in such turning 
away. 
<!--
Qu. LXXVII. 7.] MORAL RELATIONS OF SENSE-APPETITE. 101  
--><A NAME="p101"></a><p>

(2) In like manner good sentiments following the judgment of reason, 
increase the merit of virtuous acts; but if they precede it, the man 
acts more from feeling than from reason, and Imis act is less 
meritorious on that account.  <p>

<i>Does passion totally excuse from the guilt of sin?</i><p>

Any act which is bad in itself is entirely excusable only when it is 
entirely involuntary. Passion, then, which has this effect renders the 
act excusable; otherwise, not. <p>

With respect to this consider two things (1) a thing may be in itself 
voluntary, when the will is directly turned to it; or it may be 
voluntary in its cause when that cause is willed, and the effect is not 
directly willed. Thus, to him who voluntarily intoxicates himself, his 
drunken acts are rightly imputed. <p>

(2) A thing may be voluntary directly or indirectly when 
the will could prohibit it and did not. <p>

Passions, then, may be so great as to take away totally the use of 
reason. But if the beginnings of the passion were voluntary, the 
resulting acts are voluntary in their cause, and are imputed as sin. 
Here is the voluntary intoxication of the soul. But if the cause was 
not voluntary hut natural -- say, some bodily disease depriving of 
reason -- then the act is strictly involuntary, and is no sin. <p>

But often thme passion is such as does not intercept totally the use of 
reason, and then the passion can be excluded by our turning to other 
thoughts, or by our impeding its results. Such passion does not 
entirely excuse from sin. <p>

(1) But does not S. Paul say (Gal. v. 17), "The flesh lusteth against 
the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh for these are contrary the 
one to time other; so that ye may not do the things that ye would"? 
And, if so, does not passion totally excuse sin? I answer that the 
impossibility spoken of does not refer to the outward act, but to the 
inward motion of concupiscence, from which the Christian would gladly 
be free. So S. Paul says (Rom. vii. 19), 
<!--
102 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. Lxxvii. 8. 
--><A NAME="p102"></a> 
 "The evil which I would not, that I do." It is true, also, that the 
will through passion acts against its own preceding purpose. <p>

(2) But if passion causes ignorance in the particular case in question, 
why is it not a complete excuse for sin? I reply that the excusing 
ignorance is that (invincible) ignorance of the circumstances of the 
case which cannot be surmounted by any diligence. But passion causes 
ignorance of the law in its special application, by hindering one from 
applying his knowledge of the law to his particular case, which passion 
reason can repel. <p>

(3) Bodily infirmity may be a total excuse, since it is involuntary, as 
in the insane.  <p>

<i>Sins of passion may be mortal sins.</i><p>

Mortal sin consists in aversion from God, man's ultimate end. This 
aversion belongs to deliberative reason, whose office it is to ordain 
man with reference to his end. The only way, therefore, in which it can 
happen that the inclination of the soul to what is contrary to its 
ultimate end may not be mortal sin, is that deliberative reason has no 
share in that inclination. This happens in the sudden motions of 
passion. <p>

But when any one proceeds from this to the act of sin, or to deliberate 
consent, this is not a sudden action. And dehiberate reason can 
exclude, or, at least, impede, the passion. If it does not, the sin is 
mortal. So we see that many murders and many adulteries are committed 
through passion. <p>

(1) But is not sin of infirmity venial? And are not sins of passion 
sins of infirmity? But observe that venial is used in three different 
senses: (a) When the sin has some cause of pardon which diminishes the 
sin; and so sin of infirmity or of ignorance is called venial in that 
sense. (b) Again, all sin becomes venial -- <i>i.e.</i>, obtains pardon 
-- through repentance. (c) There are certain sins which are 
<!--
Qu. LXXVIII. 1.] SINS OF MALICE. 103 
--><A NAME="p103"></a>
 venial in their nature, as an idle word; and only in this sense is 
venial opposed to mortal. The objection is based on the first meaning 
of the word venial. <p>

(2) Observe, again, that passion is the cause of the sin, on the side 
of the turning to transitory good; but what makes it mortal, is the 
turning away from God. And so, though in the sensuous nature cannot be 
mortal sin, yet the sin proceeding from passion may become such.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 8. Sins of malice, <i>i.e.</i>, of deliberate 
wickedness.</h4><p>

<i>When does any one sin from malice, i.e., from deliberate 
wickedness?</i><p>

Man naturally desires the good. Hence, if his desire decline to evil, it 
is because of some corruption or some inordination in him. But the 
principles of human action are intellect and sensuous or rational 
desire, which latter is called will. Some sin, therefore, results from 
defect in the intelligence, as when one sins through ignorance. Sin 
also results from defect in sensuous desire; these are sums of 
passion. And, lastly, sin results from inordinate will. But the will is 
disordered when the less good is more loved than the greater good; 
when, consequently, any one chooses to suffer loss respecting the good 
which is less loved, in order to obtain what is preferred. So a man may 
deliberately consent to have his leg cut off, in order to preserve his 
life, which he values more. In this way, when any one inordinately 
loves some temporal good, as riches or pleasure, more than the order of 
reason or of Divine law -- <i>i.e.</i>, more than the love of God -- it 
follows that he may be willing to suffer the loss of some spiritual 
good in order to get the other, the temporal good. And since evil is 
nothing else than privation of some good, it follows that he is 
consciously willing some spiritual evil for the sake of earthly good. 
Such a one sins from fixed malice or deliberate purpose, since he 
consciously chooses the evil.
<!--
104 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXVIII. 2.  
--><A NAME="p104"></a><p>

(1) Is there any ignorance in such sin? Sometimes one is ignorant that 
the thing which he is doing is wrong in general; his is a sin of 
ignorance. Sometimes the sinner does not know that the particular act 
which he is then doing is wrong; as when be sins from passion. But 
sometimes there is no thought that the evil is not to be chosen in 
order to gain the desired good; though he knows that it is simply evil. 
This is the ignorance of malicious wickedness. <p>

(2) Evil cannot be, as such, aimed at by any one. But yet it may be 
aimed at in order to avoid some other evil, or to attain some good; and 
in such a case the sinner would choose to attain the good for which he 
seeks, even with loss of the other. So a lascivious person would prefer 
to enjoy his pleasure without offending God; but if the two 
alternatives are presented, he wills to incur the displeasure of God by 
sinning, rather than to he deprived of his pleasure. <p>

<i>Does every one who sins from habit sin from malicious 
wickedness?</i> <p>

Note that it is not the same thing to sin while possessing a habit, and 
to sin from the habit. For it is not necessary that the habit shall be 
constantly used. It is used when we will; and, therefore, as it can 
happen that one having a vicious habit does some virtuous act, because 
his reason is not totally corrupted hy his habit, so it may happen also 
that instead of acting from his vicious habit, he sins from passion or 
even from ignorance. But when soever he uses his vicious habit, he must 
sin from malice, because, when any one has a habit, that is chosen 
which is agreeable to it, the habit becomes a second nature, and 
certain things are now "connatural." But this thing which is agreeable 
to the vicious habit, excludes spiritual good; and so spiritual evil is 
chosen in order to get what habit makes to appear good. This is sinning 
from malicious wickedness. <p>

There are habits of venial sins, indeed; but since these
<!--
Qu. LXXVIII. 8, 4.] SINS OF MALICE. 105
--><A NAME="p105"></a>
 do not exclude the love of God, say, the habit of using idle words, 
they are vicious habits <i>secundum quid</i>, but not simply such. <p>

What shall we say of the remorse of habitual sinners? He who sins from 
habit always rejoices in his act while he is using his habit. But he is 
able also not to use it, and may be sorrowful when his reason, as yet 
not totally corrupted, is dictating some other thing. He grieves at 
what he has done through sinful habit, not in general, because the sin 
is in itself displeasing to him, hut because of some unpleasant result. <p>

<i>But one may sin from malice who is not sinning from vicious 
habit,</i><p>

some hindrance being removed which has prevented his inordinate soul 
from acting out its choice and forming a vicious habit. <p>

<i>Sins of malicious wickedness are graver than sins of passion.</i><p>

There are three reasons why this is true (1) Since sin is primarily in 
the will, the more the will is concerned in it, the greater, other 
things being equal, is the sin. In malice the motion to the sin is more 
purely from within, <i>i.e.</i>, from the will; whereas in sins of 
passion there is an outward impulse. Hence the more vehement the 
malice, the greater the sin; whereas, as we have seen, the more 
vehement passion diminishes the gravity of the sin. <p>

(2) The passion which inclines to sin is transient, and so a man may 
quickly return to a good purpose, but the habit by which one sins from 
malice is a permanent quality. The one is more likely to be penitent 
after sin than the other. <p>

(3) He who sins from malice is badly disposed with reference to the end 
itself. So his deficiency is more dangerous than that of him who sins 
from passion, whose 
<!--
106 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXIX. 1. 
--><A NAME="p106"></a>
 general purpose may tend to the good end, although his purpose has 
been temporarily interrupted by his passion. <p>

This malicious wickedness is in one way based on ignorance, but it is 
self-chosen ignorance, which does not palliate the sin. <p>

Both in sin of passion and of malice there is a choice of evil, but the 
first is not a sin from choice, because choice is not the primal 
principle of the sin. Something is chosen which would not have been 
chosen but for the passion. Whereas the sin of malice is a deliberate 
choice of evil, and this choice is the primal principle of the sin.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 9. External causes of sin.</h4><p>

Is God the cause of sin? (I mean, not the positive and moral act, 
which, owing to defect in it, is sin, but of the sin as sin.) Man may 
be the cause of sin in another man, either directly, by temptation, by 
inclining the will of that other to sin; or indirectly, by not doing 
one's best to withdraw another from the act of sin. But God cannot be 
directly the cause of sin in any one, because all sin is departure from 
God, the ultimate end of His creatures. But God draws all beings to 
Himself, as to their ultimate end. Neither can He be indirectly the 
cause of sin. He may not afford that aid which would, if given, hinder 
men from sinning against Him; but this is done according to the order 
of His winsdom and justice. Hence the sin of any being is not to be 
imputed to Him as the cause of it; just as the pilot is not the cause 
of the shipwreck of the steamer which he does not steer, except when he 
is able, and when it is his duty, to take charge of the vessel. <p>

(1) It is said (Rom. i. 28), "God gave them up unto a reprobate mind to 
do those things which are not fitting." But the very words show that 
those spoken of had that reprobate mind, and God did not prevent their 
following it. 
<!--
Qu. LXXIX. 2, 3.] EXTERNAL CAUSES OF SIN. 107  
--><A NAME="p107"></a><p>

(2) But it is, also, a familiar objection, that God is the author of 
freedom of the will, which is the cause of sin; and, therefore, the 
author of the cause is the originator of the effect, which proceeds 
from that cause. And this is true when the mediate cause is subjected 
to the ordering of the primal cause; but if that mediate cause violates 
the order in which it is made to act, the result is not imputable to 
the first cause. If an agent does anything contrary to the express 
command of his employer, that employer is not (morally, at least) 
answerable for the consequences. He is not the cause of them.  <p>

<i>Is the act of sin from God?</i><p>

The sinful act, as act, is being and act. But every being whatsoever is 
derived from the primal Being. And every action is caused by some being 
which has active (not passive) existence. But all activity is reducible 
to the primal activity as its cause; <i>i.e.</i>, God, who is pure 
activity, is the cause of every action. <p>

But sin is being and action containing some defect, which defect is 
from the created cause, viz., free-will departing from the order of God 
the primal agent. Hence that defect is not reducible to the causality 
of God, just as a halting gait is referable to defect in the bones of 
the leg, etc., not necessarily to the motive power of nerves and 
muscles. <p>

The act of sin is a certain motion of free-will, but the will of God is 
the cause of all motions, therefore His will is the cause of the act of 
sin.  <p>

<i>Is God the cause of blindness and hardness of heart?</i><p>

These may mean two different things; first, a motion of the soul 
cleaving to evil and averse from Divine light. This is mortal sin of 
which God is not the cause. <p>

But, again (as penalty), there may be a withdrawal of Divine grace, so 
that the mind is not Divinely illuminated 
<!--
108 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXX. 1.
--><A NAME="p108"></a>
 to see rightly, and the heart of man is not softened to live rightly. 
So far God is the cause of blindness and hardness of heart. God is the 
universal cause of the enlightening of souls (S. John i. 9 "That was 
the true light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the 
world"). So the sun is the universal cause of the illumination of 
bodies. This is through necessity of nature, but God is the cause of 
spiritual light according to His will and wisdom. But the sun may find 
some impediment and leave a body dark, as when the window shutters are 
closed; and the sun is not the cause of that darkness, but its cause is 
the one who closes the shutters. The sun exercises no judgment in the 
matter, but God, according to His own judgment, withholds the light of 
His grace, where He finds some obstacle to it. Hence the cause of the 
absence of grace is not only be who puts the obstacle in its way, but 
also God according to His righteous judgment. So He is the cause of 
blindness of sight and dulness of hearing, in not perfecting the mind 
by the gift of wisdom, and of hardness of heart in not softening the 
soul through the fire of charity. <p>

<i>Is the devil directly the cause of sins committed by man?</i><p>

The proper principle of the sinful act is the human will, since all sin 
is voluntary. But God is the only Being who can directly aet upon our 
will. The will, indeed, is moved not only by this inward Divine 
influence, but also by its object. This in three ways (1) by the object 
itself which is proposed, as we say that food excites the desire of 
eating; (2) by him who proposes or offers an object of this nature (3) 
by him who persuades that the proposed object is good, because he thus 
proposes the specific object of the will, which is rational good, 
either real or apparent. In the first way, sensible things move the 
will to sin. But in the second and third ways, the devil or our 
neighbour may incite to sin, either by offering to sense or imagination 
what is desirable, or by persuading the reason. But none of these are the 
<!--
Qu. LXXX. 2, 3.] EXTERNAL CAUSES OF SIN. 109
--><A NAME="p109"></a>
 direct cause of sin, because the will is not of necessity moved
by any object except the ultimate end.<p>

<i>Can the devil offer inward temptations to sin?</i><p>

The soul has three functions, viz., feeling, knowing, willing. The 
latter cannot be directly influenced by Satan and his angels. And the 
intellect, <i>per se</i>, is moved by what illuminates it to know the 
truth, which illumination is certainly not the aim of the devil, but 
rather a blinding of the reason through imagination and sense-appetite, 
in order that it may consent to sin. Hence the whole inward operation 
of Satan seems to be on the imagination and the sense-appetite. Images 
may be presented to the phantasy, appetite may be excited to some 
passion. For corporeal nature (as we see in our own physical 
constitution) naturally is subject (within certain limits) to spiritual 
forces. It is conceivable (to say the least) that the brain should be 
acted upon by demons, whether the man is waking or sleeping. In which 
case images will be the result. Passions also result from a certain 
condition of the brain and nervous system, and it is conceivable again 
that the devil may cooperate in these, at least through the brain, etc. <p>

(1) Images, feelings, etc., are, indeed, the works of a living agent, 
and require an inward impulse; but environment also cooperates, and we 
are regarding outward temptation as the environment of the soul. <p>

There is nothing in this which contradicts the known order of nature. <p>

<i>Can the devil produce a necessity of sinning?</i><p>

S. James (iv. 7) says, "Resist the devil and he will flee from you." 
This would not be true if Satan had power to produce necessity of sin. 
For he has no direct power over the reason; and if it be free, there 
is no necessity of sinning. If there be a case where Satan takes entire 
posses<!--
110 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXXV. 1, 2. 
 --><A NAME="p110"></a>sion of a man, so that his acts are no longer free, his acts are 
not sinful. <p>

That which is apprehended by sense or imagination, whether presented by 
demons or in any other way, does not of necessity move the will if a 
man still has use of his reason. 
  
<h4>&sect; 10. The effects of sin.</h4><p>

<i>Does sin diminish the good of nature?</i><p>

We may consider (1) the first principles of human nature which 
constitute that nature, and the properties resulting from them, such as 
are often called the faculties of man (2) the very inclination to 
virtue, which is itself a good of nature; (3) the gift of original 
righteousness, which, in the first man, was conferred on the human 
race, and can be called a natural good. The first is neither taken 
away, nor diminished by sin; but the third was totally taken away 
through the sin of our first parents. But the second is diminished 
through sin. For through human acts comes a certain inclination to 
similar acts, and anything which is inclined to one of two contraries, 
has diminished inclination to the other. Hence, since sin is contrary 
to virtue, man's sin diminishes the natural good of an inclination to 
virtue.  <p>

<i>Can the whole good of nature be taken away through sin?</i><p>

We mean now the natural inclination to virtue which belongs to man as a 
rational being. Sin cannot take away man's rationality, for then he 
would be no more capable of sinning. This good of nature, then, cannot 
be totally taken away through sin. But it is diminished so far as 
hindrances are put in the way to prevent its reachng its end. So it can 
be diminished <i>ad infinitum</i>, because hindrances can be increased 
<i>ad infinitum</i>. But the root of such inclination to virtue still 
remains, since human nature remains with all its essential attributes.  <p>

There would be no remorse of conscience in the lost if
<!--
Qu. LXXXV. 8, 5.] THE EFFECTS OF SIN. 111 
--><A NAME="p111"></a>
 there were not remaining in them the natural inclination to virtue.  <p>

<i>What are the four wounds of human nature?</i><p>

Through the gift of original righteousness reason perfectly governed 
the lower powers of the soul, and reason itself was perfected by being 
subject to God. This original righteousness being taken away through 
the sin of our first parents, all the soul's powers remain deprived of 
their proper order. And this constitutes the four wounds. For there 
are, as we have seen (page 60, ff.), four powers which can be the 
subjects of virtue <i>sc.</i>, the reason, which is the seat of 
(spiritual) prudence; the will, in which is justice; the irascible 
soul, the seat of courage; and the concupiscible, in which is 
temperance. Now the reason, destitute of its due relation to truth, is 
afflicted with the wound of ignorance; the will, destitute of its due 
order with reference to the good, is wounded with malice; the irascible 
nature is wounded with infirmity, and the concupiscible nature is 
wounded with the inordinate desire of pleasure. And since the 
inclination to virtue is diminished by actual transgression, those four 
wounds result, also from other sins; the reason is dulled concerning 
what is to be done; the will hardened with respect to the good; the 
difficulty of acting rightly increases, and concupiscene burns more 
hotly.  <p>

<i>What shall we say of death, and other corporeal defects?</i><p>

<i>Per accidens</i> one thing is the cause of another if it remove 
hindrances in the way of that result. Thus he who pulls down a column 
is <i>per accidens</i> the cause of the fall of what rests upon that 
column. So the sin of our first parents is the cause of death and other 
like corporeal defects, by taking away that original righteousness by 
which not only the lower powers of the soul were subject in orderly way 
to
<!--
ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXXVII. 1. 
--><A NAME="p1"></a>
 reason, but the body was the perfect servant of a perfect soul. The 
loss of this original righteousness renders human nature corruptible in 
all its parts, even to the disorganizaion of the body itself. This is 
the penalty of the first sin, not aimed at by the sinner, but ordained 
by the punitive justice of God. Considered in itself, the animal body 
is corruptible, but God (by special gift) supplied the defect of nature, 
and made man's body to be incorruptible through the superatural 
spiritual gift.  <p>

<i>The penal guilt of sin (reatus).</i><p>

It is a law of nature and of man, that whatever rises against another 
will be put down, if possible. But whatever things are contained under 
one order are, in a certain way, one in that order. Hence whatever 
rises against any order will be put down by that order and by its head. 
But since sin is any inordinate act, it is manifest that he who us 
offends against some order which will seek to put him down. This is 
penalty. Now there are three orders against which man can sin, and with 
a three-fold penalty he can be finished his human nature is subject 
first to his own proper reason; next, to outward government, spiritual 
or mporal; lastly, to the universal order of Divine rule. He who sins 
acts against reason, against human law, against ivine law. Therefore he 
incurs a three-fold penalty -- <i>sc.</i>, from himself, remorse of 
conscience; from man, what law inflicts; and lastly, God's punishments. <p>

The penalty indeed is just, whether from man or from God; and so it is 
good, and not directly the effect of sin, which can have no good 
effects. But sin makes man guilty, which is an evil. "To be punished is 
not an evil, but to become worthy of punishment is an evil." Every 
disordered soul is its own punishment; but also it becomes liable to 
other punishment from perverting the order of Divine or human law. 
<!--
Qu. LXXXVII. 8.] THE EFFECTS OF SIN. 113  
--><A NAME="p113"></a><p>

<i>Does any sin incur eternal penalty?</i><p>

Sin incurs guilt, because it perverts some order. But while the cause 
remains, the effect remains. Hence, as long as this perversion of order 
continues, so long continues the penal guilt. But sometimes one 
perverts order irreparably, and sometimes not. For if defect destroy 
the foundation of anything, its first principle, such defect is 
irreparable. But otherwise, this first principle remaining, it may have 
power enough to repair the defect. But if by sin is corrupted the 
principle of order by which the human will is subject to God, this 
inordination is in itself irreparable only Divine grace can repair it. 
But this principle is the ultimate end, to which man adheres by 
charity. Therefore whatever sins turn man away from God, in taking away 
charity, incur the guilt of eternal penalty. <p>

(1) It is commonly objected that just penalty is adequate penalty; but 
sin is a transient thing, and therefore cannot incur eternal punishment 
(which would be out of all proportion to the offence). <p>

But I answer that it is true that the sharpness of punishment is 
proportioned to the offence both in Divine and ia human judgment. But 
this is not the question of duration. In no judgment is proportion 
sought for in that respect. A murder may be committed in a moment, yet 
the punishment may be imprisonment for life. The murderer is cut off 
forever from the society of the living, and so he represents, after his 
manner, the eternity of punishment Divinely inflicted. S. Gregory 
points out the justice of this, when he says (dial. iv. c. 44), "He who 
has sinned in his own eternity against God, is punished in the eternity 
of God." Man's "own eternity" does not mean simply the continuation of 
his act during this transient life, but that, having made sin his end, 
he has the will to sin forever. "The unjust would will to live forever, 
in order that they might forever continue in sin" (<i>Greg., Moral.</i>, 
iv.).  <p>

(2) But are not punishments medicinal? And no such 
<!--
114 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXXVIII. 5. 
--><A NAME="p114"></a>
 curing process can run on forever. I reply that not all human 
punishments are for the cure of him who has offended; the murderer is 
hung, that others may fear to offend. And the eternal punishment of the 
reprobate may he medicinal for others who (more earnestly) abstain from 
sin. <p>

(3) Again it is said that no one forever does that in which he takes no 
pleasure. But God takes no pleasure in the perdition of men; therefore 
it will not go on forever. The reply is that God takes no pleasure in 
suffering on its own account, but He takes pleasure in the order of His 
own justice, which requires the penalty of sin. <p>

<i>Penalty is proportioned to sin.</i><p>

But in sin are two elements; the one, aversion from the infinite 
incommutable good. On this side sin is infinite its penalty, infinite 
loss (<i>poena damni</i>), the loss of infinite good, <i>sc.</i>, of 
God. On the other side, sin is inordinate turning to mutable good. This 
is finite, like the good itself. For it is not the act of an infinite 
creature. To this corresponds a finite penalty of suffering 
(proportioned to the offence). <p>

<h4>&sect; 11. Venial and mortal sins.</h4><p>

<i>Sins are either venial or mortal.</i><p>

This distinction follows from the diversity of the inordination which 
is involved in sin. For there is a two-fold inordination one which 
casts off the very principle of order, another which still preserves 
it, although this inordination concerns things which are derived from 
that order. So in the body disorganization may attack the very life 
itself, and death is the result; or it may appear as sickness (which is 
not mortal disease). <p>

But the first principle of all order in morals is the ultimate end. 
Hence, when the soul is disordered through sin even to aversion from 
the ultimate end, which is God, to 
<!--
Qu. LXXXVIII. 1.] VENIAL AND MORTAL SINS.
--><A NAME="p1"></a>
 whom we are united through charity, the sin is mortal. But when the 
disorder does not proceed so far as that, the sin is venial. For as in 
the body mortal disorganization is naturally irreparable (while 
sickness which is not mortal may be cured by suitable means), so is it 
with the soul. He that sins by (wilfully) turning away from the 
ultimate end, so far as the nature of the sin is concerned, undergoes 
irreparable loss, and therefore his sin is mortal, its penalty 
eternal. But he who sins without wilful aversion from God, is 
disordered in a manner which, according to the nature of the sin, can 
be repaired, because the first principle of spiritual life is 
preserved; and therefore he is said to sin venially, because the 
result is not eternal death. <p>

Mortal and venial sin differ infinitely as respects the aversion in the 
two sins. But it is not so as respects the turning to transitory good. 
Hence, in the same kind of sin may be found the one and the other, as 
the very first motion of the soul towards the sin of adultery may be 
venial, and an idle word, which is often venial, may become a mortal 
sin. <p>

Venial sins contain inordination, not with respect to the end, for 
the life of charity remains in the soul, but with respect to the means 
for that end. Such sins are reparable. <p>

(1) It might be said that all sin is mortal because it is against the 
law of God. But Venial sin is imperfectly sin, for it is not a word, 
thought, or deed (intentionally done) against that law. He who sins 
venially does not do what the law prohibits, nor omit what the law 
commands; but he acts aside from law, in not observing those limits of 
reason which the law aims at. <p>

(2) It is commanded, indeed, that we do all things to the glory of God; 
and he who sins venially does not at that time do so. But he may 
habitually refer himself and all his affairs to the glory of God, which 
is essentially obedience to such an affirmative precept. <p>


116 ON VICES AND SINS. [Qu. LXXXVIII. 2.  <p>

<i>Some sins are venial in their specics, some are mortal.</i><p>

Some sins may be venial from their cause, as infirmity or ignorance, 
which diminishes the gravity of the offence. Or, again, and this is 
what we are now considering, venial sins may be those which do not take 
away due relation to the ultimate end, nor merit everlasting 
punishment. In this sense, and as the object determines the specific 
character of the act, some sins are venial in their proper nature, and 
some are mortal. For when the will is directed to anything which in 
itself is opposed to charity, which orders man for his ultimate end, 
the sin is mortal in kind, whether it be against the love of God, as 
blasphemy, perjury, and the like, or against the love of our neighbour, 
as murder, adultery, and the like. But if the will is directed to that 
which contains some inordination, indeed, hut is not directly contrary 
to the love of God and of our neighbour, as the idle word, etc., such 
sin is venial in its kind. But since moral acts take their character 
not only from their objects, but also from the disposition of the 
agent, what is in itself venial may become mortal on the part of that 
agent, either because he makes it his ultimate end, or because he uses 
it as means for some other and a mortal sin. So again, on the part of 
the agent, that which is in itself mortal may become venial, because 
the act is imperfect, <i>i.e.</i>, not proceeding from deliberate 
reason.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup>  
<!--
Qu. LXXXVIII. 8.1] VENIAL AND MORTAL SINS. 117  
--><A NAME="p117"></a><p>

Observe that in choosing what is opposed to Divine charity, a man 
prefers that thing to the love of God; he loves himself more than God. 
This is mortal sin.  in lice ways venial sin may dispose towards mortal 
sin. <p>

(1) The habit being augmented by repeated acts, the lust of sinning can 
increase so far that he who sins makes the venial sin his end. And so 
by repeated acts of venial sin, the sinner is prepared for mortal sin. 
This on the part of the agent. <p>

(2) Again, a human act may prepare the way for something by removing 
hindrances. Venial sin may thus prepare the way for mortal sin. For in 
accustoming the will in minor matters to neglect the due order of life, 
the way is prepared for casting off that order as respects the ultimate 
end, in choosing mortal sin.  <p>

Sin in itself venial may become mortal (a) through an erroneous 
conscience, which regards it as a more serious offence (b) through 
scandal given by it; (c) through gravely evil intention, as contempt 
of the lawmaker (consider the "forbidden fruit" in Paradise); (d) 
through evil affection preferring the little sin to God; (e) through 
directly leading to mortal sin. <p>

(In doubt, especially in the case of sensitive souls, the confessor 
takes the milder view and leaves the rest to God.) <p>

<hr><p>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a></a> We may distinguish three forms of internal sin (a) free and 
continued pleasure in imagined evil, implying consent to it, the 
<i>"detectatio morosa"</i> of the text; (b) the same respecting past 
sin, implying approbation of it, although skill, etc. (<i>e.g.</i>, in 
trade), may be admired without approving the act, as "the lord 
commended the unjust steward" (lascivious tales, however, having their 
own special danger) (c) sinful desires with an act of will, which is 
efficacious, when there is intention of acting out the desire (S. Matt. 
v. 28). The evil thought rejected at once is not sin. <p>

<a name="n_2"><a href="#n2">{2}</a></a> The reasoning of S. Thomas Aquinas may here seem very subtle to one 
who has not previously looked into its subject. But it demands and will 
well repay careful and prolonged thought. -- J. J. B. <p>

<a name="n_3"><a href="#n3">{3}</a></a> If one knows that the outward action is wrong, no 
invincible ignorance respecting the laws of spiritual 
morality can excuse his evil desire of that action. <p>

<a name="n_4"><a href="#n4">{4}</a></a> Affirmative laws bind only under suitable conditions; 
negative laws are continually binding. <p>

<a name="n_5"><a href="#n5">{5}</a></a> But inadvertence itself, which often seems to be a note of venial 
sin, may show an habitual affection for sin, even when the act is not 
perfectly voluntary; <i>i.e.</i>, a perfected sin. <p>

A positive doubt respecting the deadly malice of the act may itself 
constitute full advertence, and make the sin a mortal one. Deadly, 
also, may be needless exposure to the danger of falling into mortal 
sin; it may be the sin of presumption. <p>

It is grave sin to deliberate about consent to mortal sin. <p>

The matter of venial acts may coalesce into mortal acts. Thus the 
apparently trifling act of giving light weight and short measure in 
retail trade accumulates its results, and it may enrich one, who may be 
thus guilty of serious theft.
