<h3>CHAPTER IV.  VICES OPPOSED TO CHARITY.</h3>  <p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Hatred.</h4><p>

<i>Can any one hate God?</i><p>

If not, why did the Lord say (S. John xv. 24), "But now have they both 
seen and hated both Me and My Father"? Observe, then, that hatred is a 
passion moved by something which is apprehended. But God may be 
apprehended either in His essence or in His effects. But in His essence 
He is that Goodness which no being can hate, but all must love. There 
are some of His effects, also, which cannot be in any way contrary to 
our will, as life and thought, which He produces, and which are sought 
by all. So far God cannot be hated. But there are certain effects of 
God which the inordinate will opposes, as the infliction of penalty and 
the restraint of sins by Divine law. And as regards the consideration 
of such effects, God can be hated.  Hatred of God is the greatest of 
sins. <p>

For the defect in sin consists in aversion from God. (See page 107.) 
But such aversion would not be guilt if it were not voluntary. Guilt 
(<i>"culpa "</i>), therefore, consists in voluntary aversion from God. 
But this voluntary aversion from God is found, <i>per se</i>, in hatred 
of God, while in other sins it exists, as it were, by participation. 
For as the will, per Se, cleaves to that which it loves, so in itself 
it shuns that which it hates. Hence, when any one bates God, his will, 
<i>per se</i>, is averted from God. But, in other sins -- say, 
<!--
Qu. XXXIV. 8.] HATRED. 239 
--><A NAME="p239"></a> 
 in sensual sins -- the will is indirectly averted from God, inasmuch 
as it seeks inordinate pleasure, to which this aversion is annexed. 
Hence, hatred of God is the gravest of sins. <p>

(1) This hatred is deliberate malice, which is sin against the Holy 
Ghost. <p>

(2) Infidelity is a fault only as it is voluntary; and the more 
voluntary it is, the graver is the sin. But its being voluntary comes 
from one's hating the truth which is presented to him. Hence, it is 
evident that the sin in infidelity springs from hatred of God, whose 
truth is the object of faith. Therefore, as the cause is more potent 
than the effect, the hatred of God is a greater sin than the 
infidelity. <p>

(3) It is not true that whoever hates punishment hates God, who is the 
author of it. But to rush into hatred of God as punisher, is hating the 
justice of God, which is the gravest of all sins.  <p>

<i>Is all hatred of our neighbour a sin?</i><p>

Hatred is opposed to love; and hatred is so far evil as love is good. 
But love is our neighbour's due according to what he has from God; 
<i>i.e.</i>, according to nature and grace. But love is not his due 
according to what he has from himself and the devil; <i>sc.</i>, 
according to sin and defect of righteousness. And therefore it is 
lawful to hate sin in our brother, and all that pertains to defect of 
righteousness but one cannot hate his brother's nature and grace 
without mortal sin. But this very thing, that we hate in our brother 
his fault and defect of good, pertains to love of our brother, for it 
is all one to will another's good and to hate his evil. understood 
simply, then, hatred of our brother is always sin. "He that hateth his 
brother is in darkness" (1 Ep. S. John ii. 9). <p>

But is it not natural, and therefore right, to hate our enemies? For 
they are opposed to us and aim at our ruin. 
<!--
240 VICES OPPOSED TO CHARITY. [Qu. XXXIV. 4, 6.  
--><A NAME="p240"></a>
 But according to what they have from God, they are not contrary to us, 
and are to be loved. We ought to hate that they are enemies.  <p>

<i>Is hatred of our neighbour the gravest sin, against him?</i><p>

The evil of sin against our neighbour is two-fold: one, the disordered 
will of him who sins, which is the root of sin; another, the injury 
which is done to our neighbour. As regards the first, hatred is greater 
sin than outward injurious acts, and if the outward acts were 
inordinate without any inordination of will, they would not be sin, as 
when one ignorantly, or in zeal for justice, kills a man. And if there 
is any fault in outward sins which are committed against our neighbour, 
all springs from inward hatred. But as respects the injury which is 
done, outward sins are worse than inward hatred. <p>

Hatred is not counted among the capital sins, because it is last, not 
first, in the order of destruction of what is virtuous in man; for it 
is most opposed to nature. It is most natural to man to love his 
neighbour's good.  <p>

<i>Does hatred spring from envy?</i><p>

Hatred of our neighbour is the ultimate in the progress of sin, in that 
it is opposed to the natural love of our neighbour. But the reason why 
one recedes from what is natural is that he aims to avoid what is 
naturally to be shunned. But naturally every animal shuns what causes 
sorrow, and seeks what gives pleasure. And as from pleasure springs 
love, so from sorrow springs hate. Hence, since envy is sorrow at 
another's good, it follows that that good is rendered hateful to us, 
and from envy springs hatred. <p>

In another way, and more indirectly, as disposing to the ultimate, 
anger may cause hatred. For anger at first seeks our neighbour's evil, 
under the notion of just vengeance but afterwards, being prolonged, a 
man may desire absolutely that evil, which pertains to hatred. 
<!--
Qu. XXXV. 1, 8.] SPIRITUAL SLOTH. 241  
--><A NAME="p241"></a><p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Spiritual sloth ("acedia").</h4><p>

This is opposed to that spiritual joy in Divine good which is the 
inward effect of charity. <sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup>  <p>

<i>Is spiritual sloth a sin?</i><p>

It is "a torpor of a mind which neglects to begin good things" (S. 
Aug., Ps. cvi.). But a sorrow of this kind respecting spiritual good is 
evil in itself. Even sorrow respecting what is truly evil may be bad in 
its effects, if it so load down a man that he totally withdraws himself 
from good works. Spiritual sloth, therefore, is evil, both in itself 
and in its effects. And, therefore, since it belongs to the will, it is 
a sin. <p>

Humility, looking at one's own defects, does not exalt self; but it is 
ingratitude if one despise the good things which God has given, and 
from such contempt follows spiritual sloth. <p>

As a special vice it wearies of the Divine good, in which charity 
rejoices.  <p>

<i>Is spiritual sloth a mortal sin?</i><p>

Mortal sin destroys the spiritual life in which God dwells in us 
through charity. And that sin is mortal which in its own proper nature 
is opposed to charity. Now spiritual sloth is such; for the effect of 
charity is joy in God; but spiritual sloth is weariness of spiritual 
good as Divine. <p>

But sins which are in themselves mortal are only such when they attain 
their consummation. And the Consummation of human sin, which consists 
in a human act, is in the consent of reason. Hence if the beginning of 
sin is in the sense-nature alone, and does not reach the consent of 
reason, the sin is venial on account of the imperfection of the act. So 
concupiscence is mortal or venial sin according as it has or has not 
the consent of reason. So also 
<!--
242 VICES OPPOSED TO CHARITY. [Qu. XXXVI. 1, 2.  
--><A NAME="p242"></a>
 the motion of spiritual sloth is sometimes in the sensuous nature 
alone, through the repugnance of the flesh against the spirit, and then 
it is venial sin. But sometimes it reaches the reason, which consents 
to flight from the Divine good, and feels horror of it and detestation 
of it, the flesh altogether prevailing against the spirit. This is 
manifestly mortal sin. It is a capital sin, because on account of it 
many evil things are done either to avoid the disagreeable effort 
required by the spiritual life, or because the burden of this spiritual 
sloth produces sinful acts which harmonize with it. S. Gregory (Moral. 
xxxi. 17) names six daughters of spiritual sloth: (1) Despair of the 
end; (2) pusillanimity with respect to the means; (3) sluggishness 
respecting obedience to God's commands; (4) rancor at spiritual 
counsellors who urge to a better life; (5) an evil mind towards 
spiritual goods themselves; (6) a heart wearied with spiritual joy and 
wandering after corporal pleasure.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. Envy.  What is envy?</h4><p>

Another's good may be apprehended as one's own evil, and so there can 
be sorrow at it. And this in two ways one, when danger of injury 
threatens one's self, and so one is saddened at another's good; as when 
his enemy is exalted, and so he fears that harm may be done to himself. 
Such sadness is not envy, but rather the effect of fear. But, again, 
another's good may be esteemed as one's own evil, diminishing one's own 
glory or excellence; in this way envy is troubled at another's good. 
Envy, therefore, especially regards those goods from which glory 
arises, and in which men love to be honoured and held in high 
reputation.  <p>

<i>Is envy a sin?</i><p>

Sadness at another's good may arise in four ways : (1) When one fears 
injury to himself or to his good things, as 
<!--
Qu. XXXVI. 3.] ENVY. 243 
--><A NAME="p243"></a>
 the result of such prosperity. This is not envy, and may exist without 
sin. "It may happen that without loss of charity, an enemy's ruin makes 
us glad, and again his glory saddens us without envy; since we believe 
that by his fall others will well be lifted up, and in his prosperity 
we fear that many will be unjustly oppressed" (Greg., Moral. xxii. 6). <p>

(2) One may be saddened in consequence of another's good, not because 
he has it, but because that good is wanting in ourselves. And this is 
properly emulation; and if that emulation concerns moral goods, it is 
laudable. But if it refer to earthly goods, it may be sinful, or it may 
not be so. <p>

(3) He for whom the good happens may be unworthy of it. Sadness at 
this, indeed, cannot arise from those moral goods by which any one is 
made righteous. But it may spring from wealth acquired, and from other 
such things as both the worthy and the unworthy can obtain. And this 
sadness pertains to indignation (<i>"nemesis"</i>), and is connected 
with good habits. But such a view of earthly goods leaves out of sight 
the eternal verities. But according to the doctrine of faith, the 
temporal goods which the unworthy obtain are distributed according to 
the just ordination of God, either for the correction of the unworthy, 
or for their condemnation. Goods of this kind are as nothing in 
comparison with the future goods which are reserved for those who are 
worthy of them. Such sadness is forbidden by the Holy Scriptures : 
"Fret not thyself because of the ungodly, neither be thou envious 
against the evil doers " (Ps. xxxvii. 1). <p>

(4) One is saddened at another's good, inasmuch as that other exceeds 
himself, and this is properly envy; and this is sin, grieving at what 
ought to cause rejoicing, <i>sc.</i>, another's welfare.  <p>

<i>Is envy a mortal sin?</i><p>

It is certainly a species of mortal sin. For sin gets its specific 
character from its object. Now envy, according to 
<!--
244 VICES OPPOSED TO CHARITY. [Qu. XXXVII. 1. 
--><A NAME="p244"></a>
 its object, is the opposite of charity, through which comes the 
spiritual life of the soul. "We know that we have passed from death to 
life, because we love the brethren" (1 Ep. S. John iii. 14). The 
object, both in envy and in charity, is the good of our neighbour; for 
charity rejoices at it, but envy is saddened by it. Manifestly, then, 
envy is, in its species, a mortal sin. <p>

But we have seen (page 115) that in every kind of sin are found certain 
imperfect motions in the sensuous nature, which are venial sins, as in 
homicide, the first motions of anger. So also in envy are found certain 
primal motions, sometimes even in good men, which are venial sins. <p>

(1) These come from the passion on which envy is grounded, which 
passion is seen even in little children. <p>

(2) The grief which the Psalmist expressed (<i>"nemesis"</i>) was at 
the prosperity df the unworthy (Ps. lxxiii. 3), which is the opposite 
of envy at the prosperity of the worthy.  <p>

<i>Envy is a capital sin.</i><p>

The child of pride is vainglory, and this begets envy. The daughters of 
envy are secret backbiting and open detraction, exultation at our 
neighbour's adversity and efforts to impede his prosperity, and, last, 
and the culmination of all, hatred of our neighbour.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. Discord and strife.</h4><p>

<i>Discord is a mortal sin.</i><p>

S. Paul (Gal. v. 20) places divisions among the works of the flesh, and 
"they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." 
Discord is opposed to concord, which springs from charity joining the 
hearts of many, first, in Divine good, and next, in the good of our 
neighbour. Therefore discord is sin. <p>

But discord may take away this concord, first, <i>per se</i> -- 
<i>i.e.</i>, according to the intention, when one knowingly dissents 
from Divine good, and his neighbour's good to which he 
<!--
Qu. XXXVII. 1.] DISCORD AND STRIFE. 245 
--><A NAME="p245"></a>
 ought to consent. This is mortal sin in kind, because it is opposed to 
charity, although the first motions of this discord may be venial 
through their being imperfect acts. But discord may, again, destroy 
concord <i>per accidens</i> -- <i>i.e.</i>, without such intention, 
when different persons aim at some good which pertains to the glory of 
God or the benefit of our neighbour, but one judges a certain course to 
be good, while another has a contrary opinion. Then discord is, <i>per 
accidens</i>, contrary to the Divine good or the good of our neighbour. 
Such discord is not sin, nor contrary to charity, unless there be error 
respecting what is necessary to salvation, or undue obstinacy in one's 
opinion. For concord, which is the effect of charity, is the union of 
wills, not the union of opinions (page 215). Discord, then, is 
sometimes the sin of one, when he knowingly resists the good which 
another wills; and sometimes it is the sin of both parties, when each 
dissents from the good of the other and loves his own good. <p>

(1) But you may say that another's will is not the rule of yours, but 
only the Divine will is such. And this is true of that other's will 
considered in itself; but when that will adheres to the Divine, it does 
become the rule for others also, and discord with such a will is 
discord with the Divine rule. <p>

(2) But S. Paul excited discord between the Pharisees and the Sadducees 
(Acts xxiii. 6). I answer that to destroy that good concord which 
charity produces is a grave sin; "He that soweth discord among brethren 
is an abomination unto the Lord" (Prov. vi. 16). But to take away the 
evil concord of bad wills is laudable, and the Lord Himself said (S. 
Matt. x. 34), "I came not to send peace, but a sword." <p>

(3) The discord between SS. Paul and Barnabas (Acts xv. 39) was per 
aceidens, because each was aiming at the good, but to the one a certain 
course seemed to be good; to the other, another. This was due to human 
imperfection, for the controversy did not concern what is necessary to 
salva<!--
246 VICES OPPOSED TO CHARITY. [Qu. xxxviii. 1. 
 --><A NAME="p246"></a>tion. Even this dissension was ordained by Divine Providence for 
the resulting benefit of the world. <p>

If discord is viewed as a departure from another's will, it may be 
called the daughter of envy; but viewed as depending on self-seeking, 
it is the child of vainglory.  <p>

<i>Is contention (strife) a mortal sin?</i><p>

S. Paul (Gal. v. 20) places it with discord among the works of the 
flesh which exclude any one from the kingdom of God; therefore it is a 
mortal sin. As discord expresses contrariety of wills, so contention 
implies the same in speech. But we must look at the intention and at 
the manner of contending. In the intention we must consider whether one 
is contending against the truth, which is blameworthy, or against 
falsehood, which is laudable. And in the manner, we are to consider if 
it is suitable to the persons and the things; for if so, it is 
laudable. If, then, contention signify impugning the truth and an 
inordinate manner of contending, it is mortal sin. But if it be an 
impugning of falsehood with proper acrimony, it is laudable. But if, 
again, it be contending against falsehood in an inordinate manner, it 
may be venial sin, unless perhaps the inordination is so great as to 
cause scandal of others. So S. Paul says of such strife (2 Tim. ii. 
14), that it tends to "the subverting of the hearers." <sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

When the disciples contended (S. Luke xxii. 24), they did not mean to 
impugn the truth, for each one was defending what he thought to be 
true; but their contention was inordinate, being about an improper 
object; <i>sc.</i>, the primacy of honour, for they were not yet 
spiritual men. Therefore the Lord checked their contention. <p>

Contention, like discord, is the daughter of vainglory. For pride and 
vainglory seek one's own superiority, which may be done in speech and 
cause strife of words. 
<!--
Qu. xxxix. 1.] SCHISM 247  
--><A NAME="p247"></a><p>

<h4>&sect; 5. Schism.  Is schism a special sin?</h4><p>

It is directly and <i>per se</i> opposed to unity, and it is a special 
sin when one intends to separate himself from that unity which charity 
makes, which not only unites one to another in the spiritual bond of 
love, but also unites the whole Church in the unity of the Spirit. And, 
therefore, properly speaking, schismatics are those who spontaneously 
and intentionally separate themselves from the unity of the Church, 
which is the principal unity. For the particular unity of Christian man 
with Christian man is ordained for the unity of the Church, as the 
union of member with member in the body is for the unity of the whole 
body. But the unity of the Church depends on two things; first, the 
communion of the members with one another, and next, the subordination 
of all the members to the one Head (which is Christ), "the Head from 
whom all the body, being supplied and knit together through the joints 
and bands, increaseth with the increase of God" (Col. ii. 19). <p>

(1) All sin separates man from God; but this is not necessarily schism, 
since it may not be the intention of the sinner to separate himself 
from God, but to turn inordinately to temporal good. <p>

(2) Every sinner disobeys the precepts of the Church, but the 
schismatic does so with rebellion, since he pertinaciously despises 
those precepts and refuses to submit his judgment. Every sinner does 
not do this. <p>

(3) Heresy is opposed to faith, but schism per se is opposed to the 
unity of charity in the Church. Therefore, as faith and charity are 
diverse virtues, although whoever lacks faith lacks also charity, so 
schism and heresy are diverse vices, although whoever is a heretic is 
also a schismatic, but not conversely. And yet, as loss of charity is 
the road to loss of faith (1 Tim. i. 6), so schism is the road to 
heresy. 
<!--
248 VICES OPPOSED TO CHARITY. [Qu. XXXIX. 2. 
--><A NAME="p248"></a>
 Hence, S. Jerome well remarks that "there is no schism which does not 
invent to itself some heresy (note this), in order to justify its 
separation from the Church" (Ep. ad Titum, cap. 3).  <p>

<i>Is schism a graver sin than infidelity?</i><p>

The gravity of a sin depends upon the species of the sin and also upon 
its circumstances. But the particular circumstances are infinite in 
number and infinitely varied. And so, in comparing two sins in order to 
find which is the worse, we have to look only at their specific 
character. But this depends upon the object; and, therefore, that sin 
is the greater which is opposed to the greater good, as sin against God 
is worse than sin against our neighbour. But infidelity is sin against 
God Himself as the primal verity on which faith rests; while schism is 
against Church unity, which is a derived good and less than God 
Himself. So it is plain that the sin of infidelity is specifically 
graver than the sin of schism, although it may happen that some 
schismatic sins more deeply than some infidel, either on account of 
greater contempt or greater peril to others' souls, or some such 
reason. <p>

(1) But schism is against the good of the multitude, whereas infidelity 
is only against the particular good of one. Yes; but there is a greater 
good than either of those, which is the Divine verity, to which 
unbelief is opposed. <p>

(2) But schism is a sin against charity, which is a higher virtue than 
faith, to which infidelity is opposed. Yes; but charity has two 
objects, Divine goodness, and our neighbour's good. And schism is a sin 
against the good of our neighbour, which is less than the object of 
faith, viz., God Himself. Yet, of all the sins against our neighbour, 
schism seems to be the greatest, because it is against the spiritual 
good of the multitude. 
<!--

--><A NAME="p249"></a><p>

<i>Here note that schismatical clergy have the authority which belongs 
to their orders, for this sacramental power is conferred once for all 
through a consecration to that end.</i><p>

Heresy or schism does not annul it, for if they return to the Church 
they are not ordained or consecrated anew. (See the Novatian schism, 
Conc. Nic., canon viii.) <p>

But this sacramental power is not lawfully used without the sanction of 
superior authority in the Church. If, however, it should be illicitly 
used, it has its ordained sacramental effect, because in sacraments man 
is only God's instrument, and the fault of the minister does not 
destroy the efficacy of what he instrumentally does. <p>

But authority of jurisdiction is conferred by men who have it, and is 
not indelible, like Holy Orders. Open schismatics and heretics may lose 
by man's decree what man has given.  <p>

<h4>6. Wars, quarrels, and seditions.</h4><p>

<i>Is making war always a sin?</i><p>

Three requisites are demanded for a righteous war: (1) due authority -- 
<i>sc.</i>, that of the commonwealth -- for it does not pertain to any 
private person to make war, since his private right can be prosecuted 
through the judgment of his superior. And, again, to summon the people, 
which is necessary in war, cannot be done by a private individual. But 
as those who have charge of the commonwealth may lawfully defend it 
with the sword against internal disturbance, punishing malefactors with 
death (Rom. xiii. 4), So it belongs to them to defend the state from 
external enemies with the sword of war. <p>

(2) A just cause for war is requisite; viz., that those who are 
attacked deserve attack for some grave fault. <p>

(3) There must be right intention on the part of those who make war; 
<i>sc.</i>, that good be promoted or evil avoided. But it can happen 
that war is declared by legitimate 
<!--
250 VICES OPPOSED TO CHARITY. [Qu. XL. 1. 
--><A NAME="p250"></a>
 authority and for a just cause, and yet the war may be unrighteous on 
account of the evil intention of those who begin it; <i>e.g.</i>, their 
eagerness to injure, their fierceness of revenge, their implacable 
mind, their lust of new dominion. <p>

(1) But did not the Lord say (S. Matt. xxvi. 52), "All they that take 
the sword, shall perish by the sword"? But S. Augustine says justly 
(Cont. Faust. xxii. 70), "He takes the sword who is armed against 
another's life without any superior or legitimate authority which 
orders or permits him to do so." If any private person with due 
authority, or any public person through zeal for justice and with God's 
authority, use the sword, he does not himself take it, but he employs 
it as entrusted to him by another. <p>

And those also who sinfully use the sword are not always slain with the 
sword, but they themselves always perish through their own sword, 
because for the sin of the sword they are punished everlastingly, 
unless they repent. <p>

(2) But, again, the Lord said (S. Matt. v. 39), "Resist not evil;" and 
in the Epistle to the Romans we read (Rom. xii. 19), "Avenge not 
yourselves, but give place unto wrath." I reply that precepts of this 
nature (affirmative), as S. Augustine says (Serm. Dom. in Monte, i. 
19), are always to be observed in the preparedness of the soul; 
<i>sc.</i>, a man must always be prepared to make no resistance, to 
give up self-defence, if there be reason for doing so. But sometimes it 
is a duty to act otherwise, for the sake of the good of the community, 
or even for the sake of those against whom one contends. If license to 
work iniquity be taken away thereby, it is well to conquer in war. <p>

(3) But war is contrary to the virtue of peace. Yes; but those who wage 
just war are aiming at lasting peace, not that evil peace of which the 
Lord said, "Think not that I came to send peace on the earth" (S. Matt. 
x. 34). 
<!--
251 Qu. XLI.] WARS, QUARRELS, AND SEDITIONS. 
--><A NAME="p251"></a><p>

<i>Is it lawful for priests and bishops to engage in war?</i><p>

For the good of human society many things are necessary, and some are 
inconsistent with others, so that they cannot well be exercised by the 
same persons. And military affairs are most of all repugnant to those 
duties which belong to priests and bishops for two reasons; first, they 
withdraw the mind from that Divine service for which the clergy are 
appointed; next, the clergy are ordained to set forth the sacrifice 
of Christ; therefore, instead of shedding others' blood, they should 
be ready to give their own for Christ's sake. <p>

(1) It pertains indeed to prelates and priests to resist -- wolves, 
robbers, tyrants; but their weapons are not carnal, but spiritual (2 
Cor. x. 4); <i>i.e.</i>, admonitions, prayers, and excommunications. <p>

(2) The clergy may spiritually aid those waging just war by their 
spiritual ministrations. They may call on others to undertake a just 
war, for engaging personally in it is not forbidden to them because it 
is wrong, but because it is inconsistent with their holy office. <p>

Promised faith must be kept, even with enemies in war but just war may 
call for stratagems and secret snares; for such things, in such a 
case, are not repugnant to justice, nor do they spring from inordinate 
will.  <p>

<i>Are quarrels, "fightings" (rixae), always sin?</i><p>

As contention implies contradiction in words, so these private 
"fightings" imply the going to blows. It is a sort of private war, 
without public authority, and springing from an inordinate will. Such 
quarrels always imply sin. In him who unjustly attacks another, it is 
mortal sin, for injury wilfully done to our neighbour cannot be without 
mortal sin. <p>

But in him who defends himself there may be no sin at all, or venial 
sin, or mortal sin, according to his mind and manner in defending 
himself. For if he only intend 
<!--
252 VICES OPPOSED TO CHARITY. [Qu. XLII. 2. 
--><A NAME="p252"></a>
 to repel injury offered, and with due moderation defend himself, the 
quarrel is not on his side. But if he do so with a vindictive mind, or 
one filled with hatred, or in undue excess, there is always sin; 
venial, indeed, when the sinful impulse is not a grave one, or the lack 
of moderation is not serious; but mortal, when he is steadily bent on 
doing serious injury to the other party. Fightings of this kind are the 
children of anger rather than of hatred. For the latter aims absolutely 
at harming an enemy whether openly or secretly, matters not. But 
anger, the desire for vengeance, is not satisfied with secretly doing 
harm, but desires that the other party may know that he is suffering 
the consequences of his wrong-doing. And this is implied also in 
quarrels, or fightings (<i>"rixae"</i>).  <p>

<i>Is sedition a special sin?</i><p>

It has something in common with wars and fightings; but the first are 
properly against external foes, nation arrayed against nation; the 
second are the conflicts of one against one, or of few against few; but 
sedition is properly between the different parts of one people 
disagreeing with one another, one part of the state contending with 
another. And, therefore, because it is opposed to a special good -- 
<i>sc.</i>, the unity and peace of the community -- it is a special 
sin.  <p>

<i>Is sedition always a mortal sin?</i><p>

The unity to which sedition is opposed is the unity of justice and the 
common good, and it is mortal sin in its kind, and so much the graver 
sin as the common good is of more importance than that private good 
which is impugned by private quarrels. But the sin of sedition 
primarily and principally belongs to those who stir up sedition; these 
sin most gravely; but next, those are involved in it who follow those 
disturbers of the common peace. But those who resist them and defend 
the common 
<!--
253 Qu. XLIII. 1.] SCANDAL. 
--><A NAME="p253"></a>
 good are no more seditious than those who defend themselves are 
quarrelsome. <p>

The rule of tyrants is not just, because it is not ordained for the 
common good, but for the private benefit of the ruler himself. And, 
therefore, arousing the people against this tyrannical rule is not 
sedition, unless possibly when this tyranny is so inordinately attacked 
that the subject people suffer more detriment from the consequent 
disturbance than they did from tyrannical rule. But it is rather the 
tyrant who is seditious, nourishing discords and seditious among the 
people, in order that he may more easily keep them down.  <p>

<h4>7. Scandal.</h4><p>

<i>What is scandal?</i><p>

This vice, opposed to the beneficence of charity, may be defined, with 
S. Augustine (Contra Faust. xxii. 27), as "a word or deed deficient in 
rectitude, giving occasion for the spiritual ruin of another." As one 
may put a stumbling-block in another's way, so that, if he encounter 
it, he is liable to get a fall, so, in the progress along the spiritual 
road, one by his advice, persuasion, or example may lead another into 
sin; this is scandal. But nothing according to its proper nature 
disposes any one to spiritual ruin, unless it be deficient in 
rectitude. For that which is perfectly right rather strengthens one 
against a fall than leads him to his ruin. <p>

Both that is defective in rectitude which is evil in itself, and that 
which has the appearance of evil; for even if there be no corrupt 
intention in it, it may give occasion for another's fall. And therefore 
the apostle said (1 Thess. v. 22), "Abstain from every appearance of 
evil." <p>

The word or deed of any one can be in two ways the occasion for 
another's sin. First, <i>per se</i>, when the evil word or deed is 
actually intended to induce another to sin (direct, active scandal); 
or, even though not so intended, the action 
<!--
254 VICES OPPOSED TO CHARITY. [Qu. XLIII. 2. 
--><A NAME="p254"></a>
 is of such a nature that it incites another to do wrong (indirect, 
active scandal); as when one publicly sins, or does what has the 
appearance of evil. And then he who does anything of this kind, 
properly speaking, gives occasion for falling. These are active 
scandals. <p>

But, secondly, <i>per accidens</i> some word or deed of one person is 
the cause of another's sinning, when, apart from the intention of the 
one who does the action, and without the action itself having any such 
tendency, some one ill-disposed is by this action induced to sin, say, 
to envy another's goods; and then he whose action is right does not 
give occasion, but the other takes it. This is passive scandal without 
any active scandal. Sometimes, then, it happens that active scandal is 
found in one and passive scandal in another, as when one induces 
another to commit sin. But sometimes there is active scandal without 
the passive, as when one by word or deed tries to lead another into 
sin, and he does not consent. And finally there is sometimes passive 
scandal without active (the scandal of the weak through ignorance or 
infirmity, and the scandal of the Pharisee through his own malicious 
wickedness).  <p>

<i>Is scandal a sin?</i><p>

Passive scandal -- <i>i.e.</i>, the scandal in him who receives it -- 
is always sin in him, since he is not, properly speaking, scandalized, 
unless in some way he fall into spiritual ruin, which is sin. (Note 
that "offence," Rom. xiv. 21, is indignation against him who sins, 
which can exist without this fall.) But passive scandal can exist 
without any sin on his part from whom the scandal proceeds, as when any 
one is scandalized by those things which another has done with perfect 
rectitude. <p>

Similarly, active scandal also is always sin in him who gives the 
occasion for it, because either what he does is sin, or, if it have 
only the appearance of evil, he is bound in charity to avoid it, since 
it is the duty of every one to care for his 
<!--
255 Qu. XLIII. 3, 4.] SCANDAL.  
--><A NAME="p255"></a>
neighbour's salvation. And so he who does not avoid occasion for 
scandal acts against charity. But we have seen that the active scandal 
may exist without any sin on the other side (<i>e.g.</i>, one may be 
"offended," without himself falling). <p>

(1) The Lord said (S. Matt. xviii. 7), "It must needs be that 
offences (scandals) come." But this is not to be understood in the 
sense of absolute necessity. There is a conditional necessity of what 
God foreknows or has foretold; also there is a conditional necessity 
of that which is useful for some end, and scandals are useful that they 
"who are approved may be made manifest" (1 Cor. xi. 19). Scandals are 
conditionally necessary, also, according to the condition of men who 
will not keep themselves from sin. So a physician might say, when he 
saw the mischievous diet of his patient, "He is bound to have a long 
spell of sickness;" meaning, if he do not change his diet.  <p>

Active scandal <i>per se</i> -- <i>i.e.</i>, when one by his word or 
deed intends to draw another into sin -- is a special sin, not that 
which is <i>per accidens</i>, there being no such intention (direct or 
indirect). <p>

For the aiming at a special end constitutes a new sin over and above 
the original sinfulness of the act in question. And so active scandal 
may be found apart from other sins, as when one scandalizes his 
neighbour by an act which is not sin in itself, but which has the 
appearance of evil.  <p>

<i>Is scandal a mortal sin?</i><p>

Passive scandal may be a stumbling only, without actual fall; this 
will be venial sin, as when one through the inordinate word or deed of 
another is moved in a venial manner only. But passive scandal may be 
mortal, sin, as when one in such a case proceeds to actual mortal sin. <p>

But active scandal, if it be <i>per accidens</i> (not intended either 
directly or indirectly), may be venial sin, as when the thing which is 
done is in itself venial, or has only the 
<!--
256 VICES OPPOSED TO CHARITY. [Qu. XLIII. 7. 
--><A NAME="p256"></a>
 appearance of evil, and is committed through some light indiscretion. <p>

But sometimes it is mortal sin, whether because the act is in itself 
such, or because the salvation of our neighbour is made of no account, 
and one does not for the sake of that give up what he chooses to do. 
But if we speak of active scandal <i>per se</i> -- viz., the intending 
to lead another into sin -- it is mortal if the sin is such, or if the 
intention is such in him who gives scandal; but it may be venial if sin 
and intention are such. <p>

In this way we may understand the Gospel (S. Matt. xviii. 6), and S. 
Paul (1 Cor. viii. 12). <p>

Those who perfectly adhere to God through love take no occasion of 
stumbling from others' words or deeds. Much less do they give 
reasonable occasion for active scandal to the weak. Through human 
infirmity, iadeed, they may fall somewhat short of the perfect standard 
set before them, but they do not go far away, nor so far that another 
can reasonably take occasion of sin from their words or deeds. <p>

Remember, however, that one may scandalize himself (Pharisaic scandal). 
Consider the ease of S. Peter (Gal. ii. 14); was his sin so grave that 
others could be justly scandalized? (Or did he fall, and repent, and 
return to the measure of a perfect man?) <p>

Venial sins may be found in perfect men, but they are chiefly those 
sudden motions of the passions which are inward and do not give 
scandal. If those infirmities appear outwardly in venial sins, those 
sins are so light as not to have in themselves power of giving scandal.  <p>

<i>May spiritual goods be given up on account of scandal?</i><p>

There can be no question about active scandal. Sin can never be lawful. 
But if we speak of passive scandal, there may be a question as to what 
is to be given up lest another be scandalized. But among spiritual 
goods there are some which are necessary for salvation, which cannot be 
aban<!--
Qu. XLIII. 7.] SCANDAL. 257 
 --><A NAME="p257"></a>doned without mortal sin. But it is manifest that no one ought to 
commit mortal sin in order to hinder another from doing wrong. In the 
order of charity man ought to place his own spiritual safety higher 
than another's. Things, therefore, which are necessary to salvation may 
not be left undone for the sake of avoiding scandal. <p>

But in the case of spiritual goods which are not necessary to 
salvation, we should distiuguish two kinds of scandal. For the scandal 
which arises from these sometimes springs from malice, when there are 
those who wish to hinder such spiritual goods by exciting scandals. 
Such were the Pharisees who were scandalized at our Lord's teachings 
(S. Matt. xv. 12). This sort of scandal the Lord taught us to treat 
with contempt. But sometimes the scandal comes from infirmity or 
ignorance, the scandal of the weak. On account of this, spiritual goods 
may be kept hidden or even sometimes deferred when there is no imminent 
spiritual danger in doing so, until, further explanation having been 
given, the scandal may cease. But if after such explanations it still 
endure, it may possibly seem to come from malice; if so, spiritual 
goods are not to be relinquished on account of it. <p>

(Note that argument may not put an end to scandal of the weak, however 
sound the argument may be. For the weak may be very weak in logic, or 
have their heads full of other arguments, with no room for more; or 
they may be so hardened in old habits that arguments run off from the 
surface of their minds, unable to enter any further.) <p>

(1) But S. Augustine teaches that the discipline of sins may sometimes 
be passed over if there be great danger of schism (Contra Epist. 
Parmen. ii.). So a spiritual good, an act of justice, would be 
neglected on account of scandal. But I reply that punishment is not to 
be sought on its own account, but penalties of Church discipline are 
medicinal, intended to prevent sins, and they are so far just as they 
have that tendency. But if, through enforcing Church discipline, 
<!--
258 VICES OPPOSED TO CHARITY. [Qu. XLIII. 7. 
--><A NAME="p258"></a>
 manifestly more and greater sins will follow, then the infliction of 
penalties will not come under the idea of justice. This is the case of 
which S. Augustine is speaking, where the excommunication of some will 
probably be followed by the schism of others. <p>

(2) But sacred truth is to be held back on account of scandal. "Give 
not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls 
before swine; lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again 
and rend you" (S. Matt. vii. 6). I reply that sacred truth and the 
teaching of it are here to be distinguished. That truth is so necessary 
to salvation that the contrary of it may under no circumstances be 
taught for fear of any scandal whatsoever which will follow the 
proclamation of the truth. But he whose duty it is to teach the truth 
will give it according to what fits the times and the persons. This 
teaching is one of those spiritual works of mercy of which we shall 
presently speak. <p>

(3) Fraternal correction, also, is intended for the amendment of a 
brother, and it is a spiritual good so far as this can be attained. But 
if he be scandalized by it, it is not a spiritual good. Therefore, if 
such fraternal correction be passed by through fear of scandal, a 
spiritual good is not given up. <p>

(4) But you may say that the giving of alms and the following of 
spiritual counsels may sometimes be left undone on account of scandal. 
I reply that counsels or works of mercy are not to be left undone on 
account of scandal, although, for the sake of the weak, they may be 
concealed or deferred. But sometimes the observance of spiritual 
counsels or the works of mercy may be necessary to salvation. There are 
those who have vowed to follow the counsels of perfection; there are 
those whose office and duty it is to assist the poor or to teach the 
ignorant; there are cases occurring of extreme necessity in all such 
cases the principle already laid down respecting what is necessary to 
sal<!--
Qu. XLIII. 8.] SCANDAL. 259 
 --><A NAME="p259"></a>vation applies; they may not be neglected through fear of scandal. <p>

(5) But ought not one to commit some trifling venial transgression on 
account of some grave scandal -- say, to hinder another's mortal sin? 
For a man ought to hinder the damnation of his neighbour, if he can do 
so without loss of his own soul. <p>

But there is contradiction in these terms. For if the thing may be 
lawfully done, it is not evil, it is not even venial sin; for sin can 
never be rightly chosen. I grant, however, that it may happen that 
something which would be venial sin under other circumstances, may be 
no sin at all, those circumstances not being present. A jest is venial 
sin under certain circumstances, but if it be uttered for reasonable 
cause it is not an idle word, it is no sin.  <p>

<i>Are temporal goods to be given up on account of scandal?</i><p>

Observe that a distinction must be made between what is our own and 
what is entrusted to our care, if we are guardians of Church property 
or of the goods of the commonwealth (or trustees of minors, etc.). Such 
deposits we are bound to preserve, and they are not to be resigned on 
account of scandal; neither are those things which are necessary for 
human life to be given up. But as respects those things over which we 
have dominion, sometimes on account of scandal we ought to let them go 
by giving them up, or not seeking them when others have them, and 
sometimes we ought not to do any such thing. For if the scandal arise 
from the ignorance or infirmity of others (scandal of the weak), 
temporal goods are to be abandoned, or the scandal is to be stopped by 
proper admonition. <p>

But sometimes scandal originates in malice (the scandal of Pharisees). 
Property is not to be surrendered on account of those who excite such 
scandal, because such a course would be injurious to the common good, 
giving occasion for robbery to the evil-disposed; and it would be 
injurious 
<!--
260 VICES OPPOSED TO CHARITY. [Qu. XLIII. 8. 
--><A NAME="p260"></a>
 to the plunderers themselves, who, by keeping others' goods, would 
continue in open sin. <p>

(1) It is true that we ought to prefer the spiritual salvation of our 
neighbour to any earthly goods; but this principle can only apply to 
scandal of the weak. <p>

(2) When S. Paul said: "Destroy not with thy meat him for whom Christ 
died" (1 Rom. xiv. 15), he was speaking, of course, of what is not 
necessary for bodily sustenance; as again in 1 Cor. viii. 13: "If meat 
maketh my brother to stumble, I will eat no flesh for evermore, that I 
make not my brother to stumble." <p>

(3) Our Lord (S. Matt. v. 40) said: "If any man would go to law with 
thee, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloak also." And S. Paul 
to the same effect (1 Cor. vi. 7). But this is said of preparedness of 
soul when such a course is expedient; but sometimes it is not 
expedient.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<a name="n_3"><a href="#n3">{3}</a></a> If there is a question of positive duty, or of grave injury to self 
or to others, passive scandal may be permitted. But distinguish between 
moral precepts, including the law of nature, and purely positive law. 
The former may not he broken in order to avoid scandal; the latter may 
be freely suspended by the higher law of charity. <p>

It is not the sin of scandal to permit a sin in order to hinder many 
sins; <i>e.g.</i>, the theft of a child or a servant permitted in order 
to detect and stop pilfering, or a marked letter or coin for a similar 
purpose. <p>
