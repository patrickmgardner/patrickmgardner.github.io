<h2>PART II. -- THEOLOGICAL VIRTUES.</h2><p>

<h3>CHAPTER I.  FAITH AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Faith.</h4><p>

<i>In order to consider rightly the virtue of faith, we must inquire 
first into its object, then into the act of faith itself.</i><p>

Faith assents to nothing except as revealed by God, and because it has 
been revealed by God. Therefore it rests on the primal verity, on God. 
This is faith's "formal" part, the essence of faith. But if we consider 
the things which are received by faith, the "material" part, not only 
God's existence but many other things also are believed, which, 
however, do not fall under the assent of faith, except related to God. 
In both ways, then, the object of faith is primal verity (either God 
Himself, or the Divine veracity in revelation).  <p>

<i>Is the object of faith things or propositions?</i><p>

Things known are in the knower after his proper manner. Now the proper 
mode of human intelligence is through propositions which analyze or 
synthesize. So, then, the object of faith also can be considered in two 
ways; one, on the side of the thing believed, and so the object of 
faith is the very thing (or being) concerned; another, on the part of 
the believer, and so the object of his faith is some inward proposition 
of his mind. But the act of faith is not ter<!--
154 FAITH AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. x.3, 4. 
 --><A NAME="p154"></a>minated in the proposition, but in the thing (or being) which is 
the object of the proposition. And thus we say, "I believe in God the 
Father Almighty."  <p>

<i>Can the false be the object of faith?</i><p>

No; for nothing can be embraced in the faith which does not stand under 
that primal verity which is its "formal" object. <p>

(1) Truth is the good of intelligence; therefore all the virtues which 
perfect it, and chiefly faith, totally exclude the false. Hope and 
charity may in a certain way be deceived, but these perfect the will, 
whose good is a different good from that of intelligence. <p>

(2) Human conjectures may be attached to the object of faith, and may 
err, but this is not error in the faith.  <p>

<i>Faith is "the proving of things not seen" (Heb. xi. 1).</i><p>

Faith signifies the assent of the mind to that which is believed. But 
that assent is given, first, when the mind is moved to it by the object 
itself, which is either known <i>per se -- sc.</i>, primary self-evident
 truths -- or known through another object, the necessary inference or 
conclusion of scientific knowledge. But that assent is given also, 
secondly, not because the intellect is sufficiently moved by its proper 
object, hut because through some choice the mind voluntarily inclines 
to one side rather than to the other. And if indeed this is done with 
hesitation and fear of the other side, it will be opinion; but if with 
unhesitating certitude, it will be faith. But the things which, <i>per 
se</i>, move our intelligence to know them, are seen by the senses, or 
by the mind. Hence it is manifest that neither faith nor opinion can be 
of things seen by sense or by the intellect. A thing may he seen to be 
credible, to harmonize with the habit of spiritual faith, and so on; 
but this is not literally seeing with the mind the object of faith. 
<!--
Qu. II. 1.] THE INWARD ACT OF FAITH. 155  
--><A NAME="p155"></a><p>

<i>Can those things which are of faith be known or demonstrated?</i><p>

All knowledge comes through principles known <i>per se; i.e.</i>, they 
are seen. And, therefore, whatever things are known, in some way are 
seen. But the same thing cannot at the same time, and by the same 
person, be known and believed. Still it can happen that what is seen 
and known by one, may be believed by another. "Now we see through a 
glass darkly, but then face to face" (1 Cor. xiii. 12). What we 
believe, the saints see and know. The same thing may be true in this 
present state of life. But that which is proposed to all men in general 
to be believed, is in general not known; it is simply the object of 
faith. <p>

(1) This is not the ignorance of unbelief; but through the light of 
faith, not through demonstration, the faithful see what they are to 
believe. <p>

(2) As science demonstrates its conclusions, so the truth of the faith 
is argued in two ways; one, not demonstrative but persuasive argument, 
showing that the things believed are not impossible; another, deducing 
the articles of faith from the Holy Scriptures, the foundations of the 
faith. <p>

(3) Some things are believed which philosophy undertakes to 
demonstrate, as the being and unity of God, etc. But these are numbered 
with the articles of the faith, both because they are preambles of the 
faith, and because where they are not demonstratively known they must 
at least be believed.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup>  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. The inward act of faith.</h4><p>

<i>What is it to believe?</i><p>

If we say that it is thinking with assent, we shall need to examine our 
terms. What is it to think? (1) Any consideration of a thing by the mind 
may be called so; and 
<!--
156 FAITH AND ITS OPPOStTE VICES. [Qu. II. 2. 
--><A NAME="p156"></a>
 he who considers the things which he knows does so with assent to 
them. But this is not belief. (2) It may mean a consideration of some 
subject with inquiry into it, before there is perfect insight into it. 
This is an act of the deliberating intellect. Now there are acts 
pertaining to the intelligence in which, without further reflection, 
there is firm assent, as when one considers what he already knows or 
sees to be true. And there are acts of intelligence also in which there 
is a thought without firm assent, inclining sometimes to neither side, 
as in doubt; or to one side through some trifling indication, as in 
suspicion; or adhering to one side with fear of the opposite, as in 
opinion. But in belief there is firm adhesion to one side, and so far 
it agrees with knowledge and intellectual insight; and yet there is not 
perfect knowledge through clear insight, and so far it agrees with 
doubt, suspicion, and opinion. And so this mental reflection with 
assent, is peculiar to belief. <p>

But the inquiry is not into direct demonstration of the things which 
are believed, but into the reasons for believing, say, that they have 
been spoken by God, are confirmed by miracles, etc., etc. <p>

Assent may also be said to be the act of will, because the mind of him 
that believes is determined to one proposition, not by reasoning but by 
his will. So assent as here used signifies the act of the intelligence, 
as it is determined by the will to one thing. (The reason why the will 
assents to what the mind does not see, is because God has said it.)  <p>

<i>There are three acts of faith in relation to its object.</i><p>

For since believing pertains to the intellect as it is moved to assent 
by the will, the object of faith may be viewed either on the 
intellectuai side of the act, or on the side of the will moving the 
intellect. If the first, we may consider the very thing believed, the 
"material" object of faith. This is God. For nothing is proposed to 
faith, except as it pertains to God. This is <i>"credere Deum"</i> 
(believing that God 
<!--
Qu. II. 3.] THE INWARD ACT OF FAITH. 157 
--><A NAME="p157"></a>
 is). Or we may consider why the assent is given, the "formal" part of 
the object. And this is primal verity, to which man adheres, on account 
of it assenting to what he believes. This is <i>credere Deo</i> 
(believing what God says). But we may consider, thirdly, the object of 
faith, as the reason is moved by the will. So viewed, the act of faith 
is <i>credere in Deum</i> (to tend to God as the ultimate end on 
account of whom we will to believe). <p>

The unbeliever, indeed, may admit that God exists; but he does not 
believe it under those conditions which faith determines.  <p>

<i>Is it necessary to salvation to believe anything which is above 
natural reason?</i><p>

Rational nature alone has immediate relation to God. Its perfection 
requires not only what naturally belongs to it, but what is given to it 
through a certain supernatural participation of the Divine goodness. 
Hence the ultimate beatitude of man consists in the supernatural vision 
of God. (See page 4.) To this man can attain only as he is taught of 
God (S. John vi. 45). But this discipline is not instantaneous, but 
gradual, according to the laws of man's nature. But every one who is 
taught must believe in order to reach perfect knowledge. Hence if man 
would attain his perfect beatitude, he must believe his teacher, God. <p>

(1) The things to be believed exceed natural reason, because the nature 
of man depends on a higher nature. <p>

(2) It is true that man cannot judge of what is proposed to his faith, 
by referring it to those primary truths through which we judge of all 
things besides. But there is no risk of illusion in this. For as by the 
natural light of reason man assents to principles, and as a virtuous 
man through his habit of virtue has right judgment respecting those 
things which harmonize with his virtue, so, by the light of faith 
divinely infused, man assents to those things which are of faith, but 
not to their contraries. 
<!--
158 FAITH AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. I. 4, 5.  
--><A NAME="p158"></a><p>

<i>Is it necessary to believe those things which can be proved by 
natural reason -- e.g., that God is one and a Spirit?</i><p>

Yes; and for three reasons: (1) that man may more speedily arrive at 
the knowledge of Divine truth. For the science to which it appertains 
to prove that God exists and other such truths respecting Him, is the 
last to be acquired by men, many other sciences being presupposed. And 
so man would arrive at the knowledge of God only at a late period of 
life. <p>

(2) There is the same necessity of belief in order that the knowledge 
of God may be more widely diffused. For many are too dull of 
understanding, or too much Occupied, or too sluggish of will to acquire 
this science (philosophy), and they would altogether be deprived of the 
knowledge of God, if it were not offered to them through faith. <p>

(3) There is the same necessity of belief in order that there may be 
certitude. For humau reason is very defective in Divine things, and 
even about human affairs philosophers have widely differed, and many 
have erred. In order, therefore, that there might be unhesitating 
certitude respecting God, Divine things (even those which might be 
proved) Were delivered to faith as spoken by God.  <p>

<i>Man is bound to believe explicitly all the articles of iliefaith, 
and implicitly whatsoevej. is contained in the holy Scriptures.</i><p>

"He that cometh to God, must believe that He is, and that He is a 
rewarder of them that seek after Him" (Heb. xi. 6). For the 
determination of the act of any virtue to its proper and <i>per se</i> 
object is part of the command, like the act of the virtue itself. And 
the object of faith, <i>per se</i>, is that by which man is rendered 
blessed. <p>

But the determination of the virtuous act to things which are 
accidentally or secondarily related to its proper object is not 
commanded except under the suitable conditions of place and time. And 
thus man is bound implicitly or in preparation of soul to believe 
whatever the Divine Scriptures contain. (The argument seems to 
require, as 
<!--
Qu. II. 9.] THE INWARD ACT OF FAITH. 159 
--><A NAME="p159"></a>
 qualification, the contents of Holy Scriptures as connected with the 
primary object of faith. It may not be possible to draw the line of 
division, but if, beside the Divine element in Holy Scriptures, there 
is a human element -- say, numbers, names, and the like -- the argument 
hardly seems to reach to that; in fact, that element was probably not 
in the mind of the saint at all.) <p>

(1) But how can a man be bound to that which is not in his power? "how 
shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard?" (Rom. x. 14). 
Man is bound to many things which he cannot reach without assisting 
grace, as, to love God and his neighbour. <p>

(2) But the good of faith consists in obedience (Rom. i. 5), and the 
virtue of obedience does not require that one observe any determinate 
precepts, but it suffices that he have a ready mind (Ps. cxix. 60). 
Therefore it seems to suffice for faith that one have a ready mind to 
whatever may be Divinely proposed, without explicitly believing 
anything. <p>

But I answer that the virtue of obedience is properly in the will, and, 
therefore, to the act of obedience (act to the act of faith which is in 
the intellect) it suffices that there be a promptitude of will subject 
to the one who commands; and this is properly and <i>per se</i> the 
object of obedience.  <p>

Faith is a meritorious act, (in the sense in which we speak of virtuous 
acts as being meritorious; see p. 42). "Through faith" the saints of 
old time "obtained promises" (Heb. xi. 33). This could not be if their 
faith had no merit.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Observe, then, that our acts obtain reward, are 
meritorious, in so far as they proceed from free-will moved by the 
grace of God. Hence, every human act which is under free-will can be 
meritorious if it is referred
<!--
160 FAITH AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. II. 10. 
--><A NAME="p160"></a>
 to God. But faith is the act of the intellect assenting to Divine 
truth at the command of the will which is moved by the grace of God. 
Therefore it can he meritorious. <p>

(1) Charity indeed is the principle of merit. But nature and faith are 
precedent to charity; nature, as the matter in which charity is found; 
faith (<i>fides informis</i>), as a precedent disposition. But when 
charity is come, nature and faith act in virtue of that (<i>fides 
formata</i>), and so neither nature nor faith can produce a meritorious 
act without charity; but charity supervening, the act of faith is 
rendered meritorious by it, as is the act of nature and the natural 
act of free-will. <p>

(2) Even in knowledge something of a similar kind may be found. For 
while assent is compelled by the cogency of demonstration, and is 
neither subject to free-will nor is meritorious, yet the actual 
consideration of the thing in question is so subject, since it is in a 
man's power to consider or not to consider. And so the considering may 
be meritorious if it be referred to the end of charity; <i>i.e.</i>, to 
the honour of God or the good of our neighbour. <p>

(3) A superficial objection says that if a man assent to anything with 
faith, he either has sufficient reason leading him to believe, or he 
has not. If he has, his faith is not meritorious, because he is not 
free to believe or disbelieve. If he has not, he shows empty credulity. 
Either way there is no merit in the ease. But I reply that he who 
believes has sufficient motive for doing so, since he is led by the 
authority of Divine doctrine confirmed by miracles, and, which is more, 
by the inward drawing of God Himself. Hence, faith is not credulity. 
But still there is none of the compulsion of demonstration, and merit 
is not taken away.  <p>

<i>Do credible arguments for the faith diminish the merit of that 
virtue?</i><p>

Reason may precede the will in believing -- say, when one 
<!--
Qu. III. 2.] THE OUTWARD ACT OF FAITH. 161 
--><A NAME="p161"></a>
 either would not have a believing will, or not so prompt a one, if 
human reasons had not led up to faith; and so they diminish the merit 
of faith, for we ought to believe, not on account of human arguments, 
but of Divine authority. (Of course, in point of time motives for 
believing must precede, if we would not fall into mere credulity. But 
the author is speaking of the cause, the reason of assent.) In another 
way reason may follow the will of him who believes; for when a man has 
a will prompt to believe, he loves the verity which he believes, and he 
reflects upon it, and delights in finding reasons for it. This does not 
detract from faith, but rather increases its merit.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. The outward act of faith.</h4><p>

<i>Spoken words are ordained to signify what is conceived in the heart; 
and outward confession of the faith is an external act of faith.</i><p>

Is it necessary to salvation? The apostle says, "With the mouth 
confession is made unto salvation." But this confession as an 
affirmative act can fall only under an affirmative precept. It is 
necessary to salvation after the manner of other affirmative commands. 
Now, these are of perpetual obligation, but not at all times 
(<i>"semper, non ad semper"</i>). But they bind in certain times and 
places according to due circumstances, in accordance with which the 
human act must be limited in order to make it an act of virtue. So, 
then, confession of the faith at all times and in every place is not 
essential to salvation, but confession in some place and time is so; 
when, <i>sc.</i>, through omission of this confession honour due to God 
would be withheld, and even the benefit of our neighbour criminally 
neglected; say, if one who is asked respecting his faith should keep 
silence, and so should be taken for an unbeliever, or others should be 
turned away from the faith through his silence. <p>

(1) But cannot our hearts cleave to Divine truth without speaking of 
what we believe? I answer that the end of 
<!--
162 FAITH AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. XV. 1. 
--><A NAME="p162"></a>
 faith, as of other virtues, must be referred to charity, the love of 
God and of our neighbour. Now, when the honour of God or the utility of 
our neighbour demands this confession, a man ought not to he content to 
possess Divine truth through his faith, but ought to declare it with 
his lips. <p>

But apart from any benefit to the faith or to the faithful, it is not 
laudable to proclaim one's faith if tumult among unbelievers is the 
result. If good is reasonably hoped for, let the disturbance be 
despised.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. The virtue of faith.</h4><p>

<i>What is the virtue of faith?</i><p>

If we consider the apostle's description (Heb. xi. 1), we shall see 
that it contains all that is essential to definition. "Faith is the 
substance of things hoped for, the proof of things not seen." Primal 
verity is the end and object of this theological virtue, verity not 
seen as yet. And so it is spoken of as "hoped for." For to see the 
truth is to possess it. But no one hopes for that which he already 
has, but for that which he has not. So, then, the relation of the act 
of faith to its end, which is the object of the will, is expressed thus 
"the substance of things hoped for." Substance here means the beginning 
of a thing when all that follows is virtually contained in its 
beginning. So we may say that primary indemonstrable principles are the 
substance of science, because they are first in logical order, and 
virtually contain all science. This is likewise true of faith, because 
the first beginnings of the things hoped for are in us through the 
assent of faith, which virtually contains all the things hoped for. For 
we hope to be blessed in seeing face to face the truth to which we 
adhere through faith. But the relation, secondly, of the act of faith 
to the object of the intelligence, as it is object of faith, is next 
described, viz., "the proof of things not seen." Proof is here taken 
for the effect of proof. Faith is thus distin<!--
Qu. XV. 2, 3.] THE VIRTUE OF FAITH. 163 
 --><A NAME="p163"></a>guished from all other things which pertain to the mind. 
"Proof" or evidence distinguishes it from opinion, suspicion, and 
doubt, in which there is no firm adhesion of the mind to anything. 
"Things not seen" distinguishes it from knowledge and understanding. 
And, finally. "the substance of things hoped for" distinguishes the 
virtue of faith, from faith in general, which is not ordained for the 
beatitude hoped for. We say, "the things hoped for," not "the things 
loved," for love may be of things seen, which cannot be the object of 
faith. Note, too, that evidence from the proper principles of the thing 
makes it to be (inwardly) seen; not so the proof from Divine authority 
(except in a common figure of speech).  <p>

<i>Faith is primarily a virtue of the speculative intellect.</i><p>

For believing is primarily an act of the intellect, because the object 
of this act is the true, which properly pertains to the intellect. And 
therefore it is necessary that faith, which is the proper principle of 
this act, be there also. To faith succeeds vision; "now we see through 
a glass darkly, but then face to face." But vision is in the intellect, 
therefore faith also is. The act of faith, indeed, as we have seen, 
proceeds from will also which moves to assent. Therefore both powers 
must be perfected by their respective habits, in order that the act of 
faith may be perfect in its kind.  <p>

<i>Living faith.</i><p>

The object of the will is the good, and the act of faith, as we have 
just seen, is ordained for this end. But this Divine good, which is the 
end of faith, is the proper object of charity. Therefore by charity the 
act of faith is perfected and "informed" (<i>fides formata</i>). Faith 
works through love. <p>

Dead faith and living faith are one so far as intellect is concerned; 
but what distinguishes living faith is found in the will; <i>i.e.</i>, 
the grace of charity. <p>

<i>Fides formata</i> is a virtue, for "we are justified by faith" 
<!--
164 FAITH AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. IV. 8. 
--><A NAME="p164"></a>
 (Rom. v. 1). Since believing is the act of the mind assenting to the 
true under the command of the will, in order that the act may be 
perfect (<i>i.e.</i>, proceed from virtue), two things are required: 
first, that the mind infallibly tend to the true; next, that the will 
be infallibly ordered with respect to the ultimate end on account of 
which that assent is given. Both of these are found in the act of 
<i>fides formata</i>. For, first, faith is directed to the true, since 
the false cannot be the object of true faith (see page 154) next, 
charity by which faith is "informed" (rendered living) directs the will 
to the good end. <p>

But dead faith is not a virtue, since it lacks the due perfection on 
the part of the will.  <p>

<i>Why is faith first among virtues (in order of generation)?</i><p>

Since, in things which are to be done, the end is their first 
principle, necessarily the theological virtues, which have as their 
object the ultimate end, are prior to other virtues (if we speak of the 
perfect virtues). But the ultimate end itself must be in the 
intelligence before it is in the will, because nothing can be willed 
which is not previously cognized, apprehended by the mind. Hence, since 
the ultimate end is in the will, indeed, through hope and love, but in 
the intellect through faith, the latter is necessarily first among 
virtues. <i>Per accidens</i>, however, other imperfect virtues may 
prepare the way for faith, as humility may remove the pride which makes 
the reason refuse to submit itself to the verities of the faith. <p>

Charity is the foundation of the spiritual edifice (Col. iii. 14), 
which binds all parts of it together; but this does not make it first 
in order of generation.  <p>

<i>Is faith more certain than knowledge (scientia) and the other 
intellectual virtues?</i><p>

Wisdom, knowledge, and understanding, the three intel<!--
165 Qu. iv. 8.] THE VIRTUE OF FAITH. 
 --><A NAME="p165"></a>lectual virtues which concern necessary truth, resemble faith in 
this, and are thus distinguished from prudence, which concerns 
contingent truths. The question before us plainly regards the three 
first, since prudence cannot have the same certitude in its object. 
Observe, also, that the same three names are applied to three of the 
seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. If, now, we speak of the three 
intellectual virtues as compared with faith, certitude is of two sorts: 
one depending on the cause of certitude. That is more certain which has 
the more certain cause. In this way faith is more certain 
(objectively), because it rests on Divine veracity; but the three 
intellectual virtues rest on human reason. But certitude may be viewed 
(subjectively) on the side of the one who has it, and so that is said 
to be more certain which the mind of man more fully attains to; and, 
in this way, since the things of faith are above human understanding, 
but the objects of the aforesaid virtues are not, faith, on this side, 
is less certain. (Not that one adheres less firmly to the first, but 
the mind cannot rest with an intellectual intuition of the truth beyond 
the reach of disturbing doubt.) <p>

But if we speak of the gifts, faith is their principle, and is 
presupposed, which renders faith more certain than they. <p>

(1) There can be no doubt in the three intellectual virtues, as there 
can be in the believing soul. But then this doubt is not on the side of 
the cause of faith, but in ourselves, as understanding does not fully 
attain to the objects of faith. <p>

(2) <i>Caeteris paribus</i>, sight is more certain than hearing, and 
faith comes by hearing (Rom. x. 17). So that it might seem as if faith 
had less certainty than the intellectual virtues have. But if he from 
whom we hear far exceeds us in power of sight, then hearing may he more 
certain than sight. A "layman" in science is apt to have more certainty 
from what scientific people tell him than from his own unassisted 
observations. And so man is more certain of what he hears 
<!--
166 FAITH AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. V. 3. 
--><A NAME="p166"></a>
 from God, who cannot be deceived, than of what he sees by the light of 
his own reason (I Thess. ii. 13). <p>

(3) Understanding is more perfect than faith, because through faith we 
arrive at understanding. But this greater manifestation in 
understanding and knowledge does not imply a more fixed adherence and 
certitude, because all their certitude as spiritual gifts proceeds from 
the certitude of faith. And, as intellectual virtues, they rest on the 
natural light of reason, which falls short in certitude from the Word 
of God on which faith rests.  <p>

Can he who disbelieves one article of the faith have dead faith 
(<i>fides informis</i>) in the other articles? <p>

In the heretic who rejects one article of the faith remains neither 
living nor dead faith. The formal object of virtue being taken away -- 
<i>i.e.</i>, what makes it virtue -- the virtue is destroyed. But the 
formal object of faith is primal truth as manifested in the holy 
Scriptures, and in the teaching of the Church which proceeds from the 
primal verity manifested in those Holy Scriptures. Hence he who does 
not adhere to the doctrine of the Church as an infallible and Divine 
rule, has not the habit of faith, and if he hold anything which agrees 
with articles of the faith, he does not hold it through faith, but in 
some other way. So a man may hold a scientific conclusion; hut if he 
have no scientific proof of it, it is his opinion, and it is not 
science. <p>

But he who adheres to the teaching of the Church as to an infallible 
rule, assents to all which the Church teaches. But if he holds what he 
likes of Church teaching, and what he does not will to hold he does not 
hold, he adheres to his own will, not to the doctrine of the Church. 
Hence it is manifest that the heretic who pertinaciously rejects one 
article of the faith is not prepared to follow the teaching of the 
Church. If this is not pertinaciously done, he is not a heretic, but is 
merely in error. But it is manifest that the heretic concerning one 
article of the faith has not faith 
<!--
Qu. vi. 1.] THE VIRTUE OF FAITH. 167  
--><A NAME="p167"></a>
 respecting the other articles, but only some opinion according to his 
own self-will. <p>

(There is only one mode of approach for all articles of the faith. In 
wilfully rejecting that mode of approach for one, it is virtually 
rejected for all.) <p>

He who has faith is prepared to believe explicitly all that is 
contained under it, but one may explicitly believe more than another. 
And, also, one may adhere to primal verity with more certitude than 
another, with more firmness, promptitude, devotion, or confidence.  <p>

<i>Is faith acquired, or is it infused by God?</i><p>

There are two requisites for faith; one, that credible things (things 
to be believed) be presented to man, in order that he may explicitly 
believe something; the other, assent of the believer to the things so 
presented. As regards the first, faith is necessarily from God, for the 
articles of faith exceed human reason, and so do not fall under man's 
cognition unless God reveal them; to some immediately -- <i>e.g.</i>, 
apostles and prophets; to others through the medium of preaching the 
Gospel (Rom. x. 15). <p>

But as regards assent, we may find two causes, one outward, like 
miracles seen or the persuasive preaching of men; neither of which is 
sufficient, for one man believes, and another does not. Therefore, it 
is necessary to recognize another inward cause, which moves a man 
inwardly to assent to the things of faith. This cause is not man's 
freewill, as the Pelagians vainly talk, because in this assent man is 
raised above himself, and so there must be an inward supernatural cause 
moving him, which is God. <p>

Faith, indeed, comes by hearing, and it is voluntary, but the hearing 
is only of what is to be believed (not the cause of belief in it); and 
the will must be prepared by grace in order that it may be raised to 
what is above nature. (Eph. ii. 8): "By grace have ye been saved 
through faith; and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God." 
<!--
168 FAITH AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. x. 1.  
--><A NAME="p168"></a><p>

<i>The effects of faith</i><p>

are, from dead faith servile fear; from living faith filial, 
reverential fear; purification of the soul from error by dead faith; 
from all impurity by faith informed by love. <p>

To the virtue of faith correspond the spiritual gifts of understanding 
and knowledge (qu's. viii. and ix.). The first is a supernatural light 
which man needs in order that he may penetrate further in knowing what 
he could not know by natural light. Not that the very same things 
believed by faith are understood through the gift; but things connected 
with the faith are better understood, though imperfectly, but yet 
enough to know that apparent difficulties are no good reason for 
departing from the faith. This gift is bestowed only on those who have 
already received justifying grace, <i>"gratia gratum faciens,"</i> and 
clearer light is thrown on the objects of faith, making more explicit 
what is believed. <p>

(2) Knowledge is a second gift, because the faithful needs for perfect 
assent of faith to what is revealed not only a clear insight of 
understanding, but also, in order that he may not err in his belief, a 
certain and right judgment, distinguishing what is of faith from what 
is not. This is not discursive or argumentative, but direct and simple. 
This definition of the gift of knowledge would lead us also to the gift 
of wisdom; but we may make the distinction that the latter has 
reference to Divine things as such; the former considers human things 
as connected with the faith. It knows what is to be believed on the 
earthly side of heavenly things.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 5. Infidelity, heresy, apostasy, and blasphemy</h4> <p>

<i>Is unbelief a sin?</i><p>

There is an unbelief which is purely negative, the mere absence of 
positive faith. So viewed in those who have never heard of the faith, 
it is not sin, but rather the pen<!--
Qu. X. 2, 3.] INFIDELITY. 169  
 --><A NAME="p169"></a>alty of sin, because such ignorance of Divine things is the fruit 
of our first parents' sin. Such infidels, if they are condemned, are 
condemned not on account of their infidelity, but because of other sins 
which cannot be remitted without faith (S. John xv. 22). <p>

But there is also (a privative infidelity) an infidelity of 
contradiction, by which one resists or even despises the hearing of 
faith (Isa. liii. 1). This is perfect infidelity and is mortal sin (S. 
John iii. 18). <p>

(1) As every sin is against nature, so, although supernatural faith is 
not in human nature, yet that the mind of man should not resist its 
inward promptings and the outward preaching of the truth is certainly 
natural. <p>

(2) If you say that no one sins in what he cannot avoid, and therefore 
unbelief is no sin, you are speaking of purely negative unbelief. <p>

(3) Infidelity proper may be traced to the capital sin of pride, 
through which a man is unwilling to subject his intellect to a creed as 
the rule of faith (and to the teaching of a Church composed of fallible 
men like himself, no wiser, if so wise and learned, etc.).  <p>

<i>Infidelity is a sin of the intellect.</i><p>

Every sin, indeed, is in the (depraved) will, which commands all the 
acts of sin; for every sin is voluntary. But sin has also its proper 
and proximate principle, which elicits the act of sin, as gluttony and 
lust are found in the concupiscible soul. But dissent, like assent, is 
the act of the mind as moved by the will. Therefore unbelief, like 
faith, has the intellect for its proximate subject, but the will as its 
prime mover. Contempt of the word preached, for example, has its cause 
in the will, but the unbelief produced is in the intellect.  <p>

<i>Is unbelief the greatest of sins?</i><p>

Since the essence of all sin is aversion from God, any sin 
<!--
170 FAITH AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. x. 4. 
--><A NAME="p170"></a>
 is graver the more man through it is separated from God. But this is 
especially true of unbelief, since true knowledge of God is rejected; 
but by falsehood respecting Him, one does not draw near to Him, but 
rather removes self from Him. The unbeliever's false opinion is not God 
at all. Thus it is manifest that infidelity is worse than sins which 
consist in perverse morality. It is otherwise with sins which are 
opposed to the theological virtues. (See page 180.) <p>

(1) It does not follow that the unbelief of a heretic is worse than the 
immorality of a Catholic Christian, for what is worse in kind may be 
rendered lighter by palliating circumstances, as also the sin of a 
Catholic may be aggravated by the circumstances of it. <p>

(2) Although infidelity is wilful opposition to the faith, yet it may 
be joined with ignorance, which palliates it, especially when one, like 
Saul, the persecutor, does not sin from malice (1 Tim. i. 13). <p>

(3) It is true, also, that sorer punishment falls on the faithful for 
their sins than on infidels (Heb. x. 29); but infidelity as sin may, 
nevertheless, deserve heavier punishment than any one sin of another 
kind. But the believer sins more gravely in any offence, <i>caeteris 
paribus</i>, than the unbeliever, both because of his greater knowledge 
of the truth derived from the faith, and because he has received the 
sacraments of faith, which through his sin he tramples under foot.  <p>

<i>Is every action of the unbeliever sinful?</i><p>

We have seen that mortal sin takes away justifying grace (<i>"gratia 
gratum faciens"</i>) (see pages 110, 115). but it does not totally 
corrupt the good of nature. Hence, since infidelity is a mortal sin, 
the infidel has not that grace, but natural good still remains in him. 
It is plain, then, that infidels cannot do those meritorious works 
which come from grace, but, in some way, they may do those good actions 
for 
<!--
Qu. xi.] HERESY. 171 
--><A NAME="p171"></a>
 which nature is sufficient. It is not necessary, then, that they sin 
in whatever they may do. But whensoever anything is done from unbelief, 
then they sin. For as one who has faith can commit some sin in an act 
which he does not refer to the end of his faith, so also the infidel 
can do some good act in that which he does not refer to the end of his 
unbelief. <p>

Faith, indeed, directs the intention with respect to the supernatural 
end, but the light of natural reason can direct the intention with 
iespect to some connatural good.  <p>

<i>Heresy: is it a species of infidelity?</i><p>

He who rightly holds the Christian faith, of his own will assents to 
Christ in those things which truly pertain to his doctrine; and any one 
can deviate from the rectitude of Christian faith by refusing to assent 
to Christ. Such an one has an evil will respecting the end itself. This 
is the infidelity of those who reject the Church altogether, as heathen 
and Jews. Or, in another way, one may intend indeed to assent to 
Christ, but fail in choosing those things in which the assent is given. 
Heresy is this evil choice. The heretic does not choose those things 
which are truly delivered by Christ, but those which his own mind 
suggests to him. Therefore heresy is a species of infidelity pertaining 
to those who profess the faith of Christ, but corrupt its dogmas. (It 
may be defined as "pertinacious error manifestly repugnant to the 
faith, in him who has professed that faith in its verity.") <p>

It is counted among the works of the flesh (Gal. v. 19), by reason of 
its remote cause, which is pride, cupidity, etc., the desire of some 
wrong end. <p>

This evil choice may be made in what directly and principally pertains 
to the faith, as the articles of the Christian creed; or indirectly 
and secondarily, in those things from which follows the corruption of 
any article. <p>

Not all differences among theologians are to be called 
<!--
172 FAITH AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. xiii. 1, 2. 
--><A NAME="p172"></a>
 heretical, because, as S. Augustine says (Ep. 48), "If any one defend 
his judgment, although it be false and perverted, without pertinacious 
obstinacy, and seek the truth with careful solicitude, ready to be 
corrected (by it) when he shall have found it, by no means is he to be 
counted among heretics," because he makes no choice contradicting the 
doctrine of the Church. Differences, then, which are not heretical may 
concern those things which will not affect the faith whichever way they 
are decided (<i>e.g.</i>, the historical or scientific value of the Holy 
Scriptures), or those things which, though they are connected with the 
faith, have never been determined by the Church. <p>

(Articles against toleration of infidels and heretics are omitted.)  <p>

<i>Apostasy.</i><p>

It is an aggravated form of infidelity, since it is a departure from, 
a casting off of, the faith after it has been received (2 Pet. ii. 21). <p>

<i>Blasphemy: what is it?</i><p>

Whoever denies of God anything which belongs to Him, or asserts 
respecting God that which does not belong to Him, derogates from the 
Divine goodness, for He is the very essence of goodness, and whatever, 
therefore, belongs to Him, pertains to His goodness. But this 
derogation from the Divine goodness may be only in the intellect, or it 
may be also accompanied by a certain detestation in the affections 
(which constitutes the perfect sin of blasphemy). If this is found in 
the heart only, it is blasphemy of the heart; if it is also uttered, 
it is blasphemy of the lips. <p>

It is a mortal sin, because it is repugnant to Divine charity, inasmuch 
as it is derogatory to the Divine goodness which is the object of 
charity. <p>

It may be venial sin only when one does not observe that he is speaking 
blasphemy, in sudden heat bursting out in words whose significance he 
does not consider. 
<!--
Qu. xv. 173 BLASPHEMY. 
--><A NAME="p173"></a>
 But in itself it is aggravated infidelity, because a detestation of 
will is directed against the Divine honour. It is worse than homicide, 
because the latter is sin against our neighbour, but this is directly 
against God. Of course, if we speak of injurious effects, the case may 
be different, but the gravity of sin depends more upon the perversity 
of the will than on the effects of the action. <p>

The "sin against the Holy Ghost" takes various forms; but, in general, 
we may understand it as a casting off in contempt that which might have 
hindered the choice of evil, as hope is rejected through despair, and 
godly fear through presumption. But all these hindrances to the choice 
of evil are the effects of the Holy Ghost in us. And this malicious 
wickedness is sin against the Holy Ghost. There are six forms of it (1) 
despair, (2) presumption, (8) that impenitence which implies a purpose 
of remaining impenitent, (4) obstinate adherence to sin, (5) impugning 
of known truth in order that one may more freely sin, and (6) envy not 
only of a brother's prosperity but of the grace of God in him.  <p>

Spiritual blindness and dulness of heart are vices opposed to spiritual 
knowledge and understanding. <p>

Mental blindness is privation of the principle of mental vision. Now 
this principle is three-fold (1) The light of natural reason, of which 
the rational soul is never deprived, although it may be hindered from 
its proper activity through impediments in lower mental powers which 
the mind needs for thought. (Note this view of ordinary forms of 
insanity.) <p>

(2) Another principle of mental vision is an habitual light superadded 
to the natural light of reason, and this light indeed is sometimes 
taken away from the soul. This is penal blindness, the light of grace 
being taken away as the penalty of sin. <p>

(3) Another principle of mental vision is a certain men<!--
174 FAITH AND ITS OPPOSITE VICES. [Qu. xv. 2, 3. 
 --><A NAME="p174"></a>tal principle by which a man understands other things, at which 
principle the soul can aim, and is able not to aim. And this not aiming 
at it is due sometimes to a will spontaneously turning itself away from 
its consideration, of which the Psalmist speaks (Ps. xxxvi. 3). But 
sometimes, also, this blindness is due to mental preoccupation with 
things which are loved more, and this blindness of concupiscence, like 
the preceding, is sin. To understand the truth is, indeed, in itself 
agreeable to every one; but it may become hateful, if a man is 
hindered thereby from things which he more loves. <p>

Instead of absolute moral blindness, there may be a dulness of moral 
feeling in the consideration of spiritual goods, and both are opposed 
to that gift of spiritual understanding through which man apprehends 
and knows spiritual goods, and keenly penetrates into their deepest 
recesses. And this dulness of vision is sin just so far as it is 
directly or indirectly voluntary, as in him who, strongly affected 
towards carnal pleasures, feels disgust for spiritual things, or 
neglects them. <p>

These are especially the sinful fruits of fleshly sins, because the 
soul is most strongly drawn to that in which it finds the intensest 
pleasure, and consequently the mind is enfeebled with respect to 
spiritual things; while, on the other hand, the opposite virtues of 
abstinence and chastity especially dispose a man's soul for spiritual 
activity. And this is more or less true even of those who have a 
natural gift or an acquired habit of intellectual speculation. <p>
