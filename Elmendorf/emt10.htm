<h3>CHAPTER III.  CHARITY.</h3><p>

<h4>&sect; 1. Charity in general view.  What is charity?</h4><p>

The Lord said (S. John xv. 15), "No longer do I call you servants, but 
I have called you friends." This friendship is charity. Note the 
distinction between love of friendship, which is love of benevolence, 
when we so love any one that we wish for his good, and love of 
concupiscence, when we do not seek the good of the things loved, but 
seek their good for ourselves. Thus one may love wine, or a horse. For 
it is absurd to say that one has friendship for wine or for his horse 
(except by a sentimental personification). <p>

But benevolence alone is not sufficient for friendship; a certain 
mutual affection is requisite also; each loves the other (S. John xiv. 
21 "He that loveth Me, shall be loved by My Father, and I will love 
him"). But such mutual benevolence is founded on some fellowship. And 
such communion there is between man and God, according as He 
communicates His blessedness to us (1 Cor. i. 9). Love founded on this 
communion is charity, a certain friendship between man and God. <p>

(1) Charity is now imperfect, because although our spiritual 
"conversation is in heaven," yet it is very imperfect. <p>

(2) If this definition is correct, how, then, can one have charity for 
his enemies? I answer that friendship may extend to any one on his own 
account, in which way it can reach only our friends. But friendship may 
also extend itself to another in respect of some other person. If one 
loves 
<!--
186 CHARITY. [XXIII. 2. 
--><A NAME="p186"></a>
 another man, on account of that love he loves what pertains to him, as 
his children or servants. And the love of a friend can be so great, 
that for the sake of that friend those who pertain to him are loved 
even though they offend us or hate us. And after this manner the love 
of charity may extend even to enemies, whom out of charity we love in 
their relations to God, to whom is chiefly directed this love of 
charity. In this way it is possible that sinners be loved.  <p>

<i>Is charity an infused habit in the soul (or is it simply the operation 
of the Holy Ghost in and through the soul)?</i><p>

The motion of charity does not so proceed from the Holy Ghost moving 
the human soul that it is only moved and is in no way the principle of 
that motion, like an inanimate body propelled by external force. For 
that is contrary to the idea of the voluntary which has its principle 
in itself. For it would follow that loving is not voluntary, which 
implies contradiction, since love is essentially the act of the will. <p>

In like manner, also, it cannot be said that the Holy Spirit moves the 
will to love, as an instrument is moved, in which, although it is the 
principle of action, is not found the power to act and not to act. For 
so also would be taken away the idea of the voluntary, and the notion 
of merit would be excluded, which has its ground in charity. <p>

But if the will is moved to love by the Holy Ghost, still it is 
necessary that that will produce the act of love. But no act is 
perfectly produced by any active power unless it proceed also from some 
"connatural" habit which is the principle of that action. Hence God, 
who moves all things to their due ends, has given individual things 
their special nature (<i>forma</i>), by which they are inclined to the 
ends pre-appointed by Him. But it is manifest that the act of charity 
exceeds the natural power of the will. Unless, therefore, some thing 
(<i>forma</i>) be superadded to the natural power, through which it may 
be inclined to the act of 
<!--
Qu. xliii. 64 CHARITY IN GENERAL VIEW. 187
--><A NAME="p64"></a>
 love, that act would be more imperfect than natural acts and the acts 
of the other virtues, nor would it be easy and pleasurable. But this is 
manifestly not the case; for there is no other virtue which has such an 
inclination to its act as charity has, and none which acts so 
pleasurably. Hence it is most necessary for the act of charity that 
there be in us some habit superadded to the natural power, inclining it 
to the act of charity and making it to operate promptly and 
pleasurably.  <p>

<i>Charity is a special virtue, one virtue in all cases.</i><p>

Let us turn back. Human acts, as we have seen, are good according as 
they are regulated by due rule and measure. Therefore human virtue, 
which is the principle of all good acts, consists in attaining to that 
rule and measure, which, in the case of the moral virtues, is human 
reason, and, in every virtue, is God Himself. Hence, since charity 
attains to God because it unites us with God, it follows that it is a 
virtue. It is a special virtue, because, while the primal object of all 
love is the good, Divine good in itself, the object of beatitude is a 
special good and the love of this, which is charity, is a special love. 
And it is one in all cases, because the end, the Divine goodness, is 
one. Love of the brethren is a special application of this one charity, 
because they are loved on account of God, who is the principal object 
of the love of charity.  <p>

<i>Why does S. Paul say (1 Cor. xiii. 13), " The greatest of these is 
charity"?</i><p>

The theological virtues which consist in attaining the highest rule of 
action, which is God, because their object is God, are more excellent 
than the moral or intellectual virtues which consist in attaining to 
the rule of human reason. And among those theological virtues, that is 
chief which most attains to God. But faith and hope attain to God as 
from Him comes to us the knowledge of the true, or 
<!--
188 CHARITY. [Qu. xxiii. 7. 
--><A NAME="p188"></a>
 the acquiring of the good. But charity attains to God as He is in 
Himself, not as something comes to us from Him. Therefore it is more 
excellent than faith and hope, and consequently than any other virtue. <p>

(1) But is not intellect higher than will which it directs? And, if so, 
is not faith, the virtue of intelligence, more excellent than charity, 
the virtue of the will? But I answer that the intellectual operation 
finds its completion as the thought is in the thinker. And the nobility 
of intellectual action is measured by the degree of understanding. But 
the operation of will is perfected in the inclination of the soul to 
something as its terminus. Therefore the dignity of that inward action 
depends on the thing which is its object. But those things which are 
inferior to the human soul are in it in a nobler manner than they exist 
in themselves (a noteworthy proposition). But the things which are 
above the soul exist in a nobler way in themselves than they are in the 
soul. Therefore the knowledge of things below us is nobler than the 
love of them (Nic. Eth., vi. 7 and 12). But the love of things above 
us, and especially of God, is better than intellectual knowledge of 
them. Therefore charity is more excellent than faith. <p>

(2) The object of hope and of charity is, indeed, the same. But charity 
implies union with that good, while hope implies some distance from it. 
Charity does not regard that good as difficult, as hope does. Where 
union is already accomplished, the idea of difficulty is vanished. 
Therefore charity is more perfect than hope.  <p>

<i>Can any true virtue exist without charity?</i><p>

Virtue is directed to the good. But the good is principally the end, 
for the means are called good only with reference to the end. But there 
is an ultimate end and a proximate end; the one universal, the other 
particular. The ultimate and principal good of man is the fruition of 
God (Ps. lxxiii. 28) -- "it is good for me to draw near unto  
<!--
Qu. XXXIII 7.] CHARITY IN GENERAL VIEW. 189  
--><A NAME="p189"></a>
 God;" and man is directed to this by charity. But the secondary and 
particular good of man can be two-fold; one which is truly good, as 
ordainable for the chief good which is the ultimate end; but another is 
apparent, not true good, which draws one off from the final good. 
Speaking simply, then, true virtue is that which is ordained for the 
principal good of man; and so no true virtue can exist without charity. <p>

But if virtue be considered as directed to some particular end, some 
such virtue, ordained for some particular good, can exist without 
charity. But if that special good is not true, but only apparent, the 
virtue directed to that will not be true virtue at all, but only a 
false similitude of virtue. Thus the prudence of avaricious traders, 
devising various "speculations," is not true prudence; their justice, 
treating others fairly through fear of grave losses by unfair dealing, 
is not true justice; and their temperance, avoiding extravagant 
expense, is not true temperance, etc. <p>

But if the special good be truly good -- say, the preservation of the 
republic or anything of that kind -- there will be true virtue indeed, 
but imperfect if it is not referred to the final and perfect good. <p>

(1) But it is the property of virtue to produce a good act; and yet one 
who has not charity may found a hospital or an orphan asylum. I answer 
that the act of a man who has not this supernatural charity may belong 
to either one of two kinds. His act may be connected with his want of 
charity. Even if he found an orphan asylum, he may ordain it to the end 
of his infidelity (Girard Orphan Asylum, Philadelphia). Such act is 
always evil; the act of the unbeliever as such is always sin (S. Aug., 
Contra Julianum, iv. 3). <p>

But there can be an act of one who lacks charity, which does not spring 
from this want but from some other gift of God, as faith, or hope, or 
some natural good which is not 
<!--
190 CHARITY. [Qu. XXIV. 1, 2.]
--><A NAME="p190"></a>
 totally taken away by sin. In this way some act can be morally good in 
its kind without charity, which is not perfectly good, because it lacks 
due relation to the ultimate end. <p>

(2) It is objected again, that charity cannot exist without faith; but 
infidels may be faithful husbands, honest merchants, and so on. But I 
reply that in such case is not found simply perfect virtue in its kind, 
because the action is not ordained for its due end. (The man has a 
natural gift of chastity or justice, but he does not live as a child of 
God.) Charity ordains the acts of all the other virtues to their 
ultimate end. It gives their proper form to those acts.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 2. Charity in subjective view.</h4><p>

<i>Charity is not an emotion of the sensitive soul, but is a virtue of 
the will.</i><p>

The object of both is the good, but in different manner. For the object 
of sense-desire is the good apprehended by sense, but the object of 
spiritual desire is the good apprehended by the reason. Now the object 
of charity is Divine good, which is apprehended by reason only. 
Therefore the subject of charity is the human will. (Emotional love is 
not, as such, the love of charity.) <p>

The will is rational, indeed, but reason is not the rule of charity; it 
exceeds the rule of human reason.  <p>

<i>Charity is an infused virtue.</i><p>

Charity is a certain friendship between man and God, founded on the 
communication of eternal beatitude. But this communication is not due 
to natural gifts, but is a gift of grace. "The free gift of God is 
eternal life" (Rom. vi. 23). Hence, charity itself exceeds our natural 
powers, and can neither be in us by nature nor acquired by natural 
powers, because natural effects do not transcend their cause. Charity 
is in us, then, through an infusion from the Holy Ghost, who is the 
mutual love of the Father and the Son. "The love of Christ hath been 
shed abroad in our hearts 
<!--
Qu. xxiv; 8-7.] CHARITY IN SUBJECTIVE VIEW. 191
--><A NAME="p191"></a>
 through the Holy Ghost which was given unto us" (Rom. v. 5). <p>

(1) Divine good is naturally loved by all; but this love is founded on 
the communication of natural goods, while charity springs from a 
supernatural communication. <p>

(2) God is in Himself lovely in the highest degree, inasmuch as He is 
the object of beatitude. But it does not follow that He is so loved by 
us, because our affections are drawn to visible goods. <p>

(3) The preparation for charity on man's part is indicated by the 
apostle (1 Tim. i. 5), "Love out of a pure heart, and a good 
conscience, and faith unfeigned."  <p>

<i>Charity is not given according to each one's natural condition, or 
natural capacity,</i> <p>

but according to the good pleasure of the Holy Ghost distributing His 
gifts (1 Cor. xii. 4), for it exceeds human nature's proportions.  <p>

<i>Charity in this life, "charitas viae," can be increased.</i><p>

As we advance in the Christian life, we draw nearer to God through the 
affections of the soul. But charity, in uniting the soul to God, 
produces this nearness. If it could not be increased the progress of 
the Christian life would be stopped. Not that more things are loved, 
but in the intensity of its act God can be loved more. Thus it has 
greater efficacy. The subject of charity participates more in it. <p>

The act of charity may be a preparation for increase of charity, 
inasmuch as from one such act man is rendered more prompt to act again 
in the same way, and, ability increasing, he is more fervent in love, 
by which he seeks advancement in this supernatural gift.  <p>

Has </i>"charity of the way" any assignable limit?</i><p>

Limit may be found in the nature of the quality limited, 
<!--
192 CHARITY. [Qu. XXIV. 8. 
--><A NAME="p192"></a>
 or in the power of the agent which can produce no more, or in the 
capacity of the subject which is capable of no further perfection. But 
there is no limit to the increase of "charity of the way" in any such 
mode. For (1) it has no natural terminus, since it is a participation 
of infinite Love, which is the Holy Ghost; (2) the cause is of infinite 
influence, since it is God; and (3) on the part of the subject there is 
no limit, since the more charity increases, the ability for greater 
increase grows more and more.  <p>

<i>Can there be perfect charity in this life?</i><p>

Certainly God cannot be loved as much as He ought to be loved; for the 
measure of that is His goodness, which is infinite, and He therefore is 
infinitely lovely. But no creature can love Him infinitely, because 
created virtue is finite. In this way, no charity except God's can be 
perfect. But on the part of the one who loves, his charity is perfect 
when he loves to the uttermost of his power, and this may be true in 
either of three ways: <p>

(1) The whole heart of man maybe actually and continually directed to 
God. This is the perfect charity of the blessed saints, <i>"charitas 
patriae,"</i> which is not possible in this life. For here it is 
impossible, on account of the infirmity of human life, that we should 
be always thinking of God and be moved with love towards Him: <p>

(2) Man may direct all his desire and purpose to have leisure for God 
and heavenly things, setting aside all other pursuits except so far as 
present necessity requires, and that perfection of charity is possible 
in this life, although it is not found wherever charity exists: <p>

(3) One may habitually fix all his heart on God, so that he neither 
thinks nor wills anything which he knows to be contrary to the love of 
God; and this perfection is common in all who have charity. <p>

When the apostle said that he was not "already perfect" (Phil. iii. 
12), he was speaking of the "charitas  
<!--
Qu. XIV. 10.] CHARITY IN SUBJECTIVE VIEW. 193 
--><A NAME="p193"></a>
 patriae," but in the fifteenth verse of the same 
chapter he speaks of the perfect <i>"charitas viae."</i> <p>

S. John says, that "if we say that we have no sin, we deceive, 
ourselves" (1 Ep. i. 8), but venial sins are not contrary to the habit 
of charity, though they are so to its act. They are therefore repugnant 
to the <i>"charitas patriae,"</i> not to the <i>"charitas viae."</i>  <p>

<i>Can charity be directly diminished?</i><p>

In speaking of increase or diminution of charity, we must look, not at 
the object proper, but at the subject. Can it be diminished on this 
side? That must be either through some act or through mere cessation 
from action. In the latter way virtues which are acquired by acts are 
diminished or even sometimes destroyed. (See page 59.) For the 
preservation of each thing depends on its cause. But the cause of 
acquired virtue is human acts. Those acts ceasing, the acquired virtue 
is diminished, and at length totally corrupted. But this has no place 
in charity. And the act ceasing, it is not on that account diminished 
or destroyed, unless there be sin in that very cessation of action. <p>

Diminution of charity, then, can be caused only by God, or by some sin. 
But God causes no defect in us except by way of penalty, in withdrawing 
His grace as the penalty for sin. Hence He does not diminish charity 
unless it be as a penalty which is due to sin. The sole cause of 
diminution, therefore, is sin, either effectively or by way of desert.
But in neither way does mortal sin diminish charity; it totally 
destroys the love of God, both effectively, because every mortal sin is 
contrary to charity, and also by way of desert, since he who by mortal 
sin acts against charity deserves that God withdraw charity from his 
soul. <p>

Similarly, also, charity cannot be diminished by venial sin, either 
effectively or meritoriously. Not effectively, because that venial sin 
does not reach to charity which con<!--
194 CHARITY. [Qu. XXIV. 11. 
 --><A NAME="p194"></a>cerns the ultimate end, while venial sin is inordination respecting 
the means to that end. But love of the end is not diminished because 
one commits some inordination respecting the means, as it may happen 
that some infirm people much loving health may he guilty of some 
inordination respecting the rules of diet. Likewise, also, venial sin 
does not merit diminution of charity, for when one fails in the less, 
he does not deserve to suffer loss in the more important. For God does 
not more turn Himself from man, than man turns himself from Him. (Note 
that.) <p>

He, then, who is inordinately related towards the means to the end, 
does not merit to suffer loss in charity by which he is ordained for 
the ultimate end. <p>

Our conclusion is that charity can in no way be directly diminished. 
But, indirectly, a disposition for the loss of it may be called its 
diminution, and this preparation for its loss comes from venial sins, 
or even through ceasing from the exercise of works of charity.  <p>

<i>Can charity, once had, be lost again?</i><p>

By charity the Holy Ghost dwells in us. So we may consider it in three 
lights (1) On the side of the Holy Spirit moving the soul to the love 
of God. And from this point of view "charity never faileth," by virtue 
of the Holy Ghost, who infallibly works whatever He wills. And it is 
impossible that at once the Holy Ghost should will to move any one to 
the act of charity, and that he should lose charity by sinning. <p>

(2) But in another way charity may be considered as it is in itself, 
and so it can produce nothing which does not pertain to it. Hence 
charity cannot sin, any more than fire can generate cold. <p>

(3) It may be considered with reference to its subject, who is 
changeable according to the liberty of his choice. <i>"Charitas 
patriae,"</i> which fills up the whole capacity of the
<!--
Qu. xxiv. 12.] CHARITY IN SUBJECTIVE VIEW. 195 
--><A NAME="p195"></a>
 rational soul, cannot be lost. (Such a change of being in such a being 
is inconceivable.) But charity in this life, <i>"charitas viae,"</i> 
does not so fill up the measure of the rational soul that every actual 
motion of it is directly referred to God; and such charity can be lost 
indirectly, through something else occurring. The property of habit is 
that it inclines a power to its proper act, making that seem good 
which harmonizes with the habit, and that seem evil which is repugnant 
to it. For as the sense of taste judges of savours according to its 
condition, so the mind of man judges about the doing of anything 
according to its habitual disposition. In heaven, where God is seen as 
He is, charity cannot fail, because that which agrees with charity can 
never appear to be anything but good. But in this life it is not so. <p>

(1) "Whosoever is begotten of God cannot sin" (1 Ep. S. John iii. 9), 
so far as the power of the Holy Ghost who dwells in him is concerned. <p>

(2) The charity which can cease to love what once it l4ved is not true 
charity at all; but the mutability of the subject of charity is another 
matter. <p>

(3) It is true that charity excludes all motives for sin, as self-love, 
or cupidity, or any such thing. But sometimes it happens that 
<i>"charitas viae"</i> is not in actual operation given to it, charity 
is (though habitually present), and then may intervene some motive for 
sinning, and if consent is given to it, charity is lost.  <p>

<i>Charity is lost by any one act of mortal sin.</i><p>

One of two contraries vanishes if the other supervene. Now any act 
whatsoever of mortal sin is in its proper  nature contrary to charity, 
which consists in loving God above all things, and in man's being 
totally subject to Him, referring all things to Him. It is of the 
essence of charity that we so love God that we will in all things to be 
subject to Him, and in all things to follow the rule of His 
<!--
196 CHARITY. [Qu. xxiv. 12. 
--><A NAME="p196"></a>
 commandments. For whatever is contrary to them is manifestly contrary 
to charity, and of itself can exclude charity. <p>

If, indeed, charity were an acquired habit depending on the virtue of 
the subject of it, it would not follow that by one contrary act it 
should be destroyed. For act is directly contrary to act, not to habit. 
Continuance of the habit does not require continuance of the act. 
Hence, from a supervening contrary act an acquired habit is not 
immediately excluded. But charity, since it is an infused habit, 
depends on the action of God who infuses it. He is like the sun 
illuminating the world. And as the light would immediately cease to 
pass through air if some obstacle should intervene and shut off the 
sun, so also charity immediately ceases to be in the soul if any 
obstacle is put in the way of God's infusing it. But it is manifest 
that any mortal sin, being contrary to the Divine commandments, is such 
an obstacle, because man chooses to prefer his sin to the Divine 
friendship, which requires that we follow God's will and, consequently, 
by one act of mortal sin the habit of charity is lost. <p>

With this agrees the Word of God, for it says that by mortal sin man 
merits eternal death -- "The wages of sin is death" (Rom. vi. 23). But 
whosoever has charity merits eternal life. "He that loveth Me, shall be 
loved of My Father, and I will love him, and will manifest Myself unto 
him" (S. John xiv. 21). In this manifestation is eternal life. "This is 
life eternal, that they may know Thee, the only true God, and Him whom 
Thou didst send" (S. John xvii. 3). But no one can at once be worthy of 
eternal life and of eternal death. Therefore it is impossible that any 
one have charity with mortal sin.  <p>

(1) It may be said that S. Peter in denying Christ sinned mortally, and 
yet charity was not extinct in him, but only asleep. But I reply that 
charity is lost either directly
<!--
Qu. XXV. 1.] THE OBJECT OF CHARITY. 197
--><A NAME="p197"></a>
 through actual contempt, and in this way he did not lose it, or 
indirectly, when something contrary to charity is committed on account 
of some passion of concupiscence or fear; and, in this way, Peter, 
acting against charity, lost it, but quickly recovered it. <p>

(2) Inordinate affection for created good sometimes constitutes mortal 
sin -- <i>sc.</i>, when it is such as directly opposes the Divine will 
-- and this inordination is directly contrary to charity.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 3. The object of charity.</h4><p>

<i>Charity extends itself to love of our neighbour.</i><p>

"This commandment have we from God, that he who loves God, love his 
neighbour also" (1 Ep. S. John iv. 21). It is the same specific act by 
which God is loved and that by which our neighbotir is loved. For the 
reason of loving our neighbour is God, since what we ought to love in 
our neighbour is that he is in God.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

(1) There is a fear of man on account of what is his -- say, his 
cruelty; and there is another fear of man on account of what is of God 
in him -- say, his Divine office; and such fear of man, like the 
corresponding love, is not separable from the fear and love of God. <p>

(2) A different honour, indeed, is due to God from that which is due to 
our neighbour. But all love of charity is referred to the one common 
good; whereas we give diverse honours to different individuals 
according to their separate and diverse virtues. <p>

(3) Hope precedes charity, and yet hope directed to man is blamed if 
that man is regarded as the author of our salvation, but not if he is 
viewed as the minister of God in such relations.  
<!--
198 CHARITY. [Qu. xxv. 4, 5.  
--><A NAME="p198"></a>
 We cannot love the brutes with the love of charity, because there can 
be no proper union of life with them, much less the communion of 
eternal beatitude. <p>

But still they can be loved out of charity, as good things which we 
wish others to have; <i>sc.</i>, that they may be preserved for the 
honour of God, and the utility of men.  <p>

<i>Ought man to love himself out of charity?</i><p>

Of course we cannot properly speak of friendship with one's self, but 
the unity of self is the type of union with another; the love of self 
is the pattern and root of love of another. For we have friendship for 
others when they are a sort of second self. But we can speak of charity 
according to its proper idea, as principally the friendship of man with 
God, and, consequent on that, with what belongs to God. Among which 
things is also the man who has charity. And so among the things which 
he loves out of charity as pertaining to God, he may love himself with 
the love of charity. <p>

Evil men in the last days will be "lovers of themselves" (2 Tim. iii. 
1), but this self-love is according to our sensuous nature, which is 
not truly loving self according to our rational nature and wishing for 
self those good things which pertain to the perfection of reason, which 
love in the highest degree pertains to charity.  <p>

<i>Our bodily nature is from God, and shares in those works by which we 
may arrive at the perfect fruition of God.</i> <p>

Some beatitude reaches to the body; <i>sc.</i>, vigour of health and 
incorruption. Therefore, because the body is to be a participator in 
beatitude, it can be loved with the love of charity. <p>

When the apostle desired to be freed from "the body of this death" 
(Rom. vii. 24), and "to depart and he with Christ" (Phil. i. 23), he 
did not shrink from communion with his body as respects the bodily 
nature. He wished to  
<!--
Qu. xxv. 6.] THE OBJECT OT CHARITY. 199 
--><A NAME="p199"></a>
 be free from the infection of concupiscence, which remains in the 
body, and from its corruption, which loads down the soul from seeing 
God; and so he expressly called it "the body of this death."  <p>

<i>Are sinners to be loved out of charity?</i><p>

We may consider either their nature or their sin. According to the 
nature which they have from God they are capable of beatitude, on the 
communion in which charity is founded; and, therefore, according to 
their nature they are to be loved out of charity. But their fault is 
opposed to God, and is an impediment of beatitude. Hence, according to 
their sin, by which they are adversaries of God, all sinners, even 
father and mother and nearest relatives, are to be hated (S. Luke xiv. 
26). For sinners we ought to hate because they are sinners, and to love 
because they are men, capable of beatitude; and this is the true love 
of charity, for God's sake. <p>

(1) David said, out of charity, "I hate them that imagine evil things" 
(Ps. cxix. 113). But hating the evil of any one is all one with loving 
his good. <p>

(2) But sometimes just men do not exhibit to sinners the works of love; 
on the contrary, they seem to act out of hatred; as the Psalmist said 
(Ps. ci. 11), "I shall soon destroy all the ungodly that are in the 
land." But the kind deeds of friendship are not to be withheld from 
sinful neighbours as long as there is hope of their amendment, but aid 
for their recovery is to be afforded much more than for loss of money, 
since virtue has more to do with friendship than money has. But when 
they fall into the greatest malice, and become hopeless in their sin, 
then the familiarity of friendship is not to be exhibited to them. And 
so sinners of this kind, from whom injury to others is to be expected 
instead of their own amendment, are sometimes cut off by human and by 
Divine law. And yet this is done, not out of hatred for them (as human 
beings), but out of charity,
<!--
200 CHARITY. [Qu. xxv. 8. 
--><A NAME="p200"></a>
 because the public good is preferred to the life of an individual. And 
even death inflicted by just sentence may benefit the sinner, if he 
penitently expiate his fault; or, if he be not converted, at least his 
power of sinning further (in that way) is taken away. <p>

(3) What, then, shall we say of the imprecatory Psalms? (a) They are 
prophetic denunciations. (b) The desire of the speaker is not referred 
to the punishment of men as punishment, but to the justice of the One 
who inflicts the penalty. "The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth 
the vengeance;" he shall say, "Doubtless there is a God that judgeth 
the earth" (Ps. lviii. 9). For even God Himself delights not in the 
destruction of the wicked, but in His justice. (c) The desire is 
referred to the removal of the sin, not to the penalty of it in itself. <p>

(4) Charity will not make us will what sinners will, or rejoice in what 
they rejoice in; but its aim will be that they may will what better men 
will, and rejoice with them. <p>

(5) As respects association with sinners out of charity, the weak will 
avoid it out of fear of the danger of perversion; but where there is no 
such occasion for fear, it is laudable to associate with sinners for 
the sake of their conversion, as the Lord did. Association in the sin 
is another matter.  <p>

<i>Is it essential to charity that enemies be loved?</i><p>

The Lord commanded, "Love your enemies" (S. Matt. v. 44). Now, love of 
enemies may be considered in three ways (1) That they be loved as 
enemies; and this is perverted affection and repugnant to charity, 
because it is loving the evil which is in another. (2) Love of enemies 
may be referred to their nature, in a general way, and so it is an 
essential part of charity; <i>sc.</i>, that one who loves God and his 
neighbour may not exclude his enemies from that all-embracing love. (3) 
Love of enemies may be considered in its special application to 
particular enemies; <i>sc.</i>, that one be moved by a special impulse of 
love for his individual 
<!--
Qu. xxv. 9.1] THE OBJECT OF CHARITY. 201 
--><A NAME="p201"></a>
 enemy. And that is not absolutely essential to charity, since it would 
be practically impossible that there should he a special impulse of 
love towards every individual man, woman, and child. And yet, as a 
preparation of the soul, this is essential to charity, namely, that we 
be prepared to love our individual enemy, if need should arise. But 
that, apart from need, man should actually fulfil this and love his 
individual enemy for God's sake, pertains to the perfection of charity. 
For since out of charity our neighbour is loved for God's sake, the 
more we love God, the more we show love to our neighbour, no enmity 
impeding us from love; just as, if one should love any man, he would 
love his children, even though they were personal enemies. <p>

Charity, indeed, does not destroy nature, and each thing naturally 
hates what is contrary to itself, as contrary to it. But enemies as 
such are contrary to us, and this we ought to hate in them; it ought to 
displease us that they are enemies. But they are not opposed to us as 
men and capable of beatitude. In this regard we ought to love them.  <p>

<i>Is it necessary to salvation that one show signs and effects of love 
towards his enemy?</i><p>

The Lord said (S. Luke vi. 27), "Do good to them that hate you," which 
precept pertains to the perfection of charity ("Be ye therefore 
perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect"). But that which 
pertains to the perfection of charity is not a necessary part of it. 
Note, then, that the effects and signs of charity proceed from inward 
love and are proportioned to it. Inward love of our enemy in a general 
way is an absolutely necessary part of charity, but in special 
application, only according to the preparation of the soul; I mean, as 
above, that we must he ready to love our individual enemy as need may 
occur. The same thing is to be said of showing outwardly the effects 
and signs of love. There are certain signs or kind deeds of love which 
are 
<!--
202 CHARITY. [Qu. xxvi. 1, 2. 
--><A NAME="p202"></a>
 exhibited to every neighbour, as when one prays for all the faithful, 
or for all the people, or when one bestows some benefit on the whole 
community. Such benefits or signs of love must be exhibited to enemies. 
This is an obligation of charity. For if they were not so exhibited, 
there would be a revengeful spirit (mortal sin, and against charity). 
But there are certain benefits or signs of love which one gives to 
special friends. It is not essential to salvation that such be offered 
to enemies, except that we must be ready to do so in case of need. "If 
thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink" (Rom. xii. 
20). But that, apart from necessity, one exhibit benefits of this kind 
to his enemies, pertains to the perfection of charity by which one not 
only avoids being "overcome of evil," which is necessary, but also aims 
to overcome evil with good," which belongs to perfection. He not only 
avoids being drawn into hatred on account of the injury done to him, 
but also through benefits he aims to draw his enemy into loving him.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 4. The order of charity.</h4><p>

Charity tends towards God as the source of beatitude, and, therefore, 
there is an order in charity depending on the relation of other things 
to the first principle of this love, which is God.  <p>

<i>Is God to be loved more than our neighbour?</i><p>

(Note that this love is esteem, not necessarily intensity of love.) 
Every friendship chiefly regards that in which is chiefly found the 
good in whose communication the friendship is grounded. But the 
friendship of charity is grounded on the communication of beatitude 
which essentially is in God, from Him derived to all who are capable of 
it. God, therefore, is to be loved in the first place, as the cause of 
beatitude; but our neighbour, as participating along with us in that 
beatitude so derived. And the Lord said (S. Luke xiv. 26), "If any man 
come to Me, and hate not his 
<!--
Qu. xxvi. 3.] THE ORDER OF CHARITY. 203  
--><A NAME="p203"></a>
 father and mother -- he cannot be My disciple." Neighbours, then, are 
to be hated if they lead away from God -- <i>i.e.</i>, God out of 
charity is to be loved more than they. <p>

(1) But S. John says (1 Ep. iv. 20), "He that loveth not his brother 
whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?" Sight 
is the cause of love as a medium of acquiring it. Not that anything is 
lovely because it is visible, but because through vision we are led to 
love. Not that that which is more visible is to be more loved, but it 
is the first to meet our love. So argues the apostle. For our neighbour 
is the first object which meets our love, and if any one love not him, 
it may be argued that he does not love God, not because his neighbour 
is more worthy of love, but because he is its first object. <p>

(2) Likeness is cause of love, and there is greater similitude between 
man and man than between man and God. But the latter is prior, and the 
cause of the former. Participating from God in that which our neighbour 
also has from Him, we are made like our neighbour. This, therefore, is 
an argument for loving God the most. <p>

(3) But is not God loved in our neighbour? Yes; but our neighbour has 
not that goodness which is the ground of love essentially, but only by 
participation. (Inferior goodness is the reason for inferior love.)  <p>

<i>Should man out of charity love God more than he loves himself?</i><p>

We can receive two goods from God -- the good of nature, and the good 
of grace. On the communication of the first is founded natural love, by 
which not only man in his sound, natural condition loves God above all 
things, but so does also every creature after its manner, tending to 
the common good of the whole, rather than to its own individual good. <p>

Much more is this true in the love of charity, which is founded on the 
communication of the gifts of grace. 
<!--
204 CHARITY. [Qu. xxvi. 4. 
--><A NAME="p204"></a>
 Therefore, man ought to love God, who is the common good of all, above 
himself, because beatitude is in God, as in the common fount, for all 
who can participate in it. <p>

(1) It may be asserted that anything is loved as being one's own good, 
and therefore self, which is the cause of the loving, is more loved. 
And it is true that the part loves the good of the whole, according as 
that good is convenient for itself; but yet it does not refer that good 
of the whole to itself (selfishly), but it refers itself to the good of 
the whole. <p>

(2) Again, it may be said that in loving the fruition of God one loves 
himself, since this is the highest good which one can wish for himself. 
But love of desire is not love of friendship, and towards God the 
latter is greater than the former, because greater is the good which He 
is, than the good in which we can participate through eternal joys.  <p>

<i>Should man out of charity love himself more than he loves his 
neighbour?</i><p>

The Lord said (S. Matt. xxii. 39), "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as 
thyself." Love of self, then, is the exemplar, the pattern, of love for 
our neighbour. But the pattern is more than that which is patterned 
after it. Therefore, man should love himself more than he loves his 
neighbour. Man is said to love himself, because his spiritual nature is 
the object of his love (see page 48). And after this manner man ought 
to love himself the most after God. Consider the very idea of this 
love. God is loved as the source of good on which is founded the love 
of charity. But man loves himself out of charity, as he is a 
participator of that good, but his neighbour is loved as an associate 
in that good. Bat such association is the reason of love according to a 
certain union in relation to God. But unity is more powerful than union, 
and that man himself participates in Divine good is a more potent 
reason for loving than that another is associated with him in that 
participation. And a further  
<!--
Qu. XXVI. 5.] 205 THE ORDER OF CHARITY. 
--><A NAME="p205"></a>
 proof that man ought to love himself more than his neighhour is that 
man ought not to incur any sin (even the slightest venial sin) which is 
a hindrance to the participation of beatitude, in order to deliver his 
neighbour (or any number of neighbours) from sin. <p>

(1) A man ought to bear corporeal losses for his neighbour, but in this 
very thing he spiritually loves himself more, because this pertains to 
the perfection of virtue, which is a spiritual good. <p>

(2) Why, then, is it said that "Charity seeketh not her own"? (1 Cor. 
xiii. 5). Because, I answer, she seeks the common good, preferring that 
to her own proper good.  <p>

<i>Ought man to love his neighbour more than his own body?</i><p>

That is to be more loved out of charity which has more fully the idea 
of a "lovable object." But association in beatitude, which is the 
reason for loving our neighbour, is a greater reason for loving than 
such share of beatitude as indirectly belongs to the body, which is the 
reason for extending the love of charity to our own body. Therefore, 
the salvation of our neighbour's soul is more to be loved than our own 
body. <p>

(1) Our body, indeed, is nearer to our soul than our neighbour is; but 
as regards the participation of beatitude, his soul is nearer ours than 
our own body is. <p>

(2) But, it is said, each one exposes that which he loves less, for 
that which he loves more, and every man is not bound to expose his own 
body for the safety of his neighbour, for this belongs to the perfect 
in charity, as the Lord said (S. John xv. 13) "Greater love hath no 
man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." But I 
answer that every one has the care of his own body, and every one has 
not the care of his neighbour's salvation, except in case of necessity. 
Therefore, it is not essential to charity that one offer his body for 
the salvation of his neigh 
<!--
200 CHARITY. [Qu. xxvi. 6. 
--><A NAME="p200"></a>
 hour except where he is bound to provide for it. That he should freely 
offer himself pertains to the perfection of charity. (Every one is 
bound by charity to succour his neighbour in extreme spiritual 
necessity, even with certain peril of death, if there be hope of 
benefit thereby.) <p>

It is plain from this that those who have the cure of souls are bound 
to run any risk of pestilence, etc., for the grave spiritual necessity 
of those under their charge. But where there is no official duty, 
charity may gain for one a double reward.  <p>

<i>Are all neighbours to be loved equally?</i><p>

Some have said that all are to be equally loved inwardly out of charity 
according to the affection of the heart, but not as regards outward 
effects of it; that greater benefits are due to those who are nearer. 
But this is a mistake. For the inclination, whether of nature or of 
grace, is proportioned to the things which are to be done through it. 
We must have intenser affection of charity to those whom we ought to 
benefit the more. According to the affection of the soul one neighbour 
is to be loved more than another. And the reason is that since there 
are two principles of love -- viz., God, and the one who loves -- love 
necessarily varies according to the propinquity of the one who is loved 
to one or other of these two principles. <p>

Again, the degree of love is to be measured by the gravity of sins 
against love. But he sins more grievously who acts against the love of 
some neighbours than he who offends against others. And the Old Law 
says (Lev. xx. 9), "He that curseth father or mother shall be put to 
death." This is not commanded against all who curse others. Therefore 
we ought to love some neighbours more than others. <p>

(1) In one way all are to be loved equally, viz., that we desire 
eternal beatitude for all; but equal intensity of love is not due to 
all alike. Inequality in beneficence, also, must be observed, because we 
cannot do good to all. But 
<!--
Qu. XXVI. 8.] THE ORDER OF CHARITY. 207 
--><A NAME="p207"></a>
 good-will such inequality has no place. We can wish in equal beatitude 
for all, though not with equal intensity of Love. <p>

(2) Some also are nearer to God through greater goodness, and such are 
to be more loved for that reason.  <p>

<i>Ought we to love our relatives more than better men?</i><p>

S. Paul seems to say so, when he says (1 Tim. v. 8), "If any provideth 
not for his own, and specially his own household, he hath denied the 
faith and is worse than an infidel." Love, like every activity, takes 
its specific character from its object, but its intensity from the one 
who loves. But the object of the love of charity is God; the one who 
loves is man. Therefore the specific diversity of love of charity which 
distinguishes it from natural emotion depends on the loving our 
neighbors in relation to God; <i>sc.</i>, that out of charity we will 
greater good for him who is nearer God. For although that good is one 
in itself, viz., eternal beatitude, still it has different grades in 
the diverse participation of it. And it pertains to charity to desire 
that the justice of God bear rule, and that the better participate more 
perfectly in beatitude <p>

But the intensity of the love depends on the one who loves, and charity 
more intensely desires good for those who are nearest than it desires 
greater good for better men. <p>

Again, out of charity I can wish that he who is conjoined to me by 
earthly bonds be better than another, and so attain to higher 
beatitude. Again, out of charity we may love in various ways those 
united to us by earthly bonds. For with those not so conjoined we have 
only the friendship of charity; but with relatives, we have other 
kinds of friendship. But when the good on which that other friendship 
is founded is ordained to the end of charity, charity itself may 
command the act of that other friendship (<i>e.g.</i>, love of man and 
wife). Thus the loving another because he is a blood-relation or united 
otherwise, or because 
<!--
208 CHARITY. [Qu. XXVI. 8. 
--><A NAME="p208"></a>
 he is a fellow-citizen, may be commanded by charity; and so from 
charity both eliciting and commanding in various ways, we love those 
united to us more than better men. <p>

(1) But there may be grounds of hating in some manner those connected 
with us (S. Luke xiv. 26), whereas the good can in no way be hated. I 
reply that we are not bidden to hate those nearest to us because of 
their connection, but as they keep us away from God; so far they are 
enemies, not relatives (Mic. vii. 6). <p>

(2) But God loves more those who are better, and charity makes us most 
like to God. I answer, yes; in due proportion -- viz., that man shall be 
so related to what is his, as God is related to what is His. And some 
things charity may lead us to will, as suitable for us, which God does 
not will, because it is not holy and righteous that He should will 
them. <p>

(3) But by natural affection we love more those who are more closely 
united to us, as parents and children; whereas charity is founded on 
the communion of beatitude, in which better men have the larger share. 
Yes; but charity not only elicits the act of love according to the 
character of its object, but also according to the state of the one who 
loves.  <p>

<i>Should kindred be loved the most?</i><p>

It has been shown that out of charity those who are more united to us 
are to be loved more, both because they are loved more intensely, and 
because they are loved for more reasons. The intensity depends upon the 
union. And therefore the love of diverse persons is to be measured 
according to the diverse nature of the union; each one is to be loved 
more in that which pertains to the fellowship according to which he is 
loved. And love is to be compared with love, as fellowship is compared 
with fellowship. Thus, then, the friendship of kindred is founded on 
common origin, but that of fellow-citizens on civil communion, etc. And 
therefore in those things which pertain to nature, we 
<!--
Qu. XXVI. 11.] THE ORDER OF CHARITY. 209 
--><A NAME="p209"></a>
 ought more to love our kindred; but in those things which pertain to 
civil life, our fellow-citizens, etc. But if we compare one fellowship 
with another, it is evident that natural kinship is prior and more 
permanent; but other unions supervene on that and can be removed. And 
therefore love of kindred is the more lasting; but other friendships 
can be more potent in that which is proper to each of them. <p>

(1) But friends are made by free choice and judgment. Yes; and 
therefore such friendship preponderates where we have our choice in 
what we are to do along with them. But kinship is more stable, since it 
exists by nature and prevails in that which belongs to nature. We are 
more bound to assist kindred in need than we are to aid near friends. <p>

(2) If spiritual children have higher claims as regards the 
communication of grace, children by nature have higher claims for 
bodily assistance. <p>

And note that in the Decalogue parents are named as the nearest by 
blood, and therefore the nearest in affection.<p>

(Looking at love objectively, S. Thomas finds ground for loving a 
father above a child; but subjectively -- <i>i.e.</i>, on the side of 
the one who loves -- he reverses this view. Also he places father above 
mother in the order of filial love.)  <p>

<i>Should a man love his wife more than father or mother?</i><p>

S. Paul (Eph. v. 28) says that husbands ought "to love their wives as 
their own bodies." But a man ought to love his neighbour more than his 
own body, and parents are nearest neighbours. So it might he argued 
that parents are to be loved more than wife. This needs examination. 
The degree of love depends, on the one hand, on the idea of the good; 
on the other, on the degree of union with the one who loves. According 
to the first, parents are to be more loved, because the good in the 
parental relation is preeminent. But according to the second, the wife 
has the prefer<!--
210 CHARITY. [Qu. xxvi. 11. 
 --><A NAME="p210"></a>ence, for husband and wife are "one flesh" (S. Matt. xix. 6). We 
conclude that the wife is to be loved more intensely, but greater 
reverential love is due to parents. <p>

But why do the Scriptures say that a man "shall leave father and 
mother" for his wife? (Gen. ii. 24.) This is said of cohabitation, not 
of abandonment in all respects, for in certain respects a man's first 
duty is still to his parents. <p>

The word "as" in Eph. v. 28 is not an adverb of equality, but it gives 
the reason for the love of her who is most closely conjoined to one's 
self. <p>

(A similar view is adopted with respect to benefactors and those who 
receive benefits; the latter have before them the good as the object of 
love; the former are more closely united to the object of benefaction.) <p>

In the Christian's fatherland God will be first in love, by 
uninterrupted action. And in that perfect conformity of the human will 
to the Divine, as regards the good which each wishes for each, the 
best will be best loved, in the wish that they may most perfectly enjoy 
the common beatitude. He will be regarded as nearest neighbour who is 
nearest to God. But self will be most intensely loved, since each one 
will, first of all, direct all his powers towards God. And this 
pertains to self-love. (I do not find this clear and satisfactory. -- 
J. J. E.) That provision of love by which each one is bound to succour 
kindred in their need will cease, and so far the inclination of charity 
towards them. But still, in the fatherland, one may love his kindred in 
various ways, for the causes of honourable love will not come to an 
end. But incomparably above all these reasons for love will be the 
nearness to God. Nature is not taken away by glory, but perfected. <p>

(Seven acts or effects of charity may he distinguished first and chief, 
love; then three internal acts, joy, peace, and mercy; then three 
outward acts or kind deeds in general; <i>sc.</i>, "beneficence," 
alms-giving, and brotherly correction. 
<!--
Qu. xxvii. 2, 3, 5.] LOVE. 211 
--><A NAME="p211"></a>
 The first four will be abridged from the author's fuller statements.)  <p>

<h4>&sect; 5. Love.</h4><p>

<i>Is love (<i>dilectio</i>), as the act or effect of charity, the same 
as benevolence?</i> <p>

Benevolence, as the word intimates, is the act of the will by which we 
will another's good. But this, even when founded in judgment, may exist 
without true love. Spiritual love, as distinguished from the passion in 
the sense-appetite, implies a union of affections, so that the one who 
loves regards the one who is loved as in a certain way one with himself 
or as belonging to himself, which is not implied in benevolence. Love, 
then, includes the other, but adds to it.  God is to be loved out of 
charity for Himself alone. <p>

That is, He is the ultimate final cause of all, and there is nothing 
beyond Him on account of which we may love Him. Again, His goodness is 
Himself, underived, and the exemplar and source of all goodness in 
other beings. He cannot, properly speaking, be loved on account of His 
goodness, because He is goodness. But, again, from other sources the 
love of God for Himself alone may spring up in the heart; thus He may 
be loved because of benefits received or rewards promised (1 5. John 
iv. 19).  <p>

<i>How can we "love God with all our heart"? (Deut. in. 5.)</i><p>

If we speak of loving God wholly, we may have one of three different 
things in mind: (1) We may mean that everything which pertains to God 
is loved; (2) we may mean what is commanded above, that we love God 
with all our power of love, and ordain all things which fall under our 
power with reference to that love, both of which we can and ought to 
do; or (3) we may refer to the object 
<!--
212 CHARITY. [Qu. xxvii. 7. 
--><A NAME="p212"></a>
 of love, and speak of loving in a manner adequate to the object of 
love. This, of course, in this case is impossible. For God's goodness 
is infinite and infinitely lovely. There is no limit to that love. The 
more God is loved, the better is that love. There can be no excess in 
it.  <p>

<i>Is it more meritorious to love an enemy than to love a friend?</i><p>

Remember that God is the ground of our loving our neighbour out of 
charity. Loving an enemy, then, and loving a friend, may be compared in 
two ways, either on the side of the neighbour who is loved, or on the 
side of the reason for loving him. In the first way, the love of a 
friend is superior because a friend is better and more united with us. 
Here is a more suitable object for love, and the love is therefore 
better, as, also, its opposite is worse. For it is worse to hate a 
friend than to hate an enemy. And since it is better to love the 
better, and a friend is better than an enemy, so far it is more 
meritorious to love a friend. <p>

But now, on the other hand, let us consider the reason for loving. 
First, we see that some other reason than God may produce the love of a 
friend; but the love of an enemy is due to God only as the reason for 
it. And, in the next place, even if we suppose that both are loved for 
God's sake, the love of God is stronger when it extends more widely, 
even to the loving of our enemies. So that is the hottest fire whose 
influence is felt the most widely. The stronger love fulfils the more 
difficult things. But as the fire acts more powerfully on the nearer 
objects, so charity more fervently loves those who are joined in bonds 
of love. In this respect the love of friends, considered in itself, is 
more fervent, and is better than the love of enemies. <p>

Why, then, did the Lord say (S. Matt. v. 46), "If ye love them that 
love you, what reward have ye?" I answer that the love of friends is 
there regarded in itself -- <i>i.e.</i>, their being loved because they 
are friends, which has  
<!--
Qu. XXVIII.] Joy. 213 
--><A NAME="p213"></a>
 no reward with God. And this seems to be the case whenever friends are 
so loved that enemies are not loved.  <p>

<i>Is it more meritorious to love our neighbour than to love God?</i><p>

In such a comparison as that, we may consider each love in itself, and 
so viewed, there is no doubt that the love of God is more meritorious. 
For the reward is promised to that on its own account. The ultimate 
reward is the fruition of God, and the Lord said (S. John xiv. 21), "He 
that loveth Me, shall be loved of My Father, . . . and I will manifest 
Myself unto him." <p>

But again, in this comparison, we may, on the one hand, consider God as 
being the only object of love, and compare that with the love of our 
neighbour, which is for God's sake. Such love includes the love of God, 
while the love of God did not include the love of our neighbour. That 
is, perfect love of God, which extends itself to our neighbour, is 
compared with insufficient and imperfect love. In this sense, the love 
of our neighbour is superior. For "this commandment have we from God, 
that he who loveth God, love his brother also" (1 Ep. S. John iv. 21). <p>

But is it not easier, more natural, to love God? And is not the more 
difficult task of loving one's neighbour therefore meritorious? I reply 
that the good has more to do with virtue and merit than difficulty has. 
Not every more difficult task is more meritorious, but only when it is 
more difficult because it is better.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 6. Joy.</h4><p>

Spiritual joy is caused, in the first place, by the Divine good 
considered in itself; for what we love, we rejoice in seeing to 
possess its proper good. Or, again, the joy is caused by the 
participation of that Divine good, the presence of that which is loved 
in the soul. The first is better, and the special effect of charity. If 
what is loved were 
<!--
214 CHARITY. [Qu. XXIX. 
--><A NAME="p214"></a>
 altogether absent, sorrow would be the effect of charity; but there is 
a presence through grace, which is the cause of joy. The Lord said, 
indeed, "blessed are they that mourn," etc. But this mourning for what 
is opposed to the loved good has the same ground with the joy in that 
good itself. <p>

The Divine good considered in itself is the cause of the unmingled 
spiritual joy of charity (Phil. iv. 4); but that joy which results from 
participation in that infinite good can be mingled with sorrow, because 
that Participation can be impeded either in ourselves or in our 
neighbour, whom we love as ourself. <p>

The plenitude of joy cannot be looked for in this life, for desire 
always continues, seeking to draw nearer to God through grace. And so 
long as desire is not fully satisfied, the rest of spiritual joy in all 
its perfection is not attained. <p>

We must not regard joy as a separate virtue, but as an act, an effect, 
or a fruit of charity. And it is the subject of Divine precept because 
it is an act of charity.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 7. Peace.</h4><p>

Peace is more than concord. It embraces that and more besides. Wherever 
peace is found, there is concord; but concord may be found where peace 
does not exist. For concord is relative to others; it means the harmony 
of diverse wills agreeing with one consent. But the heart of one man 
also is (listracted, both by the conflict of diverse desires (Gal. v. 
17, " The flesh lusteth against the spirit "), and by the same desire 
seeking for diverse objects which cannot be at once possessed. But 
there must be inward as well as outward harmony to constitute that 
peace of which we now are speaking. <p>

Wars and dissensions are not sought for as an ultimate end, but as 
means for a more perfect peace. <p>

This inward and outward peace is the effect of charity for when God is 
loved with the whole heart, and all things 
<!--
Qu. xxx. 2.] MERCY AND PITY. 215 
--><A NAME="p215"></a>
 are referred to Him, there is inward harmony of all desires. And when 
our neighbour is loved as ourself, his will is sought for as our own. 
Friends will the same things. <p>

This outward peace does not, in this life, where there is imperfect 
knowledge of the truth, imply perfect concord of opinions, but only 
concord in the chief goods of our spiritual life. Dissension, then, in 
little things and in opinions, like that of SS. Paul and Barnabas (Acts 
xv.), is not repugnant to the peace of charity. For opinions pertain to 
judgment, which precedes desire. It is the latter where the concord is 
to be sought for. Again, where there is concord in the chief goods, 
dissension respecting trifles is not contrary to charity, for that 
dissension comes from diversity of opinions, where one judges the 
matter of dissension to pertain to the good in which all agree, while 
the judgment of the other holds the contrary opinion. Such dissension 
is opposed to the perfect peace of fatherland, not to the imperfect 
peace of the pilgrims thither (<i>in via</i>). <p>

We must not regard peace as a separate virtue, but as the act, effect, 
or fruit of charity. And as such act it is commanded by the Lord (S. 
Mark ix. 50).  <p>

<h4>&sect; 8. Mercy and pity (misericordia).</h4><p>

These are compassion for the evil which another is suffering, 
especially when he suffers without his own fault. But compassion may 
embrace even sinners, not as regards the voluntary sin, for pity 
concerns the involuntary evil, but as fault has attached to it that 
which is involuntary. So the Lord had compassion for the multitude (S. 
Matt. ix. 36).  <p>

He that loves, regards his friend as a part of himself, and his 
friend's evil as if it were his own. <p>

He "rejoices with them that rejoice;" and he "weeps with them that 
weep" (Rom. xii. 15). Anger and pride 
<!--
216 CHARITY. [Qu. XXX. 3, 4. 
--><A NAME="p216"></a>
 oppose this virtue, because the first lifts above the apprehension of 
evil; the other, because it leads to contempt of others, and to the 
notion that they suffer worthily.  <p>

<i>Is mercy a special virtue?</i><p>

Pain at another's trouble may be a passion of the sensitive nature. 
But, again, it may be an emotion of the higher intellectual soul, as 
the evil of another is displeasing to us. And this motion of the soul 
can be regulated by reason, and so can govern the brute passion of 
pity. Hence, S. Augustine says (Civ. Dei, ix. 5) "that emotion of the 
soul is obedient to reason when mercy is shown in such a way that 
justice is preserved, whether help is given to the needy, or pardon to 
the penitent." And since virtue consists in governing the motions of 
the soul by reason, such mercy is consequently a virtue. <p>

(1) It is the sentiment of compassion in the emotional soul which may 
impede justice. <p>

(2) The sentiment of vengeance and compassion are two contrary 
passions, each of them laudable in its place, the one pained at 
unworthy suffering in another, the other pleased at suffering which is 
due, and pained at the prosperity of the unworthy. <p>

(3) Mercy is a special virtue, because it adds a new idea <i>sc.</i>, 
the sorrow which is compassionated.  <p>

<i>Is mercy the highest of virtues?</i><p>

In itself it is so, because it spreads abroad to others, and, still 
more, it supplies the defects of others. Hence it is the peculiar 
property of God, and in it His omnipotence is specially manifested. But 
if we look, not at the thing in itself, but at him who has it, mercy is 
not the highest virtue unless he who has it is highest, having none 
above him. For if one has a superior, it is greater and better to be 
united to that superior than to supply the defects of an inferior. 
Charity, therefore, by which man is joined to God is more 
<!--
Qu. XXXI. 1.] BENEFICENCE. 2l7. 
--><A NAME="p2"></a>
 than mercy. But mercy is chief among the virtues which regard our 
neighbour. <p>

(1) God "desires mercy and not sacrifice" (Hos. vi. 6), because 
outward gifts and sacrifices are ordained not on His account, but ours 
and our neighbour's. For He does not need our sacrifices, but He wills 
that they be offered to Him for the sake of our own devotion and for 
the benefit of our neighbour. Therefore mercy, which supplies the needs 
of others, is the most acceptable sacrifice, since it comes nearer to 
the benefit of our neighbour. "To do good and to communicate, forget 
not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased" (Heb. xiii. 16). 
"But above all these things, put on charity, which is the bond of 
perfectness" (Col. iii. 14). <p>

(2) Mercy is the sum of the Christian religion as respects its outward 
manifestation; by it we are assimilated to God in His operations, for 
"His mercy is over all His works," and the Lord says: "Be ye therefore 
merciful, as your Father is merciful" (S. Luke vi. 36); but higher is 
the inward affection of charity by which we are united to God and 
assimilated to Him.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 9. Beneficence.</h4><p>

<i>How is beneficence the outward act of charity?</i><p>

Doing good to another may come under the idea of paying him his due; it 
is then an act of justice. It may come under the idea of relieving 
misery or defect; it is then an act of mercy. But it may also come 
under the general idea of the good, and so it is an act of friendship, 
of charity. For in the act of love is included benevolence, by which we 
will good to our friend. But will accomplishes its purpose if it have 
the power to do so. Therefore, beneficence follows from the act of 
love. <p>

But it is the act of charity from him who is in some way superior. 
Therefore, it is God's act of love towards us, not ours towards Him 
(but ours towards our brethren). 
<!--
218 CHARITY. [Qu. XXXI. 2, 8.  
--><A NAME="p218"></a>
 "As we have opportunity, we must do good to all men" (Gal. vi. 10). <p>

Beneficence proceeds from the superior to the inferior; but the grades 
among us are not immutable, for men can suffer manifold defects, and he 
who is superior in one respect may be inferior in another. And, 
therefore, since the love of charity extends to all, beneficence must 
be prepared to extend to all according to place and season. For all 
acts of the virtues are limited by their due circumstances. <p>

(1) In practice, it is not possible to do good to all; and virtue does 
not demand the impossible. But still there is no one who may not at 
some time, or place, or in some way, have a special claim on 
beneficence, and charity requires at least the preparation of soul to 
do good when opportunity presents itself, and the prayer of charity 
embraces all. <p>

(2) Sinners are not excluded, for they have their claim as men, which 
is to be met, without cooperating in their sin. <p>

(3) The same remark applies to enemies of the church or the state. 
Benefits are withdrawn in order that, if possible, they may be 
restrained from their fault. But in case of grave necessity, help is to 
be given under due restrictions, unless, in the latter case, they are 
suffering the penalties of just law.  Do we owe most beneficence to our 
nearest neighbours? <p>

Grace and virtue imitate the order of nature, which is instituted by 
Divine wisdom. But in that order of nature every natural agent diffuses 
its action first and most energetically to those things which are 
nearest to it, as the fire warms most what is closest to it. But the 
bestowing of benefits is an action of charity towards others, and, 
therefore, it must be most shown to those who are most near. But the 
nearness of one man to another depends on the various things in which 
men communicate with one another  
<!--
Qu. XXXI. 8.] BENEFICENCE. 219 
--><A NAME="p219"></a>
 -- kinship, citizenship, fellowship in spiritual things, etc. And 
according to these diverse fellowships diverse benefits are to be 
dispensed, to each one that benefit which pertains to his relationship 
to us. Yet this will be varied according to the diversity of places, 
times, and other circumstances. For in some cases the stranger in 
extreme necessity has higher claim than even a parent who has no such 
need. <p>

(1) But the Lord said (S. Luke xiv. 12), "When thou makest a dinner or 
a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, nor thy kinsmen, but 
bid the poor," etc. Yes; but the Lord did not simply prohibit the 
inviting of friends or kinsmen, but the doing it for the sake of a 
return in kind, which is not charity but cupidity. Still it can happen 
that strangers have the first claim on account of greater need. 
<i>Caeteris paribus</i>, the nearer are to be benefited first. But if, 
in the case of two persons, one is nearer and the other more needy, no 
universal rule can determine who is first to be aided, because there 
are various degrees of propinquity and of need. This requires prudent 
judgment. <p>

(2) But debts are to be paid before gratuitous benefits are conferred; 
therefore benefactors have the preference over neighbours (by kinship, 
etc.). I answer that there are two kinds of debt; one, which is not to 
be counted among the goods of him who owes, but rather among the 
creditor's goods, say, if one has another's property which has been 
stolen from him, or which is a loan, or a deposit, or anything of that 
nature. A man has first to restore this debt, rather than to do good 
out of it to those who are connected with him, unless perhaps there 
should be grave necessity, in which case it would even be lawful to 
take another's property in order to relieve the immediate want. But 
even in this case the condition of each in other respects would have to 
be prudently considered, and no universal rule can be laid down for the 
infinite variety of cases. <p>

But there is another debt which is reckoned among the goods of him who 
owes it, due not from necessity of justice, 
<!--
220 CHARITY. [Qu. xxxii. 1. 
--><A NAME="p220"></a>
 but from a kind of moral equity, as in the case of benefits freely 
received. But no benefactor as such is equal to parents. Therefore 
parents, in the recompensing of benefits, are to he preferred to all 
others, unless grave necessity should give the preponderance to the 
other side, or some other condition should do so, say, the common 
utility of the Church or the republic. But in other cases estimation is 
to be made of the benefaction and of the propinquity, and no general 
rule can be laid down which will determine each particular case. <p>

Note that beneficence is not a virtue distinct from charity, but is one 
of those outward acts of charity which are commanded (S. Matt. v. 44). <p>

<h4>&sect; 10. Alms-giving.</h4><p>

<i>Is alms-giving an act of charity?</i><p>

Outward acts are referred to that virtue to which pertains the motive 
for those acts. But the motive for alms-giving is the relief of 
suffering and need. Hence it may be defined as the giving to the needy, 
for God's sake, out of compassion. Now this motive pertains to mercy, 
which is the effect of charity. Consequently, alms-giving is an act of 
charity, through mercy. <p>

(1) But S. Paul said (1 Cor. xiii. 3), "Though I bestow all my goods to 
feed the poor, and have not charity, I am nothing," which implies that 
alms-giving is not the work of charity. But I reply that a thing done 
may be outwardly a virtuous act, when the virtue itself does not exist 
as doing just things is an act of justice, which may be done out of 
natural temperament, or fear of consequences, or hope of getting some 
advantage (acts "materially" just). <p>

But in another way acts are inwardly virtuous (<i>"formaliter"</i>), as 
it is the act of justice to do just things in the manner in which the 
just man does them -- <i>sc.</i>, promptly and with pleasure; and in 
this way the virtuous act cannot exist without the virtue. To give 
alms, then, as an outward act, simply, can be without charity; but 
true alms-giving 
<!--
Qu. XXXII. 2, 3.] ALMS-GIVING. 221 
--><A NAME="p221"></a>
 -- that is, for God's sake, pleasurably, and promptly, and in all 
other respects as one ought to do -- cannot be without charity. <p>

(2) The proper act elicited by one virtue may be attributed to another 
which commands it, and ordains it to its own end. So the prophet Daniel 
presented alms-giving as a work of satisfaction in the penitent, saying 
(Dan. iv. 27), "Redeem thine iniquities by showing mercy to the poor." 
And the Epistle to the Hebrews (Heb. xiii. 16) speaks of alms-giving as 
an act of worship towards God " With such sacrifices God is well 
pleased." <p>

S. John is conclusive (1 Ep. iii. II), "Whoso hath this world's goods 
and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his compassion from 
him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?"  <p>

The corporal works of mercy are well distinguished as seven in number: 
to feed the hungry, to give drink to the thirsty, to clothe the naked, 
to entertain the stranger, to relieve the prisoner, to visit the sick, 
and to bury the dead. Seven, likewise, are the spiritual works of 
mercy; viz., to teach the ignorant, to counsel the doubting, to console 
the sorrowful, to correct the erring, to forgive the offender, to bear 
the infirmities of the weak, and to pray for all.  <p>

<i>Compare the corporal and spiritual works of mercy.</i><p>

In themselves the spiritual have the preeminence, for three reasons: 
(1) That which is given is a nobler gift, because it is spiritual; (2) 
it is a nobler thing to benefit the soul, the higher part of man; for 
as a man ought first to provide for his own soul, so in the case of his 
neighbour whom he loves as himself; (3) the acts themselves are nobler 
acts. But, on the other hand, there may be some particular case in 
which some corporal work of mercy is preferable to some spiritual act, 
as feeding a man who is 
<!--
222 CHARITY. [Qu. XXXII. 4, 5. 
--><A NAME="p222"></a>
 dying of famine is better than teaching him (preaching to him). So it 
may be with some other very needy man. <p>

(1) It may be true, in some cases, that there is more recompense for 
spiritual works of mercy, but this does not detract from their praise 
and merit, if it be not the aim. So human glory is no detraction from 
the merit of virtue, if it was not the motive for action. <p>

(2) It is true, also, that the needy is likely to be more grateful for 
corporal mercy, and so there is more consolation for him in such acts. 
But merit does not depend on that in which the will of him who receives 
help actually rests, but rather on that in which he ought rationally to 
rest.  <p>

<i>Have the corporal works of mercy a spiritual effect?</i><p>

We may consider them in three ways: (1) In their substance; and so, of 
course, they have only material effect, in supplying the corporal needs 
of our neighbour. (2) But we may consider also their cause, the love of 
God and our neighbour. So viewed, they have spiritual fruit. "Give alms 
of thy goods, and never turn thy face from any poor man, and then the 
face of the Lord shall not be turned away from thee" (Tob. iv. 7). (3) 
We may consider their effect; and so they have spiritual fruit if the 
one who is succoured prays for his benefactor. <p>

(1) But it is the sin of simony to try to purchase spiritual good. Yes; 
but he who gives alms does not intend to buy heaven, because he knows 
that spiritual blessings are infinitely more valuable than his gifts; 
but he aims through charity to merit spiritual good. <p>

(2) The widow in the Gospel (S. Luke xxi. 1), in giving more according 
to her proportion, showed greater charity, from which the corporal 
works of mercy derive their spiritual efficacy.  <p>

<i>Are corporal works of mercy obligatory?</i><p>

That question is answered in the twenty-fifth chapter of 
<!--
Qu. XXXII. 5.] ALMS-GIVING. 223 
--><A NAME="p223"></a>
 the Gospel of S. Matthew. For some are punished with eternal penalty 
for the omission of the corporal works of mercy. The love of our 
neighbour is commanded; therefore all things without which that love 
cannot be preserved fall under the precept. But it pertains to that 
love not only that we will our neighbour's good, but also that we 
effect it. "Let us not love in word and in tongue, but in deed and in 
truth" (1 Ep. S. John iii. 18). This requires that we aid his necessity 
by giving of alms. But precepts are given respecting the acts of 
virtues, and the giving of alms falls under command as the act is 
necessary to the virtue; <i>sc.</i>, as right reason requires, 
considering both the giver and the receiver. On the one side, that 
which is to be given is what is superfluous; <i>i.e.</i>, over and 
above what is necessary for the giver's own sustenance. And I say 
"superfluous," not only as respects the individual giver, that which he 
needs for his own support, but also as regards others of whom he has 
charge. And that is to be considered as necessary for him (and for 
them) which is needful for their station in life. For each one is bound 
to provide first for himself and for those of whom he has charge, and 
afterwards out of the residue to aid the needs of others. <p>

And on the part of the recipient, he must have necessity, for otherwise 
there would be no reason for giving alms to him. But since it is not 
possible for any one to relieve the necessities of all, not every 
necessity falls under the precept, but only those where without others' 
aid the needy cannot be sustained. So, then, to give alms of 
superfluities falls under the precept, and likewise to give alms in 
case of extreme necessity. But otherwise alms-giving is of counsel, as 
counsels are given forthe attainment of higher spiritual good. <p>

(1) What, then, shall we say of the much talked-of rights of property? 
Temporal goods are Divinely conferred as regards ownership. But as 
regards the use of them they are not the owner's alone, but also they 
belong to others who can be sustained oat of the owner's superflui<!--
224 CHARITY. [Qu. xxxii. 6. 
 --><A NAME="p224"></a>ties. Well says S. Basil (Hom. in S. Luc. xii.), "If you say that 
your wealth is given to you by God, is He unjust in His distribution to 
us? Why have you abundance while your brother is in distress, unless 
that you may have the merit of being a good dispenser of the Divine 
bounty, and he be honoured with the prize of patience? It is the bread 
of the hungry which you are keeping; it is the clothing of the naked 
which you have under lock and key; it is the money of the needy which 
you have deposited in bank, or invested in stocks. You injuriously keep 
what you are able to give." <p>

(2) Another objection. Everything which falls under an affirmative 
precept obliges at some determined time, and then transgression is 
mortal sin. Therefore, if alms-giving is commanded, there will be some 
determinate time in which he sins mortally who does not give alms. But 
this does not appear to be so; because in every case it may be 
probably judged that the needy will be otherwise relieved, and what is 
called for by way of alms may prove to be necessary for the owner in 
the future, at least. But I reply that the determinate time when one 
sins mortally who refuses to give alms is the time when there is 
evident and urgent necessity, and no one appears ready to give aid. 
And, on the part of the giver, the time is when he has superfluities 
which are not necessary for his present situation according to his best 
judgment. Looking forward to all cases which may possibly occur in the 
future is contrary to the Divine command (S. Matt. vi. 84). The 
superfluous and the necessary must be judged according to the ordinary 
probabilities of things. <p>

The Fifth Commandment selects the most prominent example of giving aid 
to others in their need.  <p>

<i>Ought one to give alms out of what is necessary for himself?</i><p>

The Lord said (S. Matt. xix. 21), "If thou wouldst be perfect, go, sell 
that thou hast and give to the poor, and 
<!--
Qu. XXXII. 6.] ALMS-GIVING. 225  
--><A NAME="p225"></a>
 thou shalt have treasure in heaven." This shows that what is necessary 
may be given in alms. Bnt there are two kinds of necessaries (1) Those 
without which life is impossible. Such needful things may not be given 
away; say, if one has only what is absolutely needful for the support 
of his children and others dependent on him. To give away this is to 
destroy himself and his. A case may indeed occur where the safety of 
the Church or the state is concerned, and he may laudably expose 
himself and those belonging to him to peril of death, since the common 
good is to be preferred to one's own. But (2), in another way, a thing 
is said to he necessary when without it life cannot be suitably passed 
according to the state and condition of a person and of others for whom 
he is responsible. The limit of this necessity is not marked by a 
distinct line. If many things are added, you cannot say just when the 
line of the necessary is passed; if many things are taken away, still 
may remain all that is necessary for passing life becomingly according 
to one's proper state in it. To give alms out of these so-called 
necessities is good, and falls under counsel, not under precept. But it 
would be an inordinate act if one should withdraw so much from his 
property, in order to bestow it on others, that with the residue he 
could not properly fulfil the duties of his station in life. For no one 
ought to lead such a life as that would imply. <p>

But there are three exceptions to this statement (1) When one changes 
his state in life, <i>e.g.</i>, by entering on the "religious" life; 
for then he makes himself poor for Christ's sake (following the 
counsel, "If thou wouldst be perfect," etc.); (2) when those things 
which are withdrawn from the conveniences of life can be made up again; 
(3) when extreme necessity of any private person occurs, or grave 
necessity on the part of the commonwealth. For in these cases any one 
would laudably resign what is necessary for the decency of his state in 
life in order to provide for a greater necessity than his own.

<i>May alms he given of what is unjustly acquired?</i><p>

A thing may he illicitly acquired in either of three ways (1) Where what 
is acquired is due to him from whom it has been gotten, and cannot be 
retained by the one who has possession of it, as in robbery, theft, 
and usury. A man is bound to make restitution; he cannot give that 
away in alms. (2) But a thing may be illicitly acquired when he who has 
gotten it has no right to keep it, neither is it due to him from whom 
it has been obtained, because the one has taken it unjustly, and the 
other has unjustly given it. This is the case in simony, where both 
giver and receiver violate the justice of Divine law; restitution 
ought not to be made, but the gift should be bestowed in alms. This is 
true in all cases where both the giving and the receiving are contrary 
to law. (3) A thing may be illicitly acquired when the getting is 
itself lawful, but that from which it is acquired is unlawful, as in 
all cases of base contract, <i>"turpe lucrum;" e.g.</i>, a prostitute 
shamefully breaks the law of God, but in receiving money she does not 
act unjustly, or contrary to law. What is in such ways illicitly gained 
may be kept, and alms given out of it. <p>

(1) The mammon of unrighteousness of which the Lord speaks (S. Luke 
xvi. 9) is not riches unjustly acquired. <p>

(2) What shall we say of the gains of gambling? Some things are 
forbidden by Divine law; <i>sc.</i>, getting the money of those who, 
like minors, have no power to alienate what is theirs; enticing 
another to gamble, with the motive of cupidity in the heart, or getting 
fraudulent gains; these call for restitution, not alms-giving. But 
something further is forbidden by civil law, and where such law is 
extant, and not obsolete, restitution is obligatory, unless the one has 
lost who through cupidity enticed to gamble. He is unworthy to receive; 
the other cannot lawfully keep. In such a case they must have recourse 
to alms-giving. <p>

Wives, children, servants, cannot give alms from what is not their own,

<i>Who are first to receive alms?</i><p>

First, those who are most closely connected with us, discretion being 
used with respect to the degree of connection, of holiness, of utility. 
For to one much holier, suffering greater need, and more useful to the 
common weal, alms should be given in preference to the person nearer in 
kinship, especially if the latter is not very near by blood 
relationship, and is not specially under our care, and if the necessity 
is not grave. <p>

"If thou hast much, give plenteously," in proportion to thy means, not 
for the superfluity of the recipient.  <p>

<h4>&sect; 11. Fraternal correction.</h4> <p>

<i>Is it an act of charity?</i><p>

Sin may be viewed either as injurious to the sinner, or as doing harm 
to others who are injured or scandalized by it, and also as doing harm 
to the common good. There is, therefore, a two-fold correction of the 
delinquent; one which applies a remedy to the sin as an evil in the 
sinner, and that is properly fraternal correction which is ordained for 
the amendment of the delinquent. But removing evil from any one is 
equivalent to procuring his good, which is a work of charity. Hence, 
fraternal correction also is a work of charity, because hy it we repel 
evil from our brother; so., sin. And the removal of that is a greater 
work of charity than removing outward loss or corporal injury. 
Fraternal correction, therefore, is a nobler act of charity than the 
cure of bodily infirmity or the relieving of outward need. <p>

But there is another kind of correction which is an act of justice; 
viz., the applying a remedy for the sin as it is an evil against 
others, and especially as it is injurious to the common weal. 
<!--
228 CHARITY. [Qu. XXXIII. 2.  
--><A NAME="p228"></a>
 Fraternal correction is not opposed to the "bearing one another's 
burdens" (Gal. vi. 2), but rather flows from it. For one supports the 
erring when he is not turned against him, but keeps such good will 
towards him that he tries to amend him.  <p>

<i>Fraternal correction is obligatory.</i><p>

But once more note the distinction between affirmative and negative 
commands. As the negative prohibit the acts of sins, so the affirmative 
lead to the acts of virtues. But the acts of sin are in themselves 
evil; they cannot become good in any manner, time, or place. For in 
themselves they are joined to a bad end. Therefore, negative laws bind 
always, on all occasions, under all circumstances. But the acts of 
virtues ought not to be done in every manner, but with observation of 
those due circumstances which are requisite in order that the act may 
be a virtuous one; <i>sc.</i>, thatit be done where it ought, and when 
it ought, and in the manner it ought to be done. And because the due 
arrangement of the means depends upon the end songht for, in those 
circumstances of virtuous action is chiefly to be noted the end, which 
is the good of virtue. If, therefore, there be any such omission of any 
circumstance of a virtuous act as totally takes away the good of 
virtue, this act is contrary to the precept. But if there be defect in 
any circumstance which does not totally annul the virtue, though the 
act may not reach the perfect good of virtue, it is not contrary to the 
precept. So fraternal correction, which is ordained for the amendment 
of a brother, falls under the law (obligation) so far as it is deemed 
to be necessary for that end, but not so that the delinquent must be 
corrected in every place, and at every time. <sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup>

(1) But, this, you say, proposes a task which is practically 
impossible. Yes; man's operation cannot be efficacious without Divine 
aid, and yet we are bound to do our part, so far as in us lies, with 
hope of Divine assistance. <p>

(2) In one way, it may be meritoriously omitted out of charity, when an 
opportune season is waited for, or there is reasonable fear of making 
the offender worse, etc. But, again, its neglect is mortal sin when 
fear of being unpopular or of some annoyance is preferred to fraternal 
charity, although one has reason to think that his correction will be a 
benefit to the sinner. In another way, omission of this is venial sin, 
when fear or other motive makes one more tardy in correcting his 
brother's faults, not, however, that he would neglect it if he were 
certain of doing good thereby. <p>

(3) It cannot be said that if fraternal correction is obligatory, it is 
a debt which must be paid; and therefore, as in the case of any other 
debt, we must go around and search for our creditors, which in this 
case is impossible, because of the multitude of sinners, for whose 
correction one man is not sufficient. This is mistaken, because what is 
due to any determinate and fixed person must be paid, whether it is 
corporal or spiritual good, without waiting for him to come to us, but 
having due solicitude in seeking him out. This is true of pecuniary 
debt, and of one who has special charge of another. He ought to seek 
out that other if he go astray. But in the case of those benefits, 
spiritual or corporal, which are not due to any certain person, but to 
all our neighbours in general, we are not bound to go around searching 
for those to whom we may pay our debt, but it suffices that we do so 
when we meet with them.  <p>

<i>Does fraternal correction pertain only to those who hold some 
office?</i><p>

We have seen above that one kind of correction is an act 
<!--
230 CHARITY. [Qu. XXXIII. 4, 5. 
--><A NAME="p230"></a>
 of charity; viz., that which specially tends to the amendment of an 
erring brother by simple admonition. Such correction is the duty of 
every one who has charity, whether he is in office or not. <p>

But there is another kind of correction, which is an act of justice 
aiming at the common good, which common good is sought for not only by 
fraternal correction, but sometimes by punishment, in order that others 
may be afraid and cease to do wrong. Such correction pertains to 
governors alone, whose duty it is not only to admonish, but also to 
correct by punishing. <p>

(1) Though fraternal correction pertains to all, yet those who have 
charge of others have graver responsibility in that respect. <p>

(2) But he who has sound judgment is superior in that respect, and is 
bound to employ it in this way.  <p>

<i>Is any one bound to correct his superior?</i><p>

We are not now speaking of the act of justice, which belongs to one in 
office alone, but of the act of charity, which embraces all to whom 
charity is due, if in any one is found what ought to be corrected. But 
because a virtuous act must be restricted to the due circumstances, 
therefore in correction of superiors a due mode must be employed, 
<i>sc.</i>, not rudeness and insolence, but mildness and respectfulness 
(1 Tim. v. I).  <p>

<i>How can a sinner correct the delinquent?</i><p>

Such correction belongs to him who has sound judgment. But sin does not 
totally destroy the good of nature, and sound rational judgment may 
still remain. But yet previous sin puts a three-fold obstacle in the 
way of this correction (1) because preceding sin, especially if it be a 
greater one, renders a person unfit to correct the erring (S. Matt. 
vii. 3); (2) because of scandal, if the sin of the one who corrects is 
public; he seems to be correcting, not out 
<!--
Qu. XXXIII. 6.] FRATERNAL CORRECTION. 231. 
--><A NAME="p231"></a>
 of charity, but out of ostentation (S. Matt. vii. 5); 
(3) because of the pride of the corrector, who thinks lightly of his 
own sins and in his heart sets himself above his neighbour, judging 
others' sins with strict severity, as if he were a righteous man. Well 
says S. Augustine (Serm. Dom. in Monte, ii. 19), "Let us reflect, when 
necessity compels us to reprove another, whether we have never fallen 
in the same way; and then let us consider that we are human, and might 
have had the same fault; or that we once were under its dominion even 
if now we are not; and then let our common frailty come to mind, and 
pity, not hatred, precede that correction. But if we shall find that 
we, too, are guilty in the same way, let us not chide our brother, but 
lament with him our common sin, and not invite him to yield to us, but 
with us to avoid the common destruction." It is plain, then, that if 
the sinner correct the erring with humility, he does not sin anew and 
get for himself fresh condemnation, although in this way, either in his 
brother's conscience, or, at least, in his own, he may find himself 
worthy of condemnation for his past sins.  <p>

<i>May one give up fraternal correction through fear lest the erring be 
rendered worse by it?</i> <p>

That correction which is the duty of superiors is ordained for the 
common good and has coactive force. Such correction is not to be 
neglected for fear of troubling him who is corrected, both because he 
must be forced, if possible, through punishment to desist from his 
iniquity, if he will not amend of his own accord; and because, if he is 
incorrigible, the common good must be provided for, the order of 
justice being preserved, and others deterred by the example given. <p>

But fraternal correction is another thing; its end is amendment of the 
sinner, not through compulsion, but through simple admonition. 
Therefore, when it is probable that the sinner will not receive the 
admonition, but be 
<!--
232 CHARITY. [Qu. XXXIII. 7. 
--><A NAME="p232"></a>
 rendered worse by it, such correction is to he avoided, for the means 
to an end ought to be regulated by the end itself. If it hinder the 
end, it is not a good; it does not fall under the precept.  <p>

<i>The order of fraternal correction.</i><p>

The due order is commanded by our Lord Himself (S. Matt. xviii. 15) "If 
thy brother sin against thee, go, show him his fault between thee and 
him alone. If he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother. But if he 
hear thee not, take with thee one or two more, that at the mouth of two 
witnesses or three, every word may be established. And if he refuse to 
hear them, tell it unto the church." <p>

But we must distinguish between open and secret sins. If the sin is 
public, the remedy is not only for the sinner that he may be made 
better, but for others that they may not be scandalized. Such open sins 
are to be openly rebuked, as S. Paul says (1 Tim. v. 20), "Them that 
sin reprove in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear." 
But if the sins are secret, the Lord's command seems to apply to the 
case. For when thy brother sins against thee publicly, he sins not only 
against thee, but also against others. <p>

But even in secret sins there is a difference. For some may be offences 
against our neighbours when they produce injury, whether spiritual or 
corporal, to the community, as when any one secretly deals with the 
enemy in order to betray the nation, or when a heretic secretly tries 
to turn the faithful from the truth, he who secretly sins in such a 
manner sins not only against you, but also against others; and it is 
right to proceed at once to open denunciation, in order that the injury 
may be stopped, unless, possibly, you judge that private admonition 
will answer the purpose. <p>

But some sins are wholly between man and man, the injury being only 
that of the sinner and the one sinned against; and then the question is 
of aiding an erring 
<!--
Qu. XLIV. 1.] THE PRECEPTS OF CHARITY. 233 
--><A NAME="p233"></a>
 brother. And as the surgeon restores to health, if he can, without 
amputation (or ought to do so), but if he cannot, he amputates what can 
be lost for the preservation of life, so, also, he who aims at the 
amendment of his brother ought so to do it, if possible, that his 
brother's good name may be saved. For this is useful to him, both in an 
earthly way, since he would suffer great detriment from the loss of it, 
and in a spiritual way, because the dread of infamy helps to keep many 
back from sins into which they would rush without restraint if their 
good name were lost. <p>

For other reasons we are bound to preserve the good name of our erring 
brother. The ill name of one becomes the ill name of many. When 
something false is reported of one exercising sacred functions, or some 
true charge is made public, there are many who are eager to believe the 
same of all (S. Aug., Ep. ad plebem Hippon. 77). <p>

And, again, the sins of one made public encourage others to sin; 
notably, the sins of the clergy. <p>

But because a good conscience is of more value than a good name, the 
Lord willed that even with loss of good name the conscience of our 
brother should through public denunciation, if necessary, be freed from 
sin. It is commanded, then, that secret admonition precede public 
denunciation. <p>

Even God Himself gives the sinner secret warnings (Job xxxiii. 15).  <p>

<h4>&sect; 12. The precepts of charity.</h4><p>

<i>What God requires of us is the subject of commandment; but God requires 
that man love Him.</i><p>

Therefore, commandments are given respecting the acts of love. A 
precept implies a debt, something due. But something is due in two 
ways: one, <i>per se</i>; another, on account of something else. The 
end is what is due, <i>per se</i>, in each case, because it has, <i>per 
se</i>, the idea of the good 
<!--
234 CHARITY. [Qu. XLIV. 2. 
--><A NAME="p234"></a>
 but the means are due on account of something else. Thus, it is the 
physician's duty <i>per se</i> to try to make a cure; but it is his 
duty to give medicine on account of the cure. But the end of the 
spiritual life is that man may be united to God, which is done by 
charity, and all things which pertain to the spiritual life are 
ordained for this end. For all the virtues respecting whose acts 
precepts are given are ordained either to purify the heart from the 
filth of passions, or for a good conscience respecting our actions, or 
for a right faith, as those commandments which refer to Divine worship; 
and these three are the requisite conditions for loving God. For an 
impure heart is drawn away from His love by passions inclining to 
earthly things; and a bad conscience makes one shrink from a just God 
through fear of his punishments; and a false faith draws the affection 
to that which is not God, separating from His truth. But as the end is 
more precious than the means, the chief commandment regards the love 
which proceeds from charity. <p>

It might be objected that charity which is poured into our hearts by 
the Holy Ghost makes us free, for "where the Spirit of the Lord is, 
there is liberty" (2 Cor. iii. 17). But the obligation of commandments 
is not opposed to liberty except where the mind is averse to what is 
commanded, as in those who obey out of fear alone, while the precept of 
love can only be fulfilled out of our own will; and, therefore, it is 
not repugnant to liberty. <p>

Observe, also, that all the ten commandments are ordained for the acts 
of love to God and our neighbour. Therefore, the precepts of charity 
(as such) are not given there, but are included in all.  <p>

<i>The love of God, indeed, is the end, and that to which the love of our 
neighbour is ordained.</i><p>

But because all do not really see what is contained in the "first and 
great commandment," a second is added (which "is like unto it"); viz., 
the love of our neighbour. 
<!--
235 Qu. XLIV. 3.] THE PRECEPTS OF CHARITY.
--><A NAME="p235"></a>
  
<i>And these two are sufficient.</i><p>

"On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets" (S. Matt. 
xxii. 40), for the love of charity is love of the good; <i>sc.</i>, 
either of the end, or of that which is for the end, of God or of our 
neighbour for God's sake. <p>

(1) No precept respecting love of self and our own body is needed; but 
the mode of doing so -- <i>sc.</i>, in due order -- is implied in the 
love of God and of our neighbour. <p>

(2) Other acts of charity, as joy, peace, beneficence, follow from love 
as their cause. And precepts respecting these are, therefore, included 
in that of love. And yet, since some are slow to fulfil these, explicit 
precepts are added respecting them: "Rejoice in the Lord always" (Phil. 
iv. 4); "Follow peace with all men" (Heb. xii. 14) "While we have time, 
let us do good unto all men" (Gal. vi. 10). Different acts of doing 
good, also, are commanded - in Holy Scripture. <p>

God is to be loved as the ultimate end to which all things are 
referred. Therefore, He is to be loved with the whole heart. The whole 
heart, it is true, may not be actually and always directed to God. This 
is the perfection of the Christian's fatherland, not of the road 
thither. But the heart is to be habitually so directed to God that it 
receives nothing which is contrary to that love; this is the perfection 
"of the road," to which venial sin is not directly contradictory; since 
it does not totally destroy the habit of charity, it does not aim at 
the opposite, but only impedes the action of charity. <p>

Our intellect, our desires, our outward acts, are to be subject to that 
loving will which is expressed by loving God "with all the heart." 
Therefore it is added, "and with all thy mind, and soul, and strength." 
Fully and perfectly the precept of the love of God will be fulfilled in 
heaven, for its end is that man be totally united with God. But here, 
not so; yet there need be no departure from that end, no mortal sin. 
<!--
236 CHARITY. [Qu. XLIV. 7.  
--><A NAME="p236"></a><p>

Do not say that the impossible would be commanded, if the precept of 
perfect love could not be fulfilled in this life. For he that runs 
towards the goal must know which way he is to run. (See S. Aug., De 
Perf. Justit., cap. 8.)  <p>

<i>The precept of love of our neighbour gives the reason for loving and 
the manner of loving.</i><p>

It gives the reason; for others are our neighbours both according to 
the natural image of God and their capability of glory. Call others 
neighbours, call them brothers, it is all one. It gives the manner of 
loving -- <i>sc.</i>, "as thyself." This is not equality, but 
similitude, and that in three particulars; first, the end; as one 
loves himself (out of charity) for God's sake, so his brother is to be 
loved. This is holy love. Next, as one satisfies his own will in what 
is good (or thought to be so), so he yields to his neighbour in good 
things, not in evil. This is just love. And lastly, the reason for 
loving is that one love his neighbour not for his own benefit or 
pleasure, but wills his neighbour's good as he wills his own. This is 
true love. As thus understood, even enemies are brothers of ours.  <p>

<i>The order of charity is part of the precept.</i><p>

Man does more to gratify him whom he loves more. And so, if he should 
love less him whom he ought to love more, he would be doing more to 
satisfy him to whom he owes less; and so would be doing injury to the 
other. Accordingly, the order of love is explicitly laid down in Holy 
Scripture. " With all thy heart," places God above all things. "As 
thyself," places thine own salvation next. "We ought to lay down our 
lives for the brethren" (1 Ep. S. John iii. 16), places our neighbour 
before our own body. "Especially unto the household of faith" (Gal. vi. 
10), and, "If any provide not for his own, and specially his own 
household" (1 Tim. v. 8), places the better and those nearer to 
ourselves above other neighbours. 
<!--
237 Qu. XLV., XLVI.] THE PRECEPTS OF CHARITY.  
--><A NAME="p237"></a><p>

S. Thomas regards the spiritual gift of wisdom as especially correlated 
to charity. It is wisdom in the things of God, and he that has it can 
judge and order all his spiritual life by Divine rules. It is not 
merely speculative, but also eminently practical wisdom. Its seat is 
the intellect, but it springs from charity, a loving will. It is not 
the intellectual virtue which is acquired by our own efforts, and it is 
different from faith which assents to Divine verity; wisdom is 
judgment according to Divine truth. It is not the mere use of reason 
giving right judgment, but it is grounded on the affinity for Divine 
things which charity possesses through union with God. It is 
incompatible, therefore, with mortal sin. It is for the guidance of 
the spiritual life in what is necessary to salvation, through 
justifying grace, <i>"gratia gratum faciens."</i> <p>

The opposite sin is spiritual folly; not any natural dulness of 
judgment, but that stupidity of folly in spiritual things which results 
from a Christian man's burying himself in carnal pleasures. "The 
natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are 
foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are 
spiritually judged" (1 Cor. ii. 14). This child of lust 
(<i>"luxuria"</i>) may not be directly willed, but those things are 
willed from which it is necessarily generated and born. <p>
