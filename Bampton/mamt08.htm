<h2>Conclusion</h2><p>

MUCH more might be said of Modernism. What has been said is perhaps enough to indicate its radical error, and the effect of that error upon the Modernist endeavour to readjust Catholicity to modern thought. The initial error of Modernism is the error of Kant, that God and the supernatural are unattainable by intellectual knowledge. It has been pointed out in the foregoing lectures how that theory reappears again and again in Modernist teachings. But it is a theory which is fatal to the Catholic doctrine of faith, for faith is intellectual assent to supernatural truth revealed.
