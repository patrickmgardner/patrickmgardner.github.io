Of the following lectures some were delivered in Farm Street Church, some in the Westminster Cathedral, in the spring of the present year. They make no pretence of any profound or exhaustive treatment of their subject. They were addressed to a popular audience, and the subject was therefore handled in popular fashion. It is one which is much discussed by the general public at the present day, often with little real knowledge of its significance. The object of these lectures was to supply Catholics with as much information about Modernism as they need for their instruction and warning.  <p align="right">
