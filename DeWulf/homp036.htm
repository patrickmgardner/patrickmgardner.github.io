<b>36. Concept and Judgment.</b> -- The <i>concept</i> represents things under their abstract and general determinations, some proper to a single species of things, others common to different species of one and the same genus. Logic treats of the concept in so far as it becomes the element of the judgment. Thus, when Aristotle introduces into his logic the classification of beings into <i>Categories</i>, he takes the latter not for classes of things as they exist outside us (<b><a href="homp040.htm" target="xref">40</a></b>), but for classes of objective <i>concepts</i>, in so far as these can become the predicate or the subject of a judgment. The <i>Postpraedicamenta</i> are an addition made by the Aristotelian school. <p>

The judgment or enunciation (<b>apaphansis</b>) results from the union of two concepts, one of which (the predicate) is affirmed (or denied) of the other (the subject). The <i>Perihermeneias</i> (<b>peri herm&ecirc;neias</b>) studies the quality of judgments (affirmation, negation), their quantity (universality, particularity), their modality (necessity, possibility, contingency).
