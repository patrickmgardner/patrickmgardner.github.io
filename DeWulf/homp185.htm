<b>185. Isaac of Stella and Alcher of Clairvaux.</b> -- About the middle of the twelfth century there appeared two small treatises on psychology which are important as summing up the current psychological teaching of this first period. One, entitled <i>De Anima</i>, is in the form of a letter written about 1162 by ISAAC OF STELLA (born in England, became a Cistercian monk at

Citeaux, abbot of Stella about 1147, died about 1169). The other, known as <i>Liber de Spiritu et Anima</i>, is probably the reply of Isaac's correspondent, ALCHER OF CLAIRVAUX. The <i>De Anima</i> is a collection of rather disconnected views which were apparently drawn from their author by the insistence of Alcher.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> The <i>Liber de Spiritu et Anima</i>, on the contrary, is a well-arranged treatise which must have had a considerable didactic value, and is full of erudition besides.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Both authors were manifestly imbued with the spirit of the Augustinian psychology. The soul rules the body; its union with the body is a friendly union, though the latter impedes the full and free exercise of its activities; it is devoted to its prison.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> The powers of the soul are manifold, but none of them really distinct from the soul itself. We may decipher in it vestiges of the Blessed Trinity.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Alcher gives a long description of all the soul's activities, from the <i>vis vitalis</i> and <i>animalis</i> up to intelligence. Isaac has summarized the solution of the Universals problem in this significant formula: "secundae enim substantiae sunt in primis, sed primae <i>a</i> secundis".<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup>
