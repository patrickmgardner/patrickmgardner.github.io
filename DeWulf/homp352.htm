<b>352. Conclusion.</b> -- Bacon is faithful to scholasticism in the main drift of his teaching. But he espouses at least two fundamental theories which cannot be reconciled with scholasticism; hence it is that we give him a place apart in our classification. His denial of an autonomous value to philosophy runs directly counter to philosophy as conceived by the thirteenth-century scholastics. Then, too, his traditionalism and his theory of the <i>intellectus agens</i> seriously compromise the objectivity of knowledge and the soul's efficient causality: if God determines the <i>intellectus possibilis</i> to elicit the act of understanding, it is He who forms ideas in us; it is no longer the soul that abstracts them with the Divine concurrence.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a></a> The mind's native incapacity to reach truth, and the consequent necessity of a Divine revelation, recall the errors of De Bonald; but between him and Bacon there is this capital difference: for the former the revelation was made in the beginning and its data are transmitted by language; for the latter the revelation or illumination is special and varies from man to man. P&egrave;re Delorme, of the Friars Minor of Bordeaux (<b><a href="homp353.htm" target="xref">353</a></b>), tries at all costs to assimilate the philosophy of Bacon with that of the other Franciscans of the thirteenth century, and criticizes us -- with a suspicion of irony -- as having misrepresented Bacon in the first edition of the present work. A more careful consideration of the texts has only confirmed us in our view. P&egrave;re Delorme's article is not quite free from bias and inaccuracy. It is not true that Peckham, Scotus and St. Thomas adhered to Bacon's ideological teaching (p. 14): all three hold the <i>intellectus agens</i> to be a part of the soul (<i>cf.</i> <b><a href="homp359.htm" target="xref">359</a></b>). Nor is it true that no other scholastic attributed to reason any greater influence than Bacon did (p. 22); quite the contrary.<p>
