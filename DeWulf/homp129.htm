under the wise direction of Bishop FULBERT (960-1028), the greatest teacher of his time, and of IVES OF CHARTRES (fl. 1115) after him, passed through two separate periods of unrivalled excellence. Ahead of all the other schools, they competed with those of Paris itself down to the middle of the twelfth century. ADELMAN OF LI&Eacute;GE and BERENGAR OF TOURS studied under Fulbert at Chartres. In the twelfth century, the chancellors, BERNARD OF CHARTRES, GILBERT DE LA PORR&Eacute;E and THEODERIC OF CHARTRES, were among the most remarkable personalities of their time. In the ninth century Paris was the seat of three schools, Ste. Genevi&egrave;ve, S. Germain des Pr&eacute;s and the Cathedral school. The fame of these went on increasing steadily until, about the middle of the twelfth century, the French metropolis began to attract the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of the whole learned world, and by its superior lustre to extinguish gradually all rival centres of culture.
