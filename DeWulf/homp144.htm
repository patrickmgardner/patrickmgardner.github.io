<b>144. Rhaban Maur and Eric of Auxerre.</b> -- RHABAN MAUR (a pupil of Alcuin at Tours, then teacher at Fulda, where he had among his numerous auditors Servatus Lupus of Ferri&egrave;res) did not go beyond the general assertions just referred to. There is nothing in his encyclopedic collections (<b><a href="homp126.htm" target="xref">126</a></b>, 1), nor in the glosses which Cousin attributes to him<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> on the <i>Isagoge</i> and the <i>De Interpretatione</i>, nor in his treatise on <i>The Proposition</i>, that he did not learn from Bo&euml;thius. He teaches that universal terms signify neither sensations nor things, but notions, and that the universal has no essence other than that of the individual things of sense.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

ERIC OF AUXERRE (who flourished about the middle of the ninth century, studying under Servatus Lupus of Ferri&egrave;es and Rhaban Maur at Fulda before he opened school at Auxerre) reflects the same general tendencies in the glosses of which he is the reputed author. Haur&eacute;au attributes to him commentaries on the <i>De Interpretatione</i>, on Pseudo-Augustine's <i>Dialectic</i> and <i>Book an the Ten Categories</i>, on the <i>Isagoge</i>, on the Latin text <i>De Syllogismo</i> of Apuleius, and on various works of Bo&euml;thius. According to Professor Baeumker, only portions of the glosses on the <i>Categories of Pseudo-Augustine</i> can be attributed to Eric.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

An anonymous commentary on Martianus Capella, written by a contemporary of Eric and brought to light by Victor Cousin, may be mentioned among the anti-realistic productions of this period. <p>

<a name="n_3"><a href="#n3">{3}</a></a> DR. BAEUMKER has promised an edition of those glosses. CLERVAL (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 165) attributes them to a disciple of Rhaban Maur.<p>
