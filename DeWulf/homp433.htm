<b>433. Conclusion.</b> -- Those Renaissance Aristotelians who attempted to reconstitute Aristotelianism according to the text of Aristotle himself, failed miserably in their endeavours. On the other hand, the Alexandrists and Averro&iuml;sts made little scruple of interpreting to suit their own prejudices, the teaching of Alexander of Aphrodisias and Averroes -- themselves untrustworthy interpreters of the Stagirite. Hence we may say of all the non-scholastic Aristotelianism of the Renaissance that <i>in so far as it claims to be a genuine restoration of Peripateticism</i> it is simply belied by the testimony of history.<p>
