<b>360. Ontologism.</b> -- The ideology of Bacon and Marston is tainted with Ontologism. This erroneous theory, according to which the intellect would see directly in God Himself the objects of its ideas, was not without its defenders in the medieval schools. We find in the writings of the leading scholastics repeated refutations of ontologism;<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> and among the 219 propositions condemned in 1277, we also find mention of ontologistic doctrines. The names of the medieval ontologists are, however, unknown to us. <p>
