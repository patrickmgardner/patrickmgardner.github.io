<b>30. Art and the Beautiful.</b> -- Plato is the world's first great theorist of the beautiful. His esthetics, however, partake of the fragmentary character common to all Greek esthetics. He leaves in obscurity all the <i>subjective</i> problems suggested by the psychological, fascinating element of the beautiful, and discusses by preference the various metaphysical questions regarding the <i>objective</i> elements of beauty. These latter are identified with order and the constituents of order, namely, proportion, symmetry, and harmony.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> In fact, arithmetical and geometrical relations are regarded by Plato as the very essence of beauty (25, 26). Moreover, the beautiful and the good are identical (<b>kalokagathia</b>), for the former is merely an aspect or manifestation of the latter in the physical, and more especially in the moral, orders. <p>

shadow, since physical nature itself is nothing more than a faint reflex of supra-material reality. It is unworthy of being cultivated for its own sake. Strange words these in the mouth of a poet!

The State can veto all art innovations and is bound to see that art does not become an instrument of moral corruption.<p>
