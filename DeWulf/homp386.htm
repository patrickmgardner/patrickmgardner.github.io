<b>386. Leading Scotists.</b> -- FRANCIS OF MAYRON (fl. 1325) was the first -- and the worst -- of those misguided Scotists who destroyed the master's metaphysics with a crop of subtle and chimerical entities that provoked the attacks of Thomists and Ockamists; he was the most characteristic and influential of the immediate followers of Scotus, and by his exaggeration of his master's principles he got the title of <i>Magister Acutus Abstractionum</i>.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Besides him we may mention, among the principal Scotists of the fourteenth century, the Franciscans ANTONIO ANDREAE (<i>Doctor Dulcifluus</i>, fl. 1320), JOHANNES CANONICUS (fl. 1320), JOHN DE LA RIVE, GERARD ODO, JOHN OF BASSOLES, one of Scotus's favourite pupils, JOHN DUMBLETON, NICHOLAS OF LYRE (fl. 1349).<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> WALTER BURLEIGH (<i>Galterus Burlaeus</i>, called <i>Doctor planus et perspicuus</i>, 1275-1342), a secular cleric, wrote commentaries on Aristotle, in which he defended a sort of realism resembling that of St. Thomas. He is the author of a number of <i>Tractatus Philosophici</i> often attributed to St. Bonaventure.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> ALEXANDER OF ALEXANDRIA (fl. 1314), author of <i>Commentaries on Aristotle's Metaphysics</i> (<b><a href="homp260.htm" target="xref">260</a></b>, p. 382, n. s), professed pure Scotism; and the same may be said of LYCHETUS OF BRESCIA, who commentated the <i>Opus Oxoniense</i>

towards the end of the fourteenth century, and of NICHOLAS DE ORBELLIS (fl. 1455), whose commentary on the Sentences was adopted as text-book in the Franciscan schools of the fifteenth century. <p>

The Scotist school was never so widespread as its more powerful rivals.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>
