<b>444. Zwingli</b> -- the great Swiss reformer (1484-1531), was at one with Luther in making justification by faith alone the basis of the new Christianity. Zwingli was an ardent humanist; he visited Italy and drank in the spirit of the Florentine Academy; his favourite author was Pico of Mirandola. He drew upon Neo-Platonism and Stoicism in defence of his dogma. Both systems suggested pantheistic immanence and the deification of man regenerated by the sovereign good. Seneca supplied him with arguments for the autonomy of the will, for absolute predestination of both the good and the wicked, and for moral determinism (<b><a href="homp072.htm" target="xref">72</a></b>). Universal theism, or the unity of the Divine revelation throughout all the religions of the world, suggested itself to Zwingli as the natural conciliation of humanism and Protestantism.
