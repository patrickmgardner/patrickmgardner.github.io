change of things occupies the attention of the representatives of this second group. Here we meet: (1) <i>Ionic Dynamism</i>, or the theories propounded by the new Ionic School after Heraclitus; and (2) the <i>Mechanicist</i> or <i>Atomist</i> theories of (a) Empedocles, (b) of the Atomist School, (c) of Anaxagoras. <p>

Dynamism is opposed to Mechanicism or Atomism. Both systems were, no doubt, contemporaneous with the earliest speculations of Grecian philosophy, but as they regard the <i>processus</i> of things the exposition of their principles belongs rather to this second phase of Pre-Socratic Cosmology. <p>

In its widest sense, <i>physical dynamism</i> embraces these two propositions: (1) the things of nature develop under the influence of one or more internal principles of activity; (2) where these principles are manifold they differ among themselves <i>qualitatively</i> in the various beings and their phenomena. <p>

The fundamental ideas of atomism can be also reduced to two principles: (1) In the various things of nature there is <i>material mass</i>, and there is <i>motion</i>. The parts of the material mass are <i>qualitatively homogeneous</i>, and their differentiation <i>in size and shape</i> explains the diversity of the various beings and phenomena in the world. This differentiation of parts results from <i>mechanical motion</i>. (2) The motion that animates the various parts of the whole mass of matter is <i>communicated</i>, that is to say, it is not the product of any energy proper to the mass, this latter being inert.
