<h2>Medieval Philosophy.</h2>
<h3>Introductory Considerations.</h3><p>

&sect; 1. GENERAL REMARKS.<p>  

<b>106. Scholastic Philosophy and Scholastic Theology.</b> -- Scholastic <i>philosophy</i>, which represents medieval philosophy <i>par excellence</i>, naturally consists, like every other philosophy, in a <i>rational investigation</i> of all or some of the problems raised by any attempt to explain fully the universal order of things. We find that <i>scholastic philosophy</i> is almost always confounded with <i>scholastic theology</i>, which, in its dogmatic aspect, is a body of <i>doctrines received through a positive revelation from God</i>. <p>

This confusion would entirely pervert the meaning of the historical study we have undertaken in those pages; for it would make the history of medieval philosophy a department of the history of religions. It is expressly condemned by the princes of philosophy in the thirteenth century, who laid down clearly the <i>distinction</i> between the philosophical and theological sciences. Their theory on this point will be expounded when we come to treat of the scholastic synthesis (see Second Period). <p>

In the present history there is question of scholastic philosophy, and of scholastic philosophy alone. When we employ the term <i>scholasticism</i> simply, it is to be taken as synonymous with scholastic philosophy.
