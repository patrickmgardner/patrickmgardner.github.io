<b>322. Henry of Ghent: His Life and Works.</b> -- Recent research has revolutionized the traditional biography of HENRY OF GHENT, <i> "Doctor Solemnis,"</i> and exploded the old legends which made him a member of the Goethals family at Ghent, of the Servite order, and of the Sorbonne. The exact year of his birth is unknown. He was canon at Tournai in 1267, archdeacon at Bruges in 1276, and from about this date took a prominent part in the University life of Paris. His name appears in many important decisions. In 1282 he took sides openly against the ecclesiastical privileges of the mendicant orders. He became doctor of theology in 1277 and died in 1293. His principal works are the <i>Summa Theologica</i> and the <i>Quodlibeta</i>. The latter are especially interesting as a tableau of the principal questions disputed at Paris towards the end of the thirteenth century.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> Several of his quodlibetic disputes synchronized with those of his countryman, Godfrey of Fontaines, and the correspondence of the theses defended by the one and attacked by the other, cannot escape notice.  

<a name="n_3"><a href="#n3">{3}</a></a> A commentary of his on the <i>Physics</i> of Aristotle and a <i>Treatise on Logic</i> have come down to us in MS. The Escurial Library possesses his <i>Quaestiones super Metaphysicam Aristotelis</i>. The <i>Liber de Scriptoribus Illustribus</i>, for a long time attributed to him, is probably not his work.<p>
