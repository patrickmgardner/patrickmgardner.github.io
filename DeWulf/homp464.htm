&sect; 5. THE SCOTIST SCHOOL.<p>

<b>464. Principal Scotists.</b> -- Scotism remained the favourite system of the Franciscan order. There are no very noteworthy names among the earlier Scotists of this period. We may mention the Franciscans, NICHOLAS BONETUS at Venice (fl. 1360), PETER THOMAS (wrote <i>Formalitates</i>), JOHN THE ENGLISHMAN (1483, wrote a commentary on the <i>Quaest. de Universalibus</i> of D. Scotus), ANTONIUS SIRECTUS (1484) and NICHOLAS TINCTOR, all extreme formalists. The editor of the latter's commentaries calls him <i>Scotisans subtilis plurimum</i>. STEPHANUS BRULIFER is more reserved, whilst THOMAS BRICOT and GEORGE OF BRUSSELS -- a pair whose works are closely related -- incline towards terminism. The same is true of JOHANNES FABER DE WERDEA (1500) and of PETRUS TARTARETUS (1494), the most remarkable Scotist of his time, author of commentaries on the Physics and Ethics of Aristotle, on the <i>Sentences</i> of Peter Lombard and on the <i>Quodlibeta</i> of Duns Scotus. PETRUS DE AQUILA, author of a <i>Scoteilus</i>, JOHANNES MAGISTRI (1432-1482) who wrote <i>Dicta . . . Introductoria in Doctrinam Doctoris Subtilis</i>, ANTONIUS TROMBETA (fl. 1518), who has left a treatise <i>In Scoti Formalitates</i>, MAURICE THE IRISHMAN, JOHN OF COLOGNE and a host of other secondary writers, advocate a return to the principles of pure Scotism. Towards the opening of the seventeenth

century this ardent advocacy of Scotism was perpetuated by J. PONCIUS MASTRIUS, PH. FABER (fl. 1630), BELLUTUS (fl. 1676), and above all by CLAUDIUS FRASSEN (1620-1711), doctor of the Sorbonne and author of a <i>Scotus Academicus</i>, and HIERONYMUS DE MONTEFORTINO, whose <i>Summa Theologica</i>, published in 1720, follows the plan of the <i>Summa Theologica</i> of St. Thomas.
