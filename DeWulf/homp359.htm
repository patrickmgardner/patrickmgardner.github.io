<b>359. Vestiges of Averro&iuml;sm.</b> -- It is evident from the ideology of Bacon and Marston that the discussions on the active intellect had given rise to an equivocal terminology in the schools, since for some this meant a faculty of the soul, for others God Himself, for the Averro&iuml;sts an independent substance. Even in scholastic circles, where the active intellect was regarded as a faculty of the soul, <i>pars animae</i>, concessions were made to the formulas of Averro&iuml;sm, though not to its <i>doctrine</i>. As an illustration of this we may refer to two texts from St. Thomas, which have often been interpreted in a wrong and unfavourable sense.
<!--
VESTIGES OF AVERROISM 409 
--><A NAME="p409"></a>
The first is from an article in the <i>Summa Theologica</i>,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> where the doctrinal question "utrum intellectus agens sit aliquid animae" is plainly proposed and no less plainly answered: "respondeo dicendum quod intellectus agens de quo Philosophus loquitur, est aliquid animae". Which does not prevent us, continues St. Thomas in answer to a difficulty drawn from texts of Aristotle, from calling God, <i>as First Cause</i>, the <i>intellectus agens</i> of our souls. But he takes care to add that we are also endowed with created active intellects, the work of the Increated active intellect. <i>For otherwise man alone would be an exception to the law that contingent beings carry within them the principle of their activities</i>.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> The thought of the Angelic Doctor is perfectly clear: only prejudice could lead to a misconstruction of it. <p>

The second text, occurring in the <i>Commentary on Book II. of the Sentences</i>,<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> refers to an attempted adaptation of the same formula to a point in theology. Having remarked that most philosophers after Aristotle agree in recognizing a substantial distinction between the active and the possible intellects, and make supreme happiness consist in the union of man with the active intellect, St. Thomas adds: "Quidam catholici doctores, corrigentes hanc opinionem et partim sequentes, satis probabiliter posuerunt <i>ipsum Deum esse intellectum agentem; quia per applicationem ad ipsum anima nostra beata est</i>". The latter words and the whole context show that there is question here of the <i>supernatural</i> order. These theologians call God the <i>intellectus agens</i>, inasmuch as the possession of Him by the understanding constitutes beatitude. In the <i>natural</i> order God is not the <i>intellectus agens</i> of our souls. St. Thomas takes care to <i>demonstrate</i> this, in the same article, lest he should be misunderstood. And he concludes with these words: "Et ideo, remotis omnibus praedictis erroribus, dico . . . intellectum possibilem . . . in diversis diversum esse, et multiplicari secundum divisionem materiae in diversis individuis . . . et superaddo etiam intellectum agentem esse in diversis diversum".<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup>  <p>
