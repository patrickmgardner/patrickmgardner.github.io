<b>150. Philosophy and Theology.</b> -- The spirit of St. Augustine breathes through the formulas that give expression to St. Anselm's theory here. <i>Crede ut intelligas.</i> That is to say, firstly, that faith goes before reason inasmuch as it is the purifier of the soul; but, secondly and especially, that faith must be perfected and completed by a rational study of the contents of revelation; in other words, that philosophy should be at the service of theology. Applying this principle himself, Anselm undertook to give a rational justification of dogma, making some reserves, however, in regard to the demonstrative force of his arguments. "He borders unconsciously on rationalism, without falling into it."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

In his investigations he is brought face to face with numerous philosophical questions. "St. Anselm thought he was writing only theology; in reality he was also developing the germ of a distinct system of philosophy."<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Domet de Vorges remarks that in the thought of St. Anselm the aphorism has a wider scope and applies to the dispositions of all who want to attain to truth: "to believe in the truth is a necessary disposition -for discovering it" (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 135). <p>
