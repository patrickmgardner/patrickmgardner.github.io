<b>466. Other Scholastic Groups.</b> -- About the middle of the sixteenth century the Capuchins and Conventuals returned to the teaching of St. Bonaventure, the "ancient" teaching, which the success of Thomism and Scotism had so long eclipsed, even in the Franciscan order itself. In the year 1622, LONGUS DE CORIOLES published a work on the <i>Summa</i> of St. Bonaventure, which led to the compilation of a lengthy series of commentaries on the Seraphic Doctor's writings. <p>

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there also reappeared a <i>Schola AEgidiana</i> in which we meet AEGIDIUS DE VITERBO (fl. 1532), RAPHAEL BONHERBA, etc. Certain of the Hermits of St. Augustine, with ESTACIO DI TRINIDADE (born 1676 in Lisbon, author of a <i>Summa Totius Philos. ex Doctrina D. Thomae extracta</i>), joined the Spanish revival movement. The constitution of 1560 recognized St. Thomas as second patron of the order. <p>

Henry of Ghent -- after a long spell of oblivion -- came into favour once more in the seventeenth century, when the Servites of Mary, espousing a legend which represented the <i>Doctor Solemnis</i> as a member of their order, adopted his philosophy as their official teaching. It received commentaries -- all of which are published --

Finally many of the Benedictine communities followed the philosophy of St. Anselm.
