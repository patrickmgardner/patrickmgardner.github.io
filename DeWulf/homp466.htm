<b>466. Other Scholastic Groups.</b> -- About the middle of the sixteenth century the Capuchins and Conventuals returned to the teaching of St. Bonaventure, the "ancient" teaching, which the success of Thomism and Scotism had so long eclipsed, even in the Franciscan order itself. In the year 1622, LONGUS DE CORIOLES published a work on the <i>Summa</i> of St. Bonaventure, which led to the compilation of a lengthy series of commentaries on the Seraphic Doctor's writings. <p>

Thomae extracta</i>), joined the Spanish revival movement. The constitution of 1560 recognized St. Thomas as second patron of the order. <p>

Henry of Ghent -- after a long spell of oblivion -- came into favour once more in the seventeenth century, when the Servites of Mary, espousing a legend which represented the <i>Doctor Solemnis</i> as a member of their order, adopted his philosophy as their official teaching. It received commentaries -- all of which are published --

Finally many of the Benedictine communities followed the philosophy of St. Anselm.
