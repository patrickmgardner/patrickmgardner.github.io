<b>31. Conclusion.</b> -- In laying down the fundamental principle of his dialectic, Plato shows himself wanting both in moderation and in largeness of view. And since the remainder of his philosophy is of a piece with the dialectic, all alike is marred by a sort of narrow exclusiveness which leads him over and over again to the juxtaposition of extremes that are irreconcilable: to the dualism of God and the Good, of Matter and Idea, of the phenomenal and the Ideal worlds, of body and soul, of common virtue and philosophical virtue, of the individual and the State. Nor are those reconciling or intermediary principles to which Plato has recourse (world-soul, composition of the soul in man, philosophical despotism) equal to the task of removing, diminishing or even successfully concealing the inconsistencies of his system. <p>

Plato's philosophy found a long line of supporters in the earlier and succeeding Academicians: but these are as dwarfs beside the giant figure of Aristotle.<p>
