<b>456. The Dominicans.</b> -- To FRANCIS OF VITTORIA (1480-1566) belongs the honour of having initiated the new orientation of scholasticism at the University of Salamanca. He had studied at Paris, under a scholastic of some genius, Peter Crockaert of Brussels (<b><a href="homp452.htm" target="xref">452</a></b>). Vittoria not only advocated a return to the

SPANISH SCHOLASTICISM 493 
--><A NAME="p493"></a>
teachings of pure Thomism, but endeavoured to rid scholasticism of the impure accretions that discredited the works of his contemporaries. He edited the commentaries of his master, Crockaert, on the <i>IIa IIae</i> of St. Thomas. <p>

Vittoria gained a large following. MELCHIOR CANUS (1509-1560) and possibly DOMINICUS DE SOTO (1496-1560) count as his immediate disciples. Melchior Canus, professor at Alcala, was the most elegant writer of the whole group; his famous work, <i>De Locis Theologicis</i>, contains a complete scheme of reform for theology and philosophy. BARTHOLOMAEUS DE MEDINA (1527-1581) undertook a commentary on the <i>Summa Theologica</i>, which was to sum up those of his predecessors. His own work embraced only the <i>Ia IIae</i> and the <i>IIIa Pars</i> and was continued by DOMINICUS BANNEZ (1528-1604) who wrote on the <i>Ia</i> and the <i>IIa IIae</i>. Later on came the Italian, ZANARDI (fl. 1642), and the Portuguese Dominicans, ANTONIO DE SENA (fl. 1584, wrote on the <i>Summa</i> and the <i>Quaest. Disp.</i> of St. Thomas) and JOHN OF ST. THOMAS (1589-1644). This latter, a professor at Alcala and Salamanca, is well known from his excellent <i>Cursus Philosophicus ad exactam, veram et genuinam Aristotelis et Doctoris angelici mentem</i>, comprising logic, general and special physics and psychology.
