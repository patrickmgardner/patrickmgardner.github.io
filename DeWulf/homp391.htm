<b>391. The Aegidian School.</b> -- As an offshoot of Thomism, there arose in the fourteenth century an Aegidian school proper (<b><a href="homp321.htm" target="xref">321</a></b>).

GREGORY OF RIMINI (fl. 1358), the successor of Thomas of Strassburg, and who has also left Commentaries on the Sentences, brought about a doctrinal schism in the order. His teaching has close affinities with that of William of Ockam: intuitive and direct cognition of the individual; conceptualism; identity of the soul with its faculties; hylemorphic composition of all creatures; doubts about the demonstrative force of the arguments for the creative causality of God, etc. Gregory of Rimini had a following; but towards the middle of the fifteenth century, doctrinal unity was re-established in the order. It was mainly in Italy that the Aegidian school recruited its philosophers and theologians.
