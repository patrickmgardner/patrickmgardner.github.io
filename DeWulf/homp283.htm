<i>III. <i>Metaphysics and Theodicy.</i><p>

<b>283. The Categories and Transcendental Attributes.</b> -- The scholastic conception of metaphysics is taken from Aristotle (<b><a href="homp039.htm" target="xref">39</a></b>). Although it treats of Being as such, and is therefore the highest product of mental abstraction, it has nevertheless for its primary object the substance of the things of sense, and is thus anchored to the firm rock of reality. It adds to the peripatetic portion -- the general study of Being -- a new and original chapter on the transcendental notions. These are certain very wide and general aspects -- such as unity, truth, goodness (unum, verum, bonum) -- which bring out into bolder relief the content of the simple yet comprehensive concept of Being.
