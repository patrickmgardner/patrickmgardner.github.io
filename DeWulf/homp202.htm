<b>202. Sources of Medieval Mysticism.</b> -- The mystic elevations of St. Augustine (<b><a href="homp099.htm" target="xref">99</a></b>) found an echo in the Middle Ages. The <i>Stromata</i> and the <i>Pedagogus</i> of St. Clement of Alexandria, the <i>De Institutione Coenobiorum</i> of Cassian and the <i>De Vita Contemplativa</i> attributed to Prosper of Aquitaine, were additional sources of information to the medieval mystics. But it was primarily and mainly to Pseudo-Denis the Areopagite (in the version of Scotus Eriugena) that these had recourse; and we have already remarked that pantheistic as well as individualistic mysticism may be derived from the works of Pseudo-Denis (<b><a href="homp105.htm" target="xref">105</a></b>). Finally, from the close of the twelfth century the influence of Arabian mysticism (<b><a href="homp215.htm" target="xref">215</a></b> <i>sqq.</i>) began to make itself felt.
