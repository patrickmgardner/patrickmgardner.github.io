<b>374. Theodicy.</b> -- The very first page of Ockam's theodicy contains a bold application of his scepticism: the Existence, Unity and Infinity of God are indemonstrable by reason and must derive all their certitude from revelation. The attributes of God are in no way distinct from His essence: they are merely different names arbitrarily applied by us to the same identical reality: the <i>virtual</i> distinction of the Thomists has no more <i>real</i> foundation for it than the <i>formal</i> distinction of the Scotists. The same terminist influences colour his teaching on the Divine Ideas.
