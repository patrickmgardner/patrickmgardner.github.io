&sect; 3. ARISTOTLE.<p>

<b>32. Life and Works.</b> -- ARISTOTLE was born at Stagira (whence the name, <i>Stagirite</i>) in the year 384 B.C. Coming to Athens, he studied philosophy for twenty years under Plato. From that time he conceived the plan of his own system while continuing to profess a sincere respect for his master's teaching. After the death of the latter, Aristotle went to Atarneus and Mitylene; but the second important event in his life is his sojourn at the Macedonian court, whither he was called in 342 to direct the education of Alexander. About the year 335 he opened the peripatetic school in Athens. After the death of Alexander he was obliged to fly the city; he died in Chalcis in the year 322. <p>

His literary activity was prodigious. Apart from apocryphal and less important works we may classify his scientific writings under the following main headings <p>

I. Works on Logic, collected later on under the title of the <i>Organon</i>: (1) The <i>Categories</i> (<b>kat&ecirc;goriai</b>) or classes of concepts; (2) the treatise <i>On Interpretation</i> (<b>p. herm&ecirc;neias</b>) or on judgments and propositions -- authenticity sometimes questioned; (3) the <i>Two Analytics</i> (<b>analutika protera</b> and <b>hustera</b>), the one on reasoning, the other on demonstration; (4) the <i>Topics</i> (<b>topika</b>) which deal with "probable" or "dialectical" arguments, and to which he attaches his work on <i>Rhetoric</i>; (5) the <i>Sophistical Reasonings</i> (<b>peri sophistik&ocirc;n elegch&ocirc;n</b>), forming the ninth book of the <i>Topics</i> and dealing with sophisms in reasoning.

II. Works on Natural Philosophy and the natural sciences: (1) The <i>Physics</i> (<b>phusik&ecirc; akroasis</b>), comprising eight books, of which the seventh is apparently spurious; the <i>Book on the Heavens</i> (<b>peri ouranou</b>) ; the <i>Book on Generation and Corruption</i> (<b>p. geneseos kai phthoras</b> ); and the <i>Meteorology</i> (<b>mete&ocirc;rologika</b>): all of which treat of the general principles of the corporeal world. (2) The <i>History of Animals</i> (<b>p. ta z&ocirc;a historiai</b>), comprising ten books, of which three are not authentic; the Anatomic Descriptions (<b>anatomai</b>); the <i>Treatise on the Soul</i> (<b>peri psuch&ecirc;s</b>), and various minor treatises called the <i>Parva Naturalia</i> dealing with the soul; the <i>Parts of Animals</i> (<b>p. z&ocirc;&ocirc;n mori&ocirc;n</b>), the <i>Generation of Animals</i> (<b>p. z&ocirc;&ocirc;n genese&ocirc;s</b>), and the <i>Motion of Animals</i> (<b>p. z&ocirc;&ocirc;n poreias</b>): all bearing on the study of living things. Of all Aristotle's works, the <i>Treatise on the Soul</i> is the best written and most methodical. <p>

III. Works on Metaphysics: the <i>Metaphysics</i> (<b>ta meta ta phusika</b>). The word, <i>Metaphysics</i>, probably comes from Andronicus of Rhodes, who placed this portion of Aristotle's work after his writings on physics, <b>ta (biblia) meta ta phusika</b>. <p>

IV. Works on Moral Philosophy: (1) the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> (<b>&ecirc;thika Nikomacheia</b>); (2) the <i>Politics</i> (<b>politika</b>) and the <i>Athenian Constitntion</i> (<b>politeia Ath&ecirc;nai&ocirc;n</b>). The <i>Greater Ethics</i> and the <i>Eudemian Ethics</i> are probably the work of pupils. <p>

V. Works on Poetry: the <i>Poetics</i> (7. poi&ecirc;tik&ecirc;s</b>).  <p>

Aristotle's works were edited by Andronicus of Rhodes, towards the middle of the first century B.C. Among modern editions we may mention those of Didot (5 vols., Paris, 1848-1870), and the Berlin Academy 5 vols., 1831-1870). <p>
