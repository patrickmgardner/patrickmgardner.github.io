<b>118. Elements of a Complete Doctrinal Definition.</b> -- Scholastic philosophy is a synthesis or system, wherein all the questions of philosophy are treated and all their solutions harmonized, co-ordinated and made (<b>sun tith&ecirc;mi</b>) to stand together. An intrinsic, doctrinal definition of scholasticism should be based on these solutions. It must needs be complex, like the thing itself to be defined. Since the problems and answers were slowly evolved during the whole scholastic epoch, it will be better to hold over our suggested definition or outline of scholasticism until we have become acquainted with its doctrine as conceived by its ablest exponents at the period of its highest development. (See Second Period.)
