<b>431. The Averro&iuml;sts.</b> -- ALEXANDER ACHILLINUS (1463-1518, <i>De Intelligentiis, De Orbibus, De Universalibus</i>), AUGUSTINUS NIPHUS (1473-1546) and ZIMARA (died 1532) were the most noted among the Averro&iuml;sts of Padua at the beginning of the sixteenth century,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> not to mention the crowd of <i>litterati</i> of whom Petrarch speaks, and who thought it good taste to declare themselves Averro&iuml;sts. ACHILLINUS was called "the second Aristotle" on account of his commentaries on the Stagirite. NIPHUS was not a man of the same order of talent. After teaching pure monopsychism (<i>De Intellectu et Daemonibus</i>) like his master, NICOLETTO VERNIAS, and editing the works of Averro&euml;s (1495-1497), he modified his teaching to bring it into agreement with Catholicism. And when his rival, Pomponatius, began to teach in opposition to him, he was unable to defend the authority of Averro&euml;s against the latter's attacks. The <i>De Immortalitate Animae</i> (1518), in which Niphus replied to the similar work of Pomponatius (1516), is written in the spirit of the Lateran Council and borrows from Thomism its best arguments for Immortality. ZIMAEA was more open in his Averro&iuml;sm than Niphus. He wrote commentaries on Averro&euml;s and edited the works of John of Jandun (<b><a href="homp398.htm" target="xref">398</a></b>).<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> <p>
