<b>321. James of Viterbo.</b> -- When Giles was proclaimed official doctor of the Augustinian Hermits, he formed around him a <i>schola</i>

which grew to be very extensive in the following century. One of his earliest disciples was JAMES CAPOCCI OF VITERBO (<i>Jacobus de Viterbo, "Doctor Speculativus "</i>), who like his master must have attained to celebrity in his order, seeing that in the year 1293 he was entrusted for a second time (de novo) with a master's chair at Paris. He taught alongside Giles, and like the latter wrote some <i>Quodlibeta</i> and finally exchanged the doctor's cap for the mitre.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> In the official assessment of the academic library, published by the University on the 25th of February, 1304, we find the <i>Quodlibeta</i> of James classified along with those of Giles of Rome and Godfrey of Fontaines among the classic works of the time. James also wrote a <i>compendium</i> of the <i>Sentences</i> of Giles. In 1295 the order requested him to publish his own works <i>in sacra pagina.</i><sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> He seems to have followed closely the teaching of his master. His works are still unpublished and neglected.  <p>
