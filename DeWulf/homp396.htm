<h3>Chapter III.</h3>
<h4>Anti-Scholastic Philosophies.</h4><p>

<b>396. Various Forms of Anti-Scholasticism during this Period.</b> -- Averro&iuml;sm was still the most formidable rival scholasticism had to encounter in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries (&sect; 1). Then there arose also certain forms of heterodox mysticism of no great historical importance (&sect; 2). Finally we may note some parasitic systems, which, although not themselves durable, are symptoms of approaching decay (&sect; 3). The kinship of many of these latter with Averro&iuml;sm is easily recognized.  <p>
