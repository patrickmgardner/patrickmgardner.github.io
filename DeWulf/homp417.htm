<b>417. Life and Works.</b> -- NICHOLAS CHRYPFFS, born at Cusa (hence the name CUSANUS) in 1401, got his initiation into mysticism from Gerard Groot at Deventer, studied law at Padua (1424) and gave himself up largely to the pursuit of mathematics. Entering Holy Orders, he took part in the dispute about the respective rights of Popes and General Councils. Later on he received some important commissions from Pope Eugene IV. and was created cardinal by Nicholas V. (1448). He became bishop of Brixen in 1450 and got entangled in quarrels with the archduke Sigismund of Austria. He died at Todi in 1464. <p>

His busy and eventful life did not prevent Nicholas from devoting himself to science and philosophy. He has left very remarkable works on mathematics and astronomy. His principal works on philosophy are: <i>De Docta Ignorantia, Apologia Doctae Ignorantiae, De Conjecturis</i>.
