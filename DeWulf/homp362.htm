<b>362. Jewish Philosophy.</b> -- During the first half of the fourteenth century, the Jews of southern France continued to translate Averro&euml;s from Arabic into Hebrew. CALONYMUS OF ARLES, SAMUEL BEN JUDA BEN MESCHULLAM of Marseilles and TODROS TODROSI were the chief translators of this later school. There were also Hebrew versions of some of the works of Albert the Great, St. Thomas and Giles of Rome.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> LEVI BEN GERSON (born about 1288) and MOSES OF NARBONNE were the principal philosophers of this Proven&ccedil;al school. They wrote commentaries on Averro&euml;s, and original treatises, in which they fostered the rationalistic tendencies introduced by Maimonides. Thus, for instance, Levi ben Gerson unhesitatingly admits the eternity of the world.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

<a name="n_2"><a href="#n2">{2}</a></a> Renan writes of him: "His glosses were regarded by some of his disciples as inseparable from the text of Averro&euml;s, just as the latter was from that of Aristotle" (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 193). <p>
