<b>203. First Scholastic Mystics. St. Bernard.</b> -- The ordinary practice of asceticism, rather than the higher theme of mysticism proper, was studied by PAULINUS OF AQUILEIA, ODO OF CLUNY, ST. ANSELM OF CANTERBURY, HILDEBERT OF LAVARDIN and others of lesser importance. Some mystic theories are also to be found in RUPERT OF DEUTZ, HONORIUS OF AUTUN, ODO OF TOURNAI and WALTER OF LILLE; but the systematic study of the higher spheres of perfection originated in the twelfth century. <p>

The first great name that occurs is that of ST. BERNARD (<i>Doctor Mellifluus</i>, 1091-1153), who may be regarded as the founder of scientific mysticism. For him science is nought but a means of spiritual regeneration; the supreme object of life is the love of God: this comprises four degrees; and it is reached by twelve stages of humility. <p>

HONORIUS OF AUTUN is a complex personality, a solitary writer who lived through the second quarter of the twelfth century in the household of Christian, abbot of Ratisbon; a popularizer rather than a scholar; a poet too at times; his literary output -- on the most varied topics -- amounts to no less than thirty-eight distinct works or opuscula.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> <p>
