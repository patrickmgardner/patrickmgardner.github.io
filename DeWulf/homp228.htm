<b>228. Prohibitions of Aristotle's Works at Paris.</b> -- Early in the thirteenth century the works of Aristotle were repeatedly condemned by the ecclesiastical authorities. A council convoked at Paris in 1210 by Peter of Corbeil forbade the teaching, whether public or private, of the Natural Philosophy and the commentaries of Averro&euml;s (<i>nec libri Aristotelis de naturali philosophia nec commenta legantur Parisius publice vel secreto</i>),<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> at the same time as it condemned the teachings of Amalric of B&egrave;ne and ordered the <i>Quaternuli</i> of David of Dinant to be publicly burned. It is likely that the <i>libri de naturaliphilosophia</i> included not only the <i>Physics</i> of Aristotle, but also his <i>Metaphysics</i>. Five years later, the

Papal legate, Robert de Cour&ccedil;on, renewed these censures at the seat of the youthful university: while allowing the <i>Ethics</i>, he expressly prohibited the <i>Physics</i>, the <i>Metaphysics</i> and the <i>Summae de eisdem</i>.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> And this time again Aristotle was reckoned with the heretics: the followers of David, of Amalric and of Maurice of Spain.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

There were various reasons for those ecclesiastical censures. The immense volume of new philosophical material, brought to light by the introduction of the greater works of Aristotle, could not fail to produce confusion in the schools. The theologians became alarmed at certain teachings which ran counter to Catholic dogma: the theory of the eternity of the world, for instance. The Arabian commentaries aggravated the heterodoxy of those theories and introduced others that were no less objectionable, and always under cover of Aristotle. And then, too, the badly translated texts of Aristotle lent themselves to divergent interpretations, thus favouring the designs of all who wanted to propound novel or dangerous teachings (see Ch. IV.). <p>

As soon as the first panic subsided and the scholastics got time to make a closer acquaintance with the new peripatetic theories and see what in them was compatible with Catholic dogma and what not, the Church quietly relaxed the rigour of its early prohibitions. If these were not expressly withdrawn they were allowed to fall into disuse; the authorities took no notice of things, and so usage abrogated the law. In 1231 Pope Gregory IX., a sincere patron of learning, entrusted to three theologians (William of Auxerre, Simon of Authie and Stephen of Provins) the task of correcting the condemned books, evidently with the intention of putting the amended editions on the programme of the Paris Faculty of Arts, <i>ne utile per inutile vitietur</i>; and he delegated to the abbot of St. Victor and the prior of the Dominican

convent the power of absolving those who had incurred the ecclesiastical censures.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> These first steps seem to have been ineffectual; but from 1255 onward the Physics and Metaphysics were regularly prescribed by the Faculty of Arts for the University courses.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> The fact that the ecclesiastical authorities did not then interfere is a sufficient proof that the prohibitive measures were allowed to become and remain a dead letter; henceforward the authorities dealt only <i>post factum</i> with those who sheltered themselves behind the name of Aristotle for the purpose of teaching error. We may add that the censures of 1210 and 1215 had no binding force outside Paris,<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> and that the honour Aristotle received at Paris afterwards amply condoned for the suspicion with which he was treated there in the beginning. <p>

<a name="n_2"><a href="#n2">{2}</a></a> Robert de Cour&ccedil;on (fl. 1128) is the author of a Summa devoted to questions in moral theology and canon law. One of the most interesting portions of it, dealing with usury, has been published by G. LEF&Egrave;VRE, <i>Le trait&eacute; de Usura de Robert de Cour&ccedil;on</i> (LilIe, 1902). It is noteworthy that the author does not invoke (as later authors do) certain texts of the <i>Ethics</i> and the <i>Politics</i> in condemnation of usury. From this M. Lef&egrave;vre infers that the opposition to usury grew up spontaneously prior to the thirteenth century, without any support from the authority of Aristotle.<p>
