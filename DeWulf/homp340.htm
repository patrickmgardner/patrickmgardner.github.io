LATIN AVERRO&Iuml;SM 383  
--><A NAME="p383"></a>
<b>340. Supporters of Averro&iuml;sm.</b> -- The Averro&iuml;sts whose memory is preserved in the history of the thirteenth century, adopted an aggressive attitude towards scholasticism. These are: Siger of Brabant, in the first place; then, of lesser importance, Boethius the Dacian and Bernier of Nivelles. We know, moreover, that Siger had a strong following in the Paris Faculty of Arts,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> and the stirring episodes in the history of Averro&iuml;sm are a proof of the vitality of the anti-scholastic forces.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Then, outside the universities, Averro&iuml;sm also took root in the court of Frederick II. of Sicily and his son, Manfred (<b><a href="homp226.htm" target="xref">226</a></b>, II.). To Frederick is attributed the saying that Moses, Jesus and Mahommet were three impostors.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> There is no truth in Renan's contention<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> that the Franciscan schools were centres of Averro&iuml;sm (<b><a href="homp351.htm" target="xref">351</a></b>): the facts are all the other way. Renan failed to see that the doctrinal differences between the Franciscans and the Dominicans, at the time of the censures of 1277, all concerned the opposition of the older scholasticism to Thomism, and that the two great mendicant orders joined their forces in the fight against Averro&iuml;sm.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup>  <p>

<a name="n_3"><a href="#n3">{3}</a></a> The saying is referred to in the compilation <i>De Erroribus Philosophorum</i>, which attributes this error also to Averro&euml;s: "Quod nulla lex est vera, licet possit esse utilis" (MANDONNET'S edit., p. 11). <i>Cf.</i> decree of 1277, props. 174 and 175. <p>
