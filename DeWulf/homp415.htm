<b>415. Philosophical Teaching.</b> -- According to Raymond of Sabunde, man reads truth in two books, the book of Nature and the book of the Sacred Scriptures.

Inspired by a thirteenth-century conception (<b><a href="homp355.htm" target="xref">355</a></b>), it appeared at a critical epoch in scholasticism as a supreme but fruitless effort of the catholic mind to repulse the invasion of novel and dangerous tendencies.<p>
