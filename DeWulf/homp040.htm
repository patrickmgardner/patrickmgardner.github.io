<b>40. Being and the Ten Categories.</b> -- <i>Individual</i> things <i>alone</i> having reality (<b><a href="homp043.htm" target="xref">43</a></b>); the being which metaphysics studies by seizing on its <i>general</i> determinations, is simply the substance of the individual things (<b>tode ti</b>) presented to us in our sense-experience. There is in every being a primordial, constitutive element or basis, able to subsist by itself and which serves as a subject of inherence for all adventitious realities. Hence the first classification of beings into two categories, <i>substance</i> (<b>ousia</b>) and <i>accident</i> (<b>sumbeb&ecirc;kos</b>). Socrates is a substance; his virtue is an accident. The accident is next divided into nine categories; quality, quantity, relation, place, time, posture (<b>keisthai</b>), habit (<b>echein</b>) which is the possession resulting from change, action and passion implied in change (<b>poiein kai paschein</b>).<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

But to understand fully the scope of peripatetic metaphysics we must set this division, which is a statical one, over against another, which is a dynamic classification based on the <i>change</i> or <i>flux</i> of being: for the being which we know best and most fully is subject to change. Besides, each of the ten categories of being can be considered as in a state of change; it may be actual or potential.<p>
