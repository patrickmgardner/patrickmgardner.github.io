<b>87. Religious Phase of Neo-Platonism.</b> -- Porphyry's successors retained nothing of Neo-Platonism but a mystic craving after the supernatural. A sort of religiosity is the sole preoccupation of the Syrian IAMBLICHUS (died about 330), who reared on the foundations of Neo-Platonism a regular international Pantheon in which he placed all the divinities he ever heard of. The long line of philosophers who constitute the theurgical school of Iamblichus, extends to the fifth century A.D., that is, to the very end of the era of Grecian philosophy. Before Neo-Platonism finally disappeared it rallied for a time: this last manifestation of life reveals a third phase of its history, the encyclopedic period.
