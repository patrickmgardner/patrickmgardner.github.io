<h2>Grecian Philosophy.</h2><p>

<b>2. Division of Periods.</b> -- The Philosophy of Greece, embracing the six centuries before and the six centuries after Christ, forms a closed cycle in the history of human thought. Its beginnings coincide with the dawn, its decline with the wane of a civilization. It furnishes a remarkable illustration of the constant, rhythmic evolution of a movement of thought within the civilization of a single race of people. Grecian Philosophy may be divided into four periods on the basis of the great fundamental questions which came up successively for discussion : --<p>

First Period: from Thales of Miletus to Socrates (from the seventh to the fifth century B.C.). <p>

Second Period: Socrates, Plato and Aristotle (fifth and fourth centuries B.C.). <p>

Third Period: From the death of Aristotle to the rise of the Neo-Platonic School (from the end of the fourth century B.C. to the third century of the Christian Era). <p>

Fourth Period: The Neo-Platonic School (from the third century A.D., or, including the systems immediately preceding the Neo-Platonic, from the end of the first century B.C., to the close of the Ancient Grecian Philosophy in the sixth century A.D.). <p>

The distinguishing characteristics of each of those four periods will be respectively outlined in the following four chapters.  <p>
