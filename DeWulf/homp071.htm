<b>71. General Character and Division.</b> -- The Eclecticism of this period chose its theories by submitting them to the test of <i>convergence towards the practical ends of life</i>, and the supreme criterion of this convergence is <i>our immediate consciousness of it, the instinctive conviction we have of it independently of all other considerations, such as the real objectivity of knowledge</i>.

But it was not a matter of going back to the past; irresistible forces conspired to combine together those movements, which had issued from different starting-points. Passing over the eclecticism of the Epicurean school, where the master's doctrines were perpetuated almost intact, let us come to study the Stoic, Platonic, and Peripatetic forms of Eclecticism.
