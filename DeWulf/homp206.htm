<h5>ART. III. -- THE NON-SCHOLASTIC PHILOSOPHIES OF THE TWELFTH CENTURY.</h5><p>

<b>206. Various Forms of Non-scholastic Philosophy.</b> -- Every theory that denies the spirituality of the soul, or the personality of man, or the distinction between God and the creature, is subversive of the fundamental positions of scholasticism. Hence we must classify as adversaries of scholasticism all who teach materialism, or the transmigration of souls, or atheism, or pantheism.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a></a> We are happy to be able to quote in support of this classification the authority of Professor Baeumker of Strassburg: "Any historical system which in its thought-content and in its method of presentation falls completely outside the limits of this scholastic tradition -- as, for instance, mysticism and certain pantheistic systems, -- may indeed be included in medieval, but not in scholastic philosophy" (<i>Die Europ&auml;ische Philosophie des Mittelalters</i>, p. 290). <p>
