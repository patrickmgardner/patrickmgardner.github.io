<b>175. Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e.</b> -- GILBERT DE LA PORR&Eacute;E <i>(Porretanus)</i> was born at Poitiers in 1076, followed the lectures of Hilary of Poitiers and Anselm of Laon,

and was intimately acquainted with Bernard of Chartres, having lectured himself for over twelve years at the famous schools there. Subsequently he became <i>Scholasticus</i> at Paris (1141), and John of Salisbury, who followed his lectures there, assures us of the high esteem in which he was held at the great metropolis of learning. In 1142 Gilbert was appointed to the see of Poitiers, where he died in 1154. He did not abandon his professorial work immediately on assuming the duties of the episcopate.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

Among the numerous theological and philosophical works of Gilbert the most important are the <i>Liber Sex Principiorum</i> and two commentaries on the supposed Bo&euml;thian treatises <i>De Trinitate</i> and <i>De Duabus Naturis in Christo</i>. He is not the author of the book <i>De Causis</i>, attributed to him by Berthaud and Clerval.<p>

On Otto, <i>cf.</i> J. HASTAGEN, <i>Otto von Freising als Geschichtsphilosoph und Kirchenpolitiker</i> (Leipzig, 1900). The author examines the influences bearing on Otto's philosophy, pp. 6-22. Also J. SCHMIDLIN, <i>Die Philosophie Ottos von Freising</i> (Philos. Jahrb., 1905). <p>
