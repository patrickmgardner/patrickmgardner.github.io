<b>41. Potency and Act.</b> -- All change implies passing from one state to another. Consider a being B passing from the state a 
<!--

--><A NAME="p35"></a>
to the state <i>b</i>. If we analyse this change we see it demands that B already possess in <i>a</i> the <i>real principle</i> of its change to <i>b</i>: before being <i>b</i> it was capable of becoming <i>b</i>: it was really susceptible of a new determination: it was in the state of <i>potency</i> to be what it now is <i>actually</i>. <i>Act</i> is, therefore, the present sum of perfection or degree of being (<b>entelecheia, to enteles echein</b>). <i>Potency</i> or <i>potentiality</i>, is the aptitude to receive perfection (<b>dunamis</b>): it is imperfection and non-being if you will; but it is not mere nothingness, because this non-being is endowed with the germ of future actualization. This actualization or passage from a potential to an actual state is called <i>motion</i> or <i>movement</i>, and is defined by Aristotle: "the act of a being in potency, in so far as it is in potency; <b>he tou dunatou, he dunaton, entelecheia phaneron hoti kin&ecirc;sis estin</b>"<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> or again: the act of an imperfect subject, <i>actus imperfecti</i>. <p>

Three great theses of peripatetic metaphysics are, as it were, the offspring of this distinction between potency and act: the relation of parentage can be traced in the theory of composition from matter and form; in the composition of universal and individual; and finally in the theory of the four causes, -- a theory which is the fruit of an analysis of motion.
