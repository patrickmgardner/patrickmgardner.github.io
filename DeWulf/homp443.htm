&sect; 8. PROTESTANT PHILOSOPHY AND MYSTICISM.<p>

<b>443. General Outhine.</b> -- The theological controversies of the Reformation were inevitably bound to influence philosophy. The leading principle of Protestant theology was private judgment in interpreting the Scriptures and determining dogma. Now, when each decides his own dogma, he can have little difficulty in harmonizing it with a philosophy chosen no less freely. This accounts for the varied and often contradictory forms of the philosophical systems of the earlier Protestants (Neo-Platonism, Stoicism, Aristotelianism, pantheistic mysticism). <p>

LUTHER (1483-1546) was not a philosopher. He preached an irreconcilable opposition between reason and faith, the former being a work of the flesh (<i>caro</i>), the latter of the spirit (<i>spiritus</i>).

The passivity of man under grace and his subjection to an absolute predestination, lead directly to determinism. Some of Luther's disciples, more anxious than their master to justify their religious beliefs before the bar of reason, sought in one way or another to harmonize philosophy with the reformed dogma. The leading philosophers of the new religion were Zwingli, Melanchthon and B&ouml;hme.
