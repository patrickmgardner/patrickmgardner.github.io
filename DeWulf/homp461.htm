The <i>Cursus</i> of John of St. Thomas was edited at Lyons in 1633; previously several editions of various parts had appeared. Re-edited in 1883 (Viv&egrave;s, 3 vols.). The works of A. de Sena were printed by Plantinus, 1569-1575. The <i>Cursus Conimbricensis</i> was printed as compiled at the end of the sixteenth century, and repeatedly in the early seventeenth. The <i>Disp. Met.</i> of Suarez, first edited in 1597 at Salamanca, has been many times reprinted: so too the <i>De Legibus</i>, which first appeared at Coimbra in 1612. Complete editions of Suarez, 23 folio vols., Venice, 1740; and Paris (Viv&egrave;s), 1856. The <i>Enarratio</i> of Toletus was reprinted in Rome, 1869.

The <i>Summa Philosophiae</i> of C. Alamannus was edited at Paris in 1638-1639 by the Canons Regular of St. Augustine, especially by John Fronteau, chancellor of Ste. Genevi&egrave;ve and of the University. Alamannus having left the Metaphysics unfinished and the Ethics uncommenced, Fronteau finished the one and wrote the other according to the plan of Alamannus. Re-edited in three volumes (with Fronteau's additions) by EHRLE (Paris). Cf. 387, n. 2, and 390. The <i>Quaestiones Philosophicae Lib. V.</i> of Maurus were printed in 1658 and 1670 (Rome), and again in 1875; his commentaries on Aristotle in 1668, and the portions dealing with ethics in 1696-1698. All his commentaries were re-edited by EHRLE (Paris, 1884) : <i>Aristotelis opera omnia quae extant brevi paraphrasi et litterae perpetuo inhaerente expositione illustrata a S. Mauro</i>, 4 vols. <p>
