<b>413. German Mysticism after Eckhart.</b> -- Eckhart formed a school in this sense that his successors were deeply influenced by the study of his writings. This is particularly noticeable in the BLESSED HENRY Suso (about 1300-1366), in TAULER (1290-1361), and in the author of the <i>German Theology</i>. While Eckhart was more brilliant than his successors, many of the latter succeeded better than he did in defining the relations between Creator and creature.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> But on the other hand, however, his mystical teaching was exploited and exaggerated by many popular sects in support of the growing practice of a pantheistic morality. In this way it contributed <i>indirectly</i> to that debasement of religion which culminated in the Reformation.<p>
