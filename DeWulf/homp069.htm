<b>69. Sceptical Schools; The Later Academies.</b> -- The Sceptics of the third and second centuries assign as the only aim of philosophy the search for happiness; and happiness for them, as for the Stoics and Epicureans, consists in the soul's rest, -- <i>ataraxy</i>. If they deny the possibility of certain knowledge, it is because in their view speculative certitude is not indispensable for happiness. <p>

Three Sceptic Schools appeared during this period: (1) The <i>Pyrrhic School</i> founded by PYRRHO OF ELIS (about 360-270), which, however, was of short duration and little influence. (2) The <i>Second or Middle Academy</i>, established by ARCESILAUS OF PITANE (315-240), who gave the ancient Platonic school an inclination towards scepticism and concluded like Pyrrho that, certitude being an illusion, <b>epoch&ecirc;</b> or the suspension of the exercise of the judicial faculty is the only legitimate attitude for the philosopher. (3) The <i>Third or New Academy</i>, founded a century later by CARNEADES OF CYRENE (213-129), who developed the scepticism of the Academy and amassed objections against Dogmatism in general and Stoicism in particular. Following Arcesilaus, Carneades endeavours to find in the probability of certain representations, a sufficient but indispensable motive of conduct.
