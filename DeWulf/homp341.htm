<b>341. Siger of Brabant: His Life and Works.</b> -- We are certain of only a few meagre details in the life of SIGER OF BRABANT.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Renowned he certainly was in his day -- "the professor of the rue de Fouarre" -- winning honourable mention from that strange pamphleteer, Pierre du Bois,<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> and flattering verses from Dante in his <i>Divina Comedia</i>;<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> dangerous too, in no less degree, for even the most illustrious of his contemporaries felt called upon to write in refutation of his teaching, and the ecclesiastical authorities to prohibit and condemn it. Master of Arts at Paris, he was for ten years a source of perpetual disturbance in the University. In 1266 he gave

trouble to the legate, Simon de Brie, in matters of discipline, which were in themselves only youthful excesses, but which also revealed Siger's proud and unruly spirit. From 1272 to 1275 he defied the rector of the University, Alberic of Reims, and gathered around him a party of supporters. Finally and especially, he was the recognized leader of the Averro&iuml;sts at Paris during the sixth and seventh decades of the thirteenth century; and the talent he displayed in defending his opinions attracted a considerable section of the arts students (<i>Scholares Golardiae</i><sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup>) to his lectures. Censured first in 1270, he still continued to propagate his views and to oppose the scholastic masters. A second condemnation in 1277 put an end to his teaching. Perhaps it was in connection with this condemnation that on the 23rd of October, 1277, Simon Duval, the Inquisitor for France, summoned Siger to his tribunal. It is very likely. Anyhow Siger left Paris about this time and appealed from the inquisitor's jurisdiction to that of the Roman Court. He died prior to 1300 (for, that year Dante encounters him in his journey through Paradise) and perhaps prior to November, 1284.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> The Brabantian continuator of the chronicle of Martin of Troppau<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> adds that he died by the sword, assassinated by his <i>clericus</i>. "Qui Sygerus, natione Brabantinus, eo quod opiniones contra fidem tenuerat Parisius subsistere non valens, Romanam curiam adiit; ibique post parvum tempus a clerico suo quasi dementi perfossus periit." This text, discovered by Baeumker,<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> throws a new light on the much disputed question of the end of Siger. <p>

His principal work is the <i>De Anima Intellectiva</i>. It directly inspired the <i>De Unitate Intellectus Contra Averro&iuml;stas</i> of St. Thomas.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Both treatises were composed between 1266 and 1277, in one of the periods of feverish controversy between scholastics and Averro&iuml;sts.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> Siger has also left a <i>Quaestio De Aeternitate Mundi</i>, two <i>Quaestiones Naturales</i> and three logical treatises -- the latter of minor importance towards the study of his Averro&iuml;stic teaching (the <i>Quaestiones Logicales</i>; a question <i>Utrum hec sit vera "Homo est animal, nullo existente"</i>; and a collection of six <i>Impossibilia</i>).  <p>
