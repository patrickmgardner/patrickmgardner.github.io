<b>382. Marsilius of lnghen and Peter D'AiIly.</b> -- These two philosophers were the leading Ockamists of the second half of the fourteenth century. MARSILIUS OF INGHEN (fl. 1396) won a high reputation at the University of Paris, where for many years he advocated the theories of William of Ockam.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> He had so many auditors when he was magister regens in the Faculty of Arts that special provision had to be made to secure sufficiently large halls for his lectures.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> He held the position of rector in 1367 and again in 1371, and took a leading part in all important University affairs, especially in those of the great Schism. The disturbed state of the University may have led to his departure from Paris (about 1379). He went to Heidelberg and became the leading spirit of the new University there. He was appointed its first rector in 1386. His chief work is the <i>Quaestiones supra IV. Lib. Sentent.</i>

PETER D'AILLY, surnamed the Eagle of France (<i>Aquila Franciae</i>), was born at Compi&egrave;gne in 1350, studied theology in the Navarre College at Paris (1372), was promoted to the doctorate in 1380, became successively chancellor of the University (1389), bishop of Puy and of Cambrai, and cardinal (1411). He died in 1425. His numerous works, which include <i>Commentaries on the Sentences</i> and a treatise <i>De Anima</i>, show him to have been a faithful disciple of William of Ockam. He was also deeply versed in mysticism (<b><a href="homp394.htm" target="xref">394</a></b>). <p>
