<b>435. Atomism.</b> -- A place of equal importance in Renaissance philosophy must be assigned to <i>Atomism</i>, as taught by Democritus and Epicurus. Thus, we find it in the writings of DANIEL SENNERT (1572-1637), of ERYCIUS PUTEANUS (1574-1646), the successor of Justus Lipsius at Louvain, and others. The most noted among the atomists of the age was PETER GASSENDI (1592-1655), author of <i>Exercitationes Paradoxicae adversus Aristotelicos</i> and <i>De Vita et Moribus Epicuri</i>. All these philosophers, especially the latter, waged an implacable war against Aristotelianism. They lent a willing hand to the scientists in throwing discredit on the antiquated Physics of the Stagirite and -- as an inevitable, though illogical consequence -- on the remainder of his philosophy as well (Ch. III., &sect; 7).<p>
