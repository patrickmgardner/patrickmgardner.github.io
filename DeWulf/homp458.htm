<b>458. The Jesuits In Italy.</b> -- The theological and philosophical movement promoted by the Jesuits, extended to the universities they founded outside of Spain and Portugal (Ingolstadt, for example). In Germany, GREGORY OF VALENCE, author of a commentary on the <i>Summa</i> (1591), and in Belgium, BELLARMINE and LESSIUS, made known the new tendencies. <p>

In Italy especially, important centres of study were organized, the principal being the <i>Collegium Romanum</i> founded by St. Ignatius. This college had as professors JACOB LEDESMA (fl. 1575) and F. TOLETUS (1559-1569), a pupil of Soto at Salamanca, author of excellent commentaries on Aristotle and of an <i>Enarratio in Summam Theol. S. Thomae</i>; also GABRIEL VASQUEZ (fl. 1604), the great rival of Suarez and author of valuable <i>Dis<!--
496 SCHOLASTICISM IN THE XV. AND XVI. CENTURIES 
--><A NAME="p496"></a>putationes Metaphysicae</i>, as also of a fine commentary on the <i>Summa Theologica</i> of St. Thomas. <p>

Under Vasquez and Suarez, from 1584 to 1588, studied COSMUS ALAMANNUS, born at Milan (1559), where he afterwards taught. From 1618 to 1623 he published a <i>Summa Philosophiae</i> in which he gave a didactic exposition of the philosophy of St. Thomas, grouping his subject-matter into various sections (logic, physics, ethics, metaphysics, see <b><a href="homp461.htm" target="xref">461</a></b>) and noting carefully all the texts of the master referring to each topic dealt with. <p>

PETER ARRUBAL, JOHN DE LUGO, ANTHONY PEREZ, NICHOLAS  MARTINEZ and SYLVESTER MAURUS deserve special mention among the seventeenth - century professors at the <i>Collegium Romanum</i>. MAURUS, born at Spoleto in 1619, began to teach in 1653 and continued teaching till his death in 1687. Besides numerous theological works, he wrote <i>Quaestionum Philosophicarum L. Quinque</i>, and also a paraphrase of all the works of Aristotle. This latter embodies the results of the great thirteenth-century commentaries and is a model of clearness and conciseness. Maurus worked on the Greek text and the best Latin versions available in his time.
