&sect; I. LATIN AVERROISM.<p>

<b>397. Averro&iuml;sm at Paris.</b> -- In spite of all the official condemnations and all the opposition offered by succeeding generations of doctors, Averro&iuml;sm steadily gained a growing number of supporters. Its leaders were men of ability and daring. Certain of Ockam's disciples went over to its standard: indeed they had to take but a small step to reach the theory of the two truths, and we can understand how they were not always able to keep out of an error on which Ockamism bordered so closely.
