<b>45. The Being that is Pure Act. Proofs of its Existence.</b> -- Above all changing things, which are mixtures of act and potency, there reigns supreme one immovable Being, which is Pure Actuality (<b>to ti en einai to pr&ocirc;ton</b>). <p>

The principal proof of the existence of God is based on the existence of change (<i>motus</i>). Movement, though eternal, is unintelligible without a Prime Mover, itself immovable. For, as nothing can pass, of itself, from potency to act (<b><a href="homp044.htm" target="xref">44</a></b>, 3), all movement or change necessarily supposes a mover; and unless we grant some one prime mover, itself entirely beyond and free from the influence of all change whatsoever, we are forced to admit -- for the explanation of actual change -- that there exists an infinite series of moving causes: which is absurd. Aristotle adds to this a second proof, based on the order, harmony and unity of the world, -- known afterwards in philosophy as the teleological proof.
