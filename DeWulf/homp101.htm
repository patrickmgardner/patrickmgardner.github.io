<b>101. Physics.</b> -- To explain <i>the constitution of corporeal substances</i>, St. Augustine admits the matter and form theory. Though in some places his idea of matter seems to be that of a chaotic mass brought forth from nothingness by an act of the Creator, still in several passages of his <i>Confessions</i> he refers to matter as to an undetermined something, incapable of existing without a form, -- in language that recalls the doctrine of Aristotle. Mindful of the matter and form starting-point he speaks of a <i>quasi materia</i> in referring to the angels. The relation of matter to the quantitative state of being is not referred to in St. Augustine's cosmology. <p>

God has deposited in matter a hidden treasure of active forces, constituted according to the exemplars which correspond, in the eternal knowledge, with material essences. These are the seminal principles or <i>rationes seminales</i> (cf <b><a href="homp062.htm" target="xref">62</a></b>, 3), whose successive germination, in the womb of matter, when circumstances are favourable, -- <i>acceptis opportunitatibus</i> (<i>De Gen. ad litt.</i>, vii., 28), -- produces the different species of corporeal beings. There is a distinct germ corresponding to each natural kind or species of body. <p>

St. Augustine frankly subscribes to an <i>esthetic and metaphysical optimism</i> regarding the world, and assigns as a reason for such optimism the perfection of the Divine thought, which must necessarily have conceived harmonious relations between the various created essences.
