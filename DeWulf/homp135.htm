<h3>Chapter II.</h3>
<h4>The Philosophy of the Ninth, Tenth and Eleventh  Centuries.</h4><p>

<b>135. R&eacute;sum&eacute;.</b> -- The first forward movement of scholastic thought may be detected in the study of the Universals (Art. I., &sect; 1). We can follow here, step by step, the gradual growth of inquiry, the discovery and cultivation of psychology, and the slow elaboration of a solution which was to be ratified by the researches of subsequent centuries. In the eleventh century St. Anselm (Art. I., &sect; 2) made the first attempt to systematize the results so far achieved. His synthesis, necessarily incomplete, was gradually enriched and perfected by the generations that followed him. <p>

In John Scotus Eriugena we see the father of the anti-scholastics. In his philosophy we find the germs of all the hostile tendencies which troubled scholasticism down to the close of the twelfth century (Art. II.). A separate article (Art. III.) will deal with theological controversies in their relations to philosophy.<p>
