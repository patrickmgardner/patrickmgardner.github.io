What a pity these latter did not pursue, beyond the domain of natural and social right, the investigations to which the Renaissance was inviting them! They would have been a match for the anti-scholastics of their time. But they failed to take account of, or adapt themselves to, the new lines of thought that were current in their age: this it was that paralyzed the influence of the Spanish movement.
