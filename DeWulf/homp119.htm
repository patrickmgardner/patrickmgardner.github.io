<b>119. Conclusion.</b> -- The definition we have chosen, though intrinsic and doctrinal, does not exclude all notions of a relative character. Moreover, to know a thing in its entirety, we must not only analyze the thing in itself; but examine its relations with other things. And therefore the historian, after having studied the philosophy itself of any epoch, and after having weighed and measured the significance of all the other manifestations of the intellectual life of the time, has a right to institute a third group of researches into the reciprocal influences of all these various departments of a civilization. Scholasticism is related not with theology and ancient philosophy alone, but with the scientific, artistic, political, economic and social life of the Middle Ages; for in the concrete reality of man's social life all human events and activities are interwoven and interconnected.
