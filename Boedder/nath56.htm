THE IDEA OF INDETERMINATE BEING. 463  
--><A NAME="p463"></a>
<h3>APPENDIX IV. St. Thomas and the Idea of Indeterminate Being.</h3><p>

A DISTINGUISHED student of Rosmini's philosophy called some years ago our attention to these words of St. Thomas: "Anima semper intelligit se et Deum indeterminate."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> He found in them a support of Rosmini's hypothesis that we are born with a dim perception of God <i>as being</i>. (Cf. p. 14.) Assuredly an interpretation like this would upset the whole of St. Thomas's psychology as contained in his commentaries on Aristotle's <i>De Anima</i>, and in <i>Sum. Theol</i>. I. qq. 75-89.<p>

But what does St. Thomas mean by those words? Considering the whole context in which they occur, and comparing it with the doctrine of Aquinas on the <i>Intellectus agens</i>, especially with the remarkable assertion, <i>"Intellectus agens est agens tantum et nulla modo patiens,"</i><sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> and with the more explicit teaching laid down in ii. <i>Sent.</i> dist. 17. q. 2. a. 1. &sect; <i>"Et ideo remotis omnibus praedictis erroribus,"</i> we have arrived at the following interpretation, which the reader may kindly consider and examine: In virtue of its spiritual nature and of the spontaneous activity of the <i>intellectus agens</i>

flowing from it, the soul possesses habitually all needful capacity for being awakened to self-consciousness and for ascending by degrees to the knowledge of its Creator. So far forth we may say, then, that the soul always knows its own existence and God <i>indeterminately</i>; that is to say, such is the natural sympathy between the organic faculty called imagination, and the spiritual faculty called <i>intellectus agens</i>, that immediately upon due determination of the imaginative faculty, the soul will arrive in the first place at the intellectual perception of material things; concomitantly, in the second place, at self-consciousness, inasmuch as it knows its own knowing; and finally, in virtue of its natural tendency to investigate the causes of things perceived, by degrees it will arrive at the knowledge of the First Cause, or God.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup>
