<h4>SECTION 5. -- <i>Proof of an Immediate Influence of God</i>.</h4><p>

Thesis XIII. -- <i>At least one substance distinct from God has been immediately produced by God Himself.</i><p>

84. From Thesis XI. it is evident that everything else save God is contingent. In other words, nothing exists with absolute necessity but God alone; everything which is not God exists only so far as He by His power originates its existence. But God cannot have originated the existence of things merely possible in themselves, unless <i>at least one</i> of all possible substances that ever came into existence was <i>immediately</i> produced by Him.<p>
