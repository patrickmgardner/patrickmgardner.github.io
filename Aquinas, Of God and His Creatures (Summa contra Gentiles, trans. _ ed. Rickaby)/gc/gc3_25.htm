<H1>That the End of every Subsistent Intelligence is to understand 
God</h1>

The proper act of everything is its end, as being its second 
perfection:<A HREF="gc3_25a.htm">*</a> hence what is well disposed to 
its own proper act is said to be virtuous and good.  But to understand 
is the proper act of a subsistent intelligence: that then is its end.  
And the most perfect instance of this act is its final end and 
perfection: this is particularly true of acts which are not directed to 
production, acts such as understanding and feeling.  But since such 
acts take their species from their objects, and are known through their 
objects, any given one of these acts will be the more perfect, the more 
perfect its object is.  Consequently, to understand the most perfect 
intelligible object, which is God, will be the most perfect instance of 
the activity of understanding.  To know God then by understanding is 
the final end of every subsistent intelligence.<p>

But one may say: 'It is true that the last end of a subsistent 
intelligence consists in understanding the best intelligible object, 
still the best intelligible object, absolutely speaking, is not the 
best object for <i>this</i> or <i>that</i> subsistent intelligence; but 
the higher any subsistent intelligence is, the higher is its best 
intelligible object; and therefore the highest subsistent intelligence 
created has for its best intelligible object that which is best 
absolutely; hence its happiness will be in understanding God; but the 
happiness of a lower subsistent intelligence will be to understand some 
lower intelligible object, which is at the same time the highest of the 
objects that can be understood by it.  And particularly it seems to be 
the lot of the human understanding, on account of its weakness, not to 
understand the absolutely best intelligible object: for in respect of 
the knowledge of that truth of which there is most to be known the 
human intellect is as the bat's eye to the sun.<p>

Nevertheless it may be manifestly shown that the end of every 
subsistent intelligence, even the lowest, is to understand God.  For 
(a) the final end of all beings, to which they tend, is God (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_18.htm">XVIII</a>.  But the human understanding, however it 
be lowest in the order of subsistent intelligences, is nevertheless 
superior to all beings devoid of understanding.  Since then the nobler 
substance has not the ignobler end, God Himself will be the end also of 
the human understanding.  But every intelligent being gains its last 
end by understanding it.  Therefore it is by understanding that the 
human intellect attains God as its end.<p>

(c). Everything most of all desires its own last end.  But the human 
mind is moved to more desire and love and delight over the knowledge of 
divine things, little as it can discern about them, than over the 
perfect knowledge that it has of the lowest things.<A 
HREF="gc3_25b.htm">*</a><p>

(e). All sciences and arts and practical faculties are attractive only 
for the sake of something else: for in them the end is not knowledge 
but production of a work.  But speculative sciences are attractive for 
their own sake, for their end is sheer knowledge.  Nor is there found 
any action in human life, with the exception of speculative study, 
which is not directed to some other and further end.  Even actions done 
in sport, which seem to be done in view of no end, have a due end, 
which is refreshment of mind, to enable us thereby to return stronger 
to serious occupations: otherwise we should play always, if play was 
sought for its own sake, which would be unbefitting.<A 
HREF="gc3_25c.htm">*</a> Therefore the practical arts are ordained to 
the speculative, and all human activity has intellectual speculation 
for its end.  In all due ordination of sciences and arts, the character 
of final end attaches to that science or art which issues precepts as 
master-builder to the rest: thus the art of navigation, to which 
belongs the management of a ship, lays down precepts for ship-building.  
In this relation Metaphysics (<i>philosophia prima</i>) stand to all 
speculative sciences.  On metaphysics they all depend, and from that 
science they receive their principles and directions how to proceed 
against deniers of principles.<A HREF="gc3_25d.htm">*</a>  This first 
philosophy is wholly directed to the final end of the knowledge of God: 
hence it is called a divine science.  The knowledge of God therefore is 
the final end of all human study and activity.<p>

(f). In all series of agents and causes of change the end of the prime 
agent and mover must be the ultimate end of all, as the end of a 
general is the end of all the soldiers who serve under him.  But among 
all the component parts of man we find the intellect to be the superior 
moving power: for the intellect moves the appetite, putting its object 
before it; and the intellectual appetite, or will, moves the sensible 
appetites, the irascible and concupiscible: hence we do not obey 
concupiscence except under the command of the will.<A 
HREF="gc3_25e.htm">*</a>  The sensitive appetite, crowned by the 
consent of the will, proceeds to move the body. The end therefore of 
the intellect is the end of all human actions.  But the end and good of 
the intellect is truth; and consequently its last end is the first 
truth.  The last end then of the whole man and of all his activities 
and desires is to know the first truth, which is God.<p>

(g). There is a natural desire in all men of knowing the causes of the 
things that they see.  It was through wonder at seeing things, the 
causes of which were unseen, that men first began to philosophise.  Nor 
does enquiry cease until we arrive at the first cause: then we 
consider our knowledge perfect, when we know the first cause.  Man 
then naturally desires so to know the first cause as his last end.<A 
HREF="gc3_25f.htm">*</a>  But the first cause is God; and the last end 
of man and of every subsistent intelligence, is called blessedness or 
happiness.  To know God then is the blessedness and happiness of every 
subsistent intelligence.<A HREF="gc3_25g.htm">*</a><p>

Hence it is said: <i>This is eternal life, that they know thee, the 
only true God</i> (John xvii, 3).<p>
