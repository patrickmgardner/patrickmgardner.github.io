It does not follow from this that human perfection 
is perfect self-realisation, in the sense of every
power being realised to the utmost. The powers of 
man are many, not all of equally high quality. The
utmost realisation of one might and would interfere
with the realisation of another: the baser might be
brought out to the loss of nobler and better: the
perfection of man is a harmony of powers, which
implies both use and restraint of them severally 
according to the excellence of their several functions.	
In man, much must be left in potentiality, if the
best actuality that he is capable of is to be realised.
In an orchestra, where every instrument played (or
brayed) continuously at its loudest, the result would
be din indescribable, a maximum of noise with a
minimum of music. Perfection is actuality up to 
standard. In a finite nature, the standard imposes 
limitations, according to the Aristotelian canon of the
golden mean, a canon not framed for the infinite.
