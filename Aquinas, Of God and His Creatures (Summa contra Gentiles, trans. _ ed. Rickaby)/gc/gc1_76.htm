<H1>That with one and the same Act of the Will
God wills Himself and all other Beings</h1>

EVERY power tends by one and the same activity to its object and to 
that which makes the said object an object to such a power, as with the 
same vision we see light and the colour which is made actually visible 
by light.  But when we wish a thing for an end, and for that alone, 
that which is desired for the end receives from the end its character 
of an object of volition. Since then God wills all things for Himself 
(Chap. <a href="gc1_74.htm">LXXIV</a>), with one act of will He wills 
Himself and other things.<p> 

2. What is perfectly known and desired, is known and desired to the 
whole extent of its motive power. But a final end is a motive not only 
inasmuch as it is desired in itself, but also inasmuch as other things 
are rendered desirable for its sake.  He therefore who perfectly 
desires an end, desires it in both these ways. But it is impossible to 
suppose any volitional act of God, by which He should will Himself, and 
not will Himself perfectly: since there is nothing imperfect in God. By 
every act therefore by which He wills Himself, He wills Himself and 
other things for His own sake absolutely; and other things besides 
Himself He does not will except inasmuch as He wills Himself.<p> 

3. As promises are to conclusions in things speculative, so is the end 
to the means in things practical and desirable: for as we know 
conclusions by premises, so from the end in view proceeds both the 
desire and the carrying out of the means.  If then one were to wish the 
end apart, and the means apart, by two separate acts, there would be a 
process from step to step in his volition (Chap. <a 
href="gc1_57.htm">LVII</a>). But this is impossible in God, who is 
beyond all movement.<p> 

7. To will belongs to God inasmuch as He has understanding. As then by 
one act He understands Himself and other beings, inasmuch as His 
essence is the pattern of them all, so by one act He wills Himself and 
all other beings, inasmuch as His goodness is the type of all 
goodness.
