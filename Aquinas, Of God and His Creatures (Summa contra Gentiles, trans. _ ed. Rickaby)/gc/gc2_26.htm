<H1>That the Divine Understanding is not limited to certain fixed 
Effects</h1> 

NOW that it has been shown (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_23.htm">XXIII</a>) that 
the divine power does not act of physical necessity, but by 
understanding and will, lest any one should think that God's 
understanding or knowledge extend only to certain fixed effects, and 
that thus God acts under stress of ignorance, though not under stress 
of physical constraint, it remains to show that His  knowledge or 
understanding is bounded by no limits in its view of effects.<p>  

2. We have shown above (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_43.htm">XLIII</a>) the 
infinity of the divine essence. Now the plane of the infinite can never 
be reached by any piling up of finite quantities, because the infinite 
infinitely transcends any finite quantities however many, even though 
they were infinite in number.<A HREF="gc2_26a.htm">*</a> But no other 
being than God is infinite in essence: all others are essentially 
included under limited genera and species.<A HREF="gc2_26b.htm">*</a> 
Howsoever then and to whatsoever extent the effects of divine 
production are comprehended, it is ever within the compass of the 
divine essence to reach beyond them and to be the foundation of more. 
The divine understanding then, in perfectly knowing the divine essence 
(B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_47.htm">XLVII</a>), transcends any infinity 
of actual effects of divine power and therefore is not necessarily 
limited to these or those effects.<p>  

4. If the causality of the divine understanding were limited, as a 
necessary agent, to any effects, it would be to those effects which God 
actually brings into being. But it has been shown above (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_66.htm">LXVI</a>) that God understands even things that 
neither are nor shall be nor have been.<p> 

5. The divine knowledge stands to the things produced by God as the 
knowledge of an artist to the knowledge of his art. But every art 
extends to all that can possibly be contained under the kind of things 
subject to that art, as the art of building to all houses. But the kind 
of thing subject to the divine art is 'being' (<i>genus subjectum 
divinae artis est ens</i>), since God by His understanding is the 
universal principal of being (Chapp. <A HREF="gc2_21.htm">XXI</a>, <A 
HREF="gc2_24.htm">XXIV</a>). Therefore the divine understanding extends 
its causality to all things that are not inconsistent with the notion 
of 'being,' and is not limited to certain fixed effects  Hence it is 
said: <i>Great is our Lord, and great his power, and of his wisdom; 
there is no reckoning by number</i> (Ps. cxlvi, 5)  Hereby is excluded 
the position of some philosophers who said that from God's 
understanding of Himself there emanates a certain arrangement of things 
in the universe, as though He did not deal with creatures at His 
discretion fixing the limits of each creature and arranging the whole 
universe, as the Catholic faith professes. It is to be observed however 
that, though the divine understanding is not limited to certain 
effects, God nevertheless has determined to Himself fixed effects to be 
produced in due order by His wisdom, as it is said: <i>Thou hast 
disposed all things in measure, number and weight</i> (Wisd. xi, 
21).<A HREF="gc2_26c.htm">*</a><p>
