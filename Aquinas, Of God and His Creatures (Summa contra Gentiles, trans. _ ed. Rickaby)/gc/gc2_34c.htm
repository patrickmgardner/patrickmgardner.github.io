A professor of physical science, as such, does not arrive at the 
Creator. Motions, molar and molecular, -- vibrations and transferences 
chemical, biological, mechanical or cosmic -- are his subject-matter; 
but the Creator and the creative act are above motion. Atheist or 
theist, agnostic or Christian, a man may be equally proficient in 
physical science, as also he may be in cookery, engine-driving, or 
soap-boiling. Is this, the range of physical science is narrower and 
lower than that of literature. There is religious literature and divine 
poetry. When a physicist pronounces on a religious question, either for 
or against religion, he is <i>sutor supra crepidam:</i> he has overshot 
his subject. Of course he ought to overshoot his subject. A man should 
no more be a physicist and nothing else than he should be a 
tallow-chandler and nothing else. The misery is, when, not having been 
conversant with God in his laboratory, observatory, or dissecting. 
room, the physicist poses upon this non-experience to turn 
antitheologian. One might as well pose upon the limitations of the 
tallow vat. God is not evident in the melting of tallow, nor in the 
scientific infliction and curing of wounds. This 
<i>liparo-physico-antitheological</i> humour, as Aristophanes might 
have called it, is an exudation of the narrowest bigotry. Wherever 
physical science becomes the staple of education, to the setting aside 
of Latin and Greek, it will be found necessary in the interests of 
religion to insist upon a parallel course of metaphysics, psychology, 
and ethics. A popular course is all that will be possible or necessary. 
Otherwise, trained on physical science without literature or 
philosophy, the mind suffers atrophy of the religious faculties, a 
disease which some seem anxious to induce upon mankind, -- a painful 
disease nevertheless, productive of much restlessness and irritability, 
as the life of Thomas Huxley shows. To repeat St Thomas's words here: 
-- "It is not the concern of physical science to study the first origin 
of all things: that study belongs to the metaphysician who deals with 
being in general and realities apart from motion." All the more 
important is it for the physicist to imbibe some tincture of 
metaphysics, that he may not "wallow in a slough of barbarism' (Plato, 
Rep. vii, 5330). This note is suggested by Sir Oliver Lodge's article, 
<i>Faith and Science</i>, in the <i>Hibbert Journal</i> for October, 
1902, a masterly exposition of the present conflict between the two, 
except for one mistake. Sir Oliver confounds the <i>mysterious</i> with 
the <i>miraculous</i>. The daily bread of the Christian is mystery, not 
miracle. Miracle is obvious to the senses; mystery lies beyond sense.
