<h1>That the Souls of the Saints after Death have their Will immutably 
fixed on Good</h1>

SO long as a soul can change from good to evil, or from evil to good, 
it is in a state of combat and warfare: it has to be careful in 
resisting evil, not to be overcome by it, or in endeavouring to set 
itself free from it. But so soon as the soul is separated from the 
body, it will be no longer in the state of warfare or combat, but of 
receiving reward or punishment, according as it has lawfully fought or 
unlawfully.<A HREF="gc4_92a.htm">*</a><p> 

3. Naturally the rational creature desires to be happy: hence it cannot 
will not to be happy: still its will may turn aside from that in which 
true happiness consists, or, in other words, it may have a perverse 
will: this comes of the object of true happiness not being apprehended 
as such, but some other object in its stead,<A HREF="gc4_92b.htm">*</a> 
and to this the will inordinately turns, and makes a last end of it: 
thus he who makes bodily pleasures the end of his existence, counts 
them best of good things, which is the idea of happiness. But they who 
are already blessed in heaven apprehend the object of true happiness as 
making their happiness and last end: otherwise their desire would not 
be set at rest in that object, and they would not be blessed and happy. 
The will of the blessed therefore cannot swerve from the object of true 
happiness. <p> 

4. Whoever has enough in what he has, seeks nothing else beyond. But 
whoever is finally blessed has enough in the object of true happiness, 
and therefore seeks nothing that is not in keeping with that object. 
Now the only way in which the will can be perverse is by willing 
something inconsistent with the object of true happiness.<p> 

5. Sin never befalls the will without some ignorance in the 
understanding [cf. B. III, Chap. <A HREF="gc3_10.htm">X</a>]: hence it 
is said, <i>They are mistaken who do evil</i> (Prov. xiv, 22); and the 
Philosopher says that every evil man is ignorant.<A 
HREF="gc4_92c.htm">*</a> But the soul that is truly blessed can in no 
way be ignorant, since in God it sees all things that appertain to its 
perfect well-being. In no way then can it have an evil will, especially 
since that vision of God is always actual.<p> 

6. Our soul can err about conclusions before it is brought back to 
first principles. When the knowledge of conclusions is carried back to 
first principles, we have scientific knowledge which cannot be false.<A 
HREF="gc4_92d.htm">*</a> Now as the principle of demonstration is in 
abstract sciences, so is the scope, end and aim, in matters of desire. 
So long then as our will does not attain its final end, it may be 
perverted, but not after it has arrived at the enjoyment of its final 
end, which is desirable for its own sake, as the principles of 
demonstration are self-evident.<A HREF="gc4_92e.htm">*</a>.
