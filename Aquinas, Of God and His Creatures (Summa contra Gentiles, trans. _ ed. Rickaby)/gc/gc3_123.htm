<H1>That Marriage ought to be Indissoluble</h1>

LOOKING at the matter rightly, one must see that the aforesaid reasons 
not only argue a long duration for that natural human partnership of 
male and female, which we call marriage, but further imply that the 
partnership ought to be lifelong.<p> 

1. Property is a means to the preservation of human life. And because 
natural life cannot be preserved in one and the same person of the 
father living on for all time, nature arranges for its preservation by 
the son succeeding his father in likeness of species: wherefore it is 
appropriate that the son should succeed his father in his property. It 
is natural therefore that the father's interest in his son should 
continue to the end of his life, and that father and mother should 
dwell together to the end.<A HREF="gc3_123a.htm">*</a><p> 

2. Woman is taken into partnership with man for the need of 
childbearing: therefore when the fertility and beauty of woman ceases, 
there is a bar against her being taken up by another man. If then a 
man, taking a woman to wife in the time of her youth, when beauty and 
fertility wait upon her, could send her away when she was advanced in 
years, he would do the woman harm, contrary to natural equity.<p> 

3. It is manifestly absurd for the woman to be able to send away the 
man, seeing that woman is naturally subject to the rule of man, and it 
is not in the power of a subject to run away from control. It being 
then against the order of nature for the woman to be allowed to desert 
the man, if the man were allowed to desert the woman, the partnership 
of man and woman would not be on fair terms, but would be a sort of 
slavery on the woman's side.<p> 

4. Men show a natural anxiety to be sure of their own offspring; and 
whatever stands in the way of that assurance runs counter to the 
natural instinct of the race. But if the man could send away the 
woman, or the woman the man, and form a connexion with another, 
certainty as to parentage would be difficult, when a woman had 
intercourse first with one man and then with another.<p> 

5. The greater the love, the more need for it to be firm and lasting. 
But the love of man and woman is counted strongest of all; seeing that 
they are united, not only in the union of the sexes, which even among 
beasts makes a sweet partnership, but also for the sharing in common of 
all domestic life, as a sign whereof a man leaves even father and 
mother for the sake of his wife (Gen. ii, 24). It is  fitting therefore 
for marriage to be quite indissoluble.<p> 

6. Of natural acts, generation alone is directed to the good of (the 
specific) nature: for eating and the separation from the body of other 
excretions concern the individual, but generation has to do with the 
preservation of the species. Hence, as law is instituted for the common 
good, the function of procreation ought to be regulated by laws divine 
and human. Now the laws laid down ought to proceed on the basis of the 
dictate of nature (<i>ex naturali instinctu</i>), if they are human 
laws, as in the exact sciences every human discovery takes its origin 
from principles naturally known: but if they are divine laws, they not 
only develop the dictate of nature, but also make up the deficiency of 
what nature dictates, as dogmas divinely revealed surpass the capacity 
of natural reason. Since then there is in the human species a natural 
exigency for the union of male and female to be one and indivisible, 
such unity and indissolubility must needs be ordained by human law. To 
that ordinance the divine law adds a supernatural reason, derived from 
the significancy of marriage as a type of the inseparable union of 
Christ with His Church, which is one as He is one.<A 
HREF="gc3_123b.htm">*</a> Thus then irregularities in the act of 
generation are not only contrary to the dictate of nature, but are also 
transgressions of laws divine and human:<A HREF="gc3_123c.htm">*</a> 
hence on this account any irregular behaviour in this matter is even a 
greater sin than in the matter of taking food or the like. But since 
all other factors in human life should be subordinate to that which is 
the best thing in man, it follows that the union of male and female 
must be regulated by law, not from the mere point of view of 
procreation, as in other animals, but also with an eye to good manners, 
or manners conformable to right reason, as well for man as an 
individual, as also for man as a member of a household or family, or 
again as a member of civil society. Thus understood, good manners 
involve the indissolubility of the union of male and female: for they 
will love one another with greater fidelity, when they know that they 
are indissolubly united: each partner will take greater care of the 
things of the house, reflecting that they are to remain permanently in 
possession of the same things: occasions of quarrels are removed, that 
might otherwise arise between the husband and the wife's relations, if 
the husband were to divorce his wife; and thus affinity becomes a 
firmer bond of amity: also occasions of adultery are cut off, occasions 
which would readily offer themselves, if husband could divorce his 
wife, or wife her husband.<A HREF="gc3_123d.htm">*</a><p> 

Hence it is said: <i>But I say to you that whoever putteth away his 
wife, except for fornication, and marrieth another, committeth adultery; 
and he that marrieth her that is put away, committeth adultery</i> 
(Matt. xix, 9): <i>But to them that are united in marriage, it is not I 
that give commandment, but the Lord, that the wife depart not from her 
husband</i> (1 Cor. vii, 10).<p> 

Divorce was reckoned an impropriety also among the ancient Romans, of 
whom Valerius Maximus (<i>De memor. dictis</i>, II, 1) relates that 
they believed that the marriage tie ought not to be broken off even for 
barrenness.<A HREF="gc3_123e.htm">*</a><p> 

Hereby the custom is banned of putting away wives, which however in 
the Old Law was permitted to the Jews for their hardness of heart, 
because they were prone to the killing of their wives: so the less evil 
was permitted to keep out the greater.
