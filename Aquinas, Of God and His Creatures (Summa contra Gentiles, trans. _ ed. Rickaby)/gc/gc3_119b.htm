I conceive that the insertion, <i>et cujus voluntas
est immutabilis</i>, should stand after <i>et affectum mentis</i>,
not before. If God does not accept the heart's affection 
for its own sake, what does he accept for its
own sake that man can give? Moreover a special
title of God is that of 'searcher of hearts'.
