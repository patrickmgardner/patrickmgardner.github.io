A body, according to St Thomas, is made up
of a potential subject, called 'matter,' connaturally
extended in space; and further of an actuating principle 
of energy, called 'substantial form,' which is so
united to the potential subject, or 'matter,' that the
latter thereby becomes an individual body within a
definite species, deriving its power of action from the
'substantial form,' or principle of energy.
