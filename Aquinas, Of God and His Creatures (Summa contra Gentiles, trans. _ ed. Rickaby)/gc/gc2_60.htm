<H1>That Man is not a Member the Human Species by possession of Passive 
Intellect, but by possession of Potential Intellect</h1>

AVERROES endeavours to meet these arguments and to maintain the 
position aforesaid. He says accordingly that man differs from dumb 
animals by what Aristotle calls the 'passive intellect,' which is that 
'cogitative power' (<i>vis cogitativa</i>) proper to man, in place 
whereof other animals have a certain 'estimative power' 
(<i>aestimativa</i>).<A HREF="gc2_60a.htm">*</a> The function of this 
'cogitative power' is to distinguish individual ideas and compare them 
with one another, as the intellect, which is separate and unmixed, 
compares and distinguishes between universal ideas.  And because by 
this cogitative power, along with imagination and memory, phantasms, or 
impressions of phantasy, are prepared to receive the action of the 
'active intellect,' whereby they are made actual terms of 
understanding, therefore the aforesaid cogitative power is called by 
the names of 'intellect' and 'reason.'<A HREF="gc2_60b.htm">*</a> 
Doctors say that it has its seat in the middle cell of the brain. 
According to the disposition of this power one man differs from another 
in genius, and in other points of intelligence; <i>and by the use and 
exercise of this power man acquires the habit of knowledge. Hence the 
passive intellect is the subject of the various habits of 
knowledge.</i> And this passive intellect is in a child from the 
beginning; <i>and by virtue of it he is a member of the human species 
before he actually understands anything.</i> So far Averroes. The 
falsity and perverseness of his statements evidently appears.<A 
HREF="gc2_60c.htm">*</a><p> 

1. Vital activities stand to the soul as second actualities to the 
first.<A HREF="gc2_60d.htm">*</a> Now the first actuality is prior in 
time to the second in the same subject, as knowledge is prior in time 
to learned speculation. In whatever being therefore there is found any 
vital activity, there must be some portion of soul standing to that 
activity as the first actuality to the second. But man has one activity 
proper to him above all other animals, namely that of understanding and 
reasoning. Therefore we must posit in man some proper specific 
principle, which shall be to the act of understanding as the first 
actuality to the second. This principle cannot be the aforesaid 
'passive intellect': for the principle of the aforesaid activity must 
be "impassible and nowise implicated with the body," as the Philosopher 
proves,<A HREF="gc2_60e.htm">*</a> whereas evidently quite the contrary 
is the case with the passive intellect. Therefore that cognitive 
faculty called the 'passive intellect' cannot possibly be the 
speciality that differentiates the human species from other animals.<p> 

2. An incident of the sensitive part cannot constitute a being in a 
higher kind of life than that of the sensitive part, as an incident of 
the vegetative soul does not place a being in a higher kind of life 
than the vegetative life. But it is certain that phantasy and the 
faculties consequent thereon, as memory and the like, are incidents of 
the sensitive part.<A HREF="gc2_60f.htm">*</a> Therefore by the 
aforesaid faculties, or by any one of them, an animal cannot be placed 
in any higher rank of life than that which goes with the sentient soul. 
But man is in a higher rank of life than that. Therefore the man does 
not live the life that is proper to him by virtue of the aforesaid 
'cogitative faculty,' or 'passive intellect.'<p> 

4. The 'potential intellect' is proved not to be the actualisation of 
any corporeal organ<A HREF="gc2_60g.htm">*</a> from this consideration, 
that the said intellect takes cognisance of all sensible forms under a 
universal aspect.  Therefore no faculty, the activity of which can 
reach to the universal aspects of all corporeal forms, can be the 
actualisation of any corporeal organ. But such a faculty is the will: 
for of all of the things that we understand we can have a will, at 
least of knowing them.<A HREF="gc2_60h.htm">*</a> And we also find acts 
of the will in the general: thus, as Aristotle says (Rhet. II, 4), we 
hate in general the whole race of robbers. The will then cannot be the 
actualisation of any bodily organ. But every portion of the soul is the 
actualisation of some bodily organ, except only the intellect properly 
so called. The will therefore belongs to the intellectual part, as 
Aristotle says.<A HREF="gc2_60i.htm">*</a> Now the will of man is not 
extrinsic to man, planted as it were in some separately subsisting 
intelligence, but is in the man himself: otherwise he would not be 
master of his own acts, but would be worked by the will of a spirit 
other than himself: those appetitive, or conative, faculties alone 
would remain in him, the activity whereof is conjoined with passion, to 
wit the irascible and concupiscible<A HREF="gc2_60j.htm">*</a> in the 
sentient part of his being, as in other animals, which are rather acted 
upon than act. But this is impossible: it would be the undoing of all 
moral philosophy and all social and political science.<A 
HREF="gc2_60k.htm">*</a> Therefore there must be in us a potential 
intellect to differentiate us from dumb animals: the passive intellect 
is not enough.<p> 

6. A habit and the act proper to that habit both reside in the same 
faculty. But to view a thing intellectually, which is the act proper to 
the habit of knowledge, cannot be an exercise of the faculty called 
'passive intellect,' but must properly belong to the potential 
intellect: for the condition of any faculty exercising intelligence is 
that it should not be an actualisation of any corporeal organ. 
Therefore the habit of knowledge is not in the passive intellect, but 
in the potential intellect.<p> 

8. Habitual understanding, as our opponent acknowledges, is an effect 
of the 'active intellect.' But the effects of the active intellect are 
actual representations in understanding, the proper recipient of which 
is the potential intellect, to which the active intellect stands 
related, as Aristotle says, "as art to material."<A 
HREF="gc2_60l.htm">*</a> Therefore the habitual understanding, which is 
the habit of knowledge, must be in the potential intellect, not in the 
passive.<p>
