<H1>That no Created Intelligence in seeing God sees
all things that can be seen in Him</h1>

THEN only does the knowledge of a principle necessitate the knowledge 
of all its effects, when the principle is thoroughly comprehended by the 
understanding: for so a principle is known to the whole extent of its 
power, all its effects being known as caused by it. But through the 
divine essence other things are known as effects from their cause. 
Since then created intelligence cannot know the divine substance so as 
to comprehend it, there is no necessity for it in seeing the divine 
substance to see all things that can be known thereby.<p> 

3. The extent of any power is measured by the objects to which it 
reaches. To know then all the objects to which any power reaches is to 
comprehend the power itself. But the divine power, being infinite, can 
be comprehended by no created intelligence, as neither can the divine 
essence (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_55.htm">LV</a>). Neither then can any 
created intelligence know all the objects to which the divine power 
extends.<p> 

5. No cognitive faculty knows anything except under the aspect of its 
proper object: thus by sight we know things only as coloured. Now the 
proper object of intelligence is whatever is in the substance of a 
thing.<A HREF="gc3_56a.htm">*</a> Therefore whatever the intelligence 
knows of a thing, it knows by a knowledge of the substance of the 
thing. If ever we know the substance of a thing by its accidents, that 
happens accidentally, inasmuch as our intellectual knowledge arises 
from sense, and thus we need to arrive at an intellectual view of 
substance through a knowledge of accidents: wherefore this does not 
take place in mathematics, but in the natural sciences only. Whatever 
therefore in a thing cannot be known by a knowledge of its substance, 
must remain unknown to the knowing mind. But what a voluntary agent 
wishes cannot be known by a knowledge of his substance: for the will 
does not tend to its objects altogether by natural necessity: hence 
'will' and 'nature' are counted two distinct active principles.<A 
HREF="gc3_56b.htm">*</a> What therefore a voluntary agent wills is not 
knowable except haply through certain effects, as, when we see one 
acting voluntarily, we know what he has willed: or it may be known in 
its cause, as God knows our wills, as He knows other effects of His 
production, by the fact of His being to us the cause of willing (B. I, 
Chap. <A HREF="gc1_68.htm">LXVIII</a> <i>ad fin</i>.): or it may be 
known by one intimating his will to another, as when one expresses his 
desire by speech. Since then many things depend on the absolute will of 
God, as has been partly shown already, and will hereafter appear, a 
created intelligence, even though seeing the substance of God, does not 
for all that see all that God sees by his substance.<A 
HREF="gc3_56c.htm">*</a><p> 

It may be objected that God's substance is something greater than all 
that He can make, or understand, or will beyond Himself; and that 
therefore, if a created intelligence can see the substance of God, much 
more can it know all that God through Himself either understands or 
wills or can do. But on careful study we see that it is not one and the 
same thing for an object to be known in itself and known in its cause. 
There are things easy enough to know in themselves, but not easily 
known in their causes. Though it is true that it is a grander thing to 
have understanding of the divine substance than to understand anything 
else, knowable in itself, away from that substance, still it is more 
perfect knowledge to know the divine substance, and in it to see its 
effects, than to know the divine substance without seeing its effects. 
Now the seeing of the divine substance may be without comprehension of 
it: but to have all things rendered intelligible through that 
substance and actually known, that cannot come about without 
comprehension.
