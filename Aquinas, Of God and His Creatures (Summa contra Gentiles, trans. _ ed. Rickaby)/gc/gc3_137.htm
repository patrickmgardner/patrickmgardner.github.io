<H1>Arguments against Perpetual Continence, with Replies</h1>
 
ARG. 1. The good of the species is more godlike than the good of
the individual. He then who abstains altogether from the act whereby
the species is perpetuated, sins more than he would by abstaining
from the act whereby the individual is preserved, namely, eating and 
drinking.<p>

<i>Reply</i>. Things that belong to the necessity of the individual 
stand on a different footing from things that belong to the necessity of 
the community. In the necessities of the individual, individual 
provision must be made: everyone must make use of meat and drink. But 
in the necessities of the community it is neither needful nor possible 
for the office of meeting such needs to be assigned to every individual. 
Many things are necessary to a multitude of men, which no one individual 
can attend to: therefore there must be different offices for different 
persons, as in the body the several members have their several 
functions. Since then procreation is not a necessity of the individual, 
but a necessity of the species, there is no need for all men to be 
procreants; but some men may abstain, and devote themselves to other 
offices, as to the life of a soldier or a contemplative.<p> 

<i>Arg. 2</i>. By divine ordinance there are given to man members apt 
for procreation, and a force of appetite inciting him thereto: whoever 
then altogether abstains from procreation seems to resist the ordinance 
of God.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. Divine providence gives to man endowments necessary for 
the species as a whole: still there is no call upon every individual 
man to make use of every one of these endowments. Thus man has a 
building capacity and a fighting capacity: yet all men need not be 
builders or soldiers; neither need every one apply himself to 
procreation.<A HREF="gc3_137a.htm">*</a><p> 

<i>Arg. 3</i>. If it is good for one man to lead a life of continence, 
it is better for many so to do, and the best thing of all would be for 
all to do it: so the human race would become extinct.<A 
HREF="gc3_137b.htm">*</a> <p>
 
<i>Reply</i>. From things necessary to the community, though it be 
better for individuals to abstain, when one is given to better things, 
still it is not good for all to abstain. This is apparent in the order 
of the universe. Though a pure spirit is better than a bodily substance, 
still that would not be a better but a more imperfect universe, in which 
there were pure spirits alone. Though the eye is better than the foot, 
it would not be a perfect animal that had not both eye and foot. So 
neither would the state of the commonwealth of man kind be perfect, 
unless there were some applied to acts of procreation, and others 
abstaining from such acts and given to contemplation.<p> 

<i>Arg. 4</i>. Chastity, like other virtues, lies in the mean. Therefore 
he acts against virtue, who altogether abstains from the gratification 
of his appetites.<A HREF="gc3_137c.htm">*</a><p> 

<i>Reply</i>. This objection has been already solved in treating of 
poverty (Chapp. <A HREF="gc3_132.htm">CXXXII, CXXXV</a>, Arg. 6). 
Irrational abstinence from all [lawful] sexual pleasures is called the 
vice of insensibility: but a rational abstinence [from all even lawful 
forms of such gratification] is a virtue exceeding the common measure of 
man, for it puts man in some sort of participation of the likeness of 
God. Hence virginity is said to be allied to angels.<A 
HREF="gc3_137d.htm">*</a><p> 

But though we say in general that it is better for one individual to 
observe continence than to use marriage, it may very well be that for 
some other individual the second course is the better. Hence the Lord 
says: <i>Not all men take this word: whoever can take, let him take</i>
(Matt. xix, 11, 12).
