St Thomas may have seen Greek MSS. of Aristotle in Italy, or at Paris, 
but I doubt if he could read them for himself. He is dependent on Latin 
translations, often bad ones. See an example in my <i>Aquinas 
Ethicus</i>, I, p. 111. In his <i>Opusculum de Unitate Intellectus</i>, 
he mentions his having seen a thirteenth and fourteenth book of 
Aristotle's <i>Metaphysics</i>, but declines further reference to them 
as being "not yet translated into our tongue." St Thomas and the 
mediaeval architects had genius, the fruits of which we still admire: 
but they had not at hand the manifold <i>adminicula</i> of the modern 
builder and the modern scholar. Nor was Averroes and the Arabian school 
any better off for Greek than St Thomas (Renan, p. 48).<p>

To this particular explanation of Aristotle however the Commentator 
would have been at no loss for a reply. The Greek referred to is <i>De 
anima</i>, II, i, 6, 8.  Aristotle adds (n. 12), after saying that some 
parts of the soul are not separable from the body: "There is nothing to 
prevent some parts of the soul being separable from the body, because 
they are actualisations of nothing corporeal." A conclusion seems to 
follow, the very opposite of that which St Thomas draws, and exactly 
what Averroes wishes, namely, that the intellectual part of the soul is 
not the actualisation, or form, of anything corporeal, but dwells apart 
from all body. In the above quoted <i>Opusculum, 'De unitate 
intellectus contra Averroistas</i>, which I take to be a later 
production, St Thomas recognises the force of this reply, and 
re-adjusts his position thus: "The intellect is a faculty of the soul, 
and the soul is the form of the body: but the power that is called 
intellect is not the actualisation of any bodily organ, because the 
activity of the body has nothing in common with the activity of 
intellect."  <i>Intellectus est potentia animae, quae est corporis 
forma, licet ipsa potentia, quae est intellectus, non est alicujus 
organi actus, quia nihil ipsius operationi communicat corporis operatio</i>
(<i>De unitate intellectus</i>, cap. iii).  So also Chap. LXVIII, last 
paragraph, and in Chap. <A HREF="gc2_56.htm">LXIX</a> (already translated) 
the replies nn. 3, 4, p. 117.<p>

ln this later explanation St Thomas has the support of Averroes, who 
says (<i>De anima</i>, III, p. 149): "But it has not been shown whether 
the body is perfected (or actualised) in the same way by all the powers 
of the soul; or whether there be some one of those powers whereby the 
body is not perfected (actualised, or informed)." I am persuaded that 
the retention of the paragraph as it stands in the text was due to an 
oversight on the part of the author. See note on p. 99 [i.e., <A 
HREF="gc2_32e.htm">note e</a> in <A HREF="gc2_32.htm">Chapter 
XXXII</a>].<p>
