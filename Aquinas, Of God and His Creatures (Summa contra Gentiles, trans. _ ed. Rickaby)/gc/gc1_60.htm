<H1>That God is Truth</h1>

TRUTH is a perfection of the understanding and of its act.  But 
the understanding of God is His substance; and the very act of 
understanding, as it is the being of God, is perfect as the being 
of God is perfect, not by any superadded perfection, but by 
itself. It remains therefore that the divine substance is truth 
itself.<P>

4. Though truth is properly not in things but in the mind, 
nevertheless a thing is sometimes called true, inasmuch as it 
properly attains the actuality of its proper nature. Hence 
Avicenna says that the truth of a thing is a property of the 
fixed and appointed being of each thing, inasmuch as such a thing 
is naturally apt to create a true impression of itself, and 
inasmuch as it expresses the proper idea of itself in the divine 
mind.<A HREF="gc1_60a.htm">*</a>  But God is His own essence: 
therefore, whether we speak of truth of the intellect or truth 
of the object, God is His own truth.<P>

     This is also confirmed by the authority of our Lord saying 
of Himself: <i>I am the way and the truth and the life</i> (John 
xiv, 6).<P>
