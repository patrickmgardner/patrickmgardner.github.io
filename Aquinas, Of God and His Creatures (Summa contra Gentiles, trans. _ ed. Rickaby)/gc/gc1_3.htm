<H1>That the Truths which we confess concerning God 
fall under two Modes or Categories</h1>

BECAUSE not every truth admits of the same mode of manifestation, and 
"a well-educated man will expect exactness in every class of subject, 
according as the nature of the thing admits," as is very well remarked 
by the Philosopher (<i>Eth. Nicom.</i> I, 1094b), we must first show 
what mode of proof is possible for the truth that we have now before 
us.  The truths that we confess concerning God fall under two modes. 
Some things true of God are beyond all the competence of human reason, 
as that God is Three and One. Other things there are to which even 
human reason can attain, as the existence and unity of God, which 
philosophers have proved to a demonstration under the guidance of the 
light of natural reason. That there are points of absolute 
intelligibility in God altogether beyond the compass of human reason, 
most manifestly appears. For since the leading principle of all 
knowledge of any given subject-matter is an understanding of the 
thing's innermost being, or substance -- according to the doctrine of 
the Philosopher, that the essence is the principle of demonstration -- 
it follows that the mode of our knowledge of the substance must be the 
mode of knowledge of whatever we know about the substance. Hence if the 
human understanding comprehends the substance of anything, as of a 
stone or triangle, none of the points of intelligibility about that 
thing will exceed the capacity of human reason.<A HREF="gc1_3a.htm">*</a> 
But this is not our case with regard to God. The human understanding 
cannot go so far of its natural power as to grasp His substance, since 
under the conditions of the present life the knowledge of our 
understanding commences with sense; and therefore objects beyond sense 
cannot be grasped by human understanding except so far as knowledge is 
gathered of them through the senses. But things of sense cannot lead 
our understanding to read in them the essence of the Divine Substance, 
inasmuch as they are effects inadequate to the power that caused them. 
Nevertheless our understanding is thereby led to some knowledge of God, 
namely, of His existence and of other attributes that must necessarily 
be attributed to the First Cause. There are, therefore, some points of 
intelligibility in God, accessible to human reason, and other points 
that altogether transcend the power of human reason.<A HREF="gc1_3b.htm">*</a>
<P> 

The same thing may be understood from consideration of degrees of 
intelligibility.<A HREF="gc1_3c.htm">*</a> Of two minds, one of which 
has a keener insight into truth than the other, the higher mind 
understands much that the other cannot grasp at all, as is clear in the 
'plain man' (<i>in rustico</i>), who can in no way grasp the subtle 
theories of philosophy.  Now the intellect of an angel excels that of a 
man more than the intellect of the ablest philosopher excels that of 
the plainest of plain men (<i>rudissimi idiotae</i>).  The angel has a 
higher standpoint in creation than man as a basis of his knowledge of 
God, inasmuch as the substance of the angel, whereby he is led to know 
God by a process of natural knowledge, is nobler and more excellent 
than the things of sense, and even than the soul itself, whereby the 
human mind rises to the knowledge of God. But the Divine Mind exceeds 
the angelic much more than the angelic the human. For the Divine Mind 
of its own comprehensiveness covers the whole extent of its substance, 
and therefore perfectly understands its own essence, and knows all that 
is knowable about itself; but an angel of his natural knowledge does 
not know the essence of God, because the angel's own substance, whereby 
it is led to a knowledge of God, is an effect inadequate to the power 
of the cause that created it.  Hence not all things that God 
understands in Himself can be grasped by the natural knowledge of an 
angel; nor is human reason competent to take in all that an angel 
understands of his own natural ability. As therefore it would be the 
height of madness in a 'plain man' to declare a philosopher's 
propositions false, because he could not understand them, so and much 
more would a man show exceeding folly if he suspected of falsehood a 
divine revelation given by the ministry of angels, on the mere ground 
that it was beyond the investigation of reason.<A HREF="gc1_3d.htm">*</a>
<P> 

The same thing manifestly appears from the incapacity which we daily 
experience in the observation of nature. We are ignorant of very many 
properties of the things of sense; and of the properties that our 
senses do apprehend, in most cases we cannot perfectly discover the 
reason. Much more is it beyond the competence of human reason to 
investigate all the points of intelligibility in that supreme excellent 
and transcendent substance of God. Consonant with this is the saying of 
the Philosopher, that "as the eyes of bats are to the light of the sun, 
so is the intelligence of our soul to the things most manifest by 
nature" (Aristotle, <i>Metaphysics</i> I, min. i). To this truth Holy 
Scripture also bears testimony. For it is said: <i>Perchance thou wilt 
seize upon the traces of God, and fully discover the Almighty</i> (Job 
xi, 7).  And, <i>Lo, God is great, and surpassing our knowledge</i> (Job 
xxxvi, 26).  And, <i>We know in part</i> (I Cor. xiii, 9). Not everything, 
therefore, that is said of God, even though it be beyond the power of 
reason to investigate, is at once to be rejected as false.
