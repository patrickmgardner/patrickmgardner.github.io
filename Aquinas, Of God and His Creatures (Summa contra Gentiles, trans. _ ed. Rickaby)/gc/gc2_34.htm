<H1>Reasons alleged for the Eternity of the World on the part of 
the Creative Process itself, with Answers to the same</h1> 

<i>Arg. 1.</i> It is the common opinion of all philosophers, and 
therefore  it must be true, that nothing is made of nothing (Aristotle, 
<i>Physics,</i>  B. I, Chapp. <A HREF="gc1_7.htm">VII</a>, <A 
HREF="gc1_8.htm">VIII</a>). Whatever is made, then, must be made of 
something; and that again, if it is made at all, must be made of 
something else. But this process cannot go on to infinity; and 
therefore we must come to something that was not made. But every being 
that has not always been must have been made. Therefore that out of 
which all things are first made must be something everlasting. That 
cannot be God, because He cannot be the material of anything. Therefore 
there must be something eternal outside God, namely, primordial 
matter.<A HREF="gc2_34a.htm">*</a><p>  

<i>Reply</i> (Chap. XXXVII). The common position of philosophers, that 
nothing is made of nothing, is true of the sort of making that they 
considered. For all our knowledge begins in sense, which is of singular 
objects; and human investigation has advanced from particular to 
general considerations.  Hence, in studying the beginning of things, 
men gave their attention to the making of particular things in detail. 
The making of one sort of being out of another sort is the making of 
some particular being, inasmuch as it is 'this being,' not as it is 
'being' generally: for some prior being there was that now is changed 
into 'this being.' But entering more deeply into the origin of things, 
philosophers came finally to consider the issuing of all created being 
from one first cause (Chapp. <A HREF="gc2_15.htm">XV</a>, <A 
HREF="gc2_15.htm">XVI</a>). In this origin of all created being from 
God, it is impossible to allow any making out of pre-existent material: 
for such making out of pre-existent material would not be a making of 
the whole being of the creature. This first making of the universe was 
not attained to in the thought of the early physicists, whose common 
opinion it was that nothing was made of nothing: or if any did attain 
to it, they considered that such a term as 'making' did not properly 
apply to it, since the name 'making' implies movement or change,<A 
HREF="gc2_34b.htm">*</a> whereas in this origin of all being from one 
first being there can be no question of the transmutation of one being 
into another (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_17.htm">XVII</a>). Therefore it is not 
the concern of physical science to study this first origin of all 
things: that study belongs to the metaphysician, who deals with being 
in general and realities apart from motion.<A HREF="gc2_34c.htm">*</a>
We may however by a figure of speech apply the name of 'making' to 
creation, and speak of things as 'made,' whatsoever they are, the 
essence or nature whereof has its origin from other being.<p>  

<i>Arg. 2.</i> Everything that takes a new being is now otherwise than as it 
was before: that must come about by some movement or change: but all 
movement or change is in some subject: therefore before anything is 
made there must be some subject of motion.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i> The notion of motion or change is foisted in here to no 
purpose: for what nowise is, is not anywise, and affords no hold for 
the conclusion that, when it begins to be, it is otherwise than as it 
was before.<p>  

These then are the reasons which some hold to as demonstrative, and 
necessarily evincing that creatures have always existed, wherein they 
contradict the Catholic faith, which teaches that nothing but God has 
always existed, and that all else has had a beginning of being except 
the one eternal God. Thus then it evidently appears that there is 
nothing to traverse our assertion, that the world has not always 
existed. And this the Catholic faith teaches: <i>In the beginning God 
created heaven and earth</i> (Gen. i, 1): and, <i>Before he made 
anything, from the beginning</i> (Prov. viii, 22).<p>
