Eutyches, a monk of Constantinople, an extreme
opponent of Nestorius and of the Antiochene school,
and as such supported by the patriarch of Alexandria,
Dioscorus, was condemned in the Council of Chalcedon 
in 451. The Monophysite heresy, which he
started, continued to trouble the peace of the Eastern
Church and Empire for two centuries. It pervaded
Alexandria and even Antioch, under such worthy
prelates as Timothy "the Cat" (Alexandrin.) and
Peter "the Fuller" (Antiochen.)
