<H1>Connexion of what follows with what has gone before.</h1> 

There can be no perfect knowledge of anything unless its activity be 
known: for from the mode of activity proper to a thing, and the species 
to which it belongs, the measure and quality of its power is estimated; 
and the power shows the nature of the thing, for each thing is 
naturally active according to the nature with which it is actually 
endowed.<A HREF="gc2_1a.htm">*</a> But there is a twofold activity:<A 
HREF="gc2_1b.htm">*</a> one immanent in the agent, and a perfection of 
his, as feeling, understanding and willing; the other passing out to an 
exterior thing, and a perfection of the thing made and constituted 
thereby, as warming, cutting and building. Both of these acts are 
proper to God: the first, inasmuch as he understands, wills, rejoices 
and loves; the second inasmuch as He produces and brings things into 
being, conserves and governs them. Of the first act of God we have 
spoken in the previous book, treating of the divine knowledge and will. 
It remains now to treat of the second action, whereby things are 
produced and governed by God.<p>
