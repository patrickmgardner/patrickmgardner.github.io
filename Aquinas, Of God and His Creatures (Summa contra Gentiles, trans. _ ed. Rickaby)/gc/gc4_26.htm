<H1>That there are only Three Persons in the Godhead, Father and Son 
and Holy Ghost</h1> 

FROM all that has been said we gather that in the divine nature there 
subsist three Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; and that these 
three are one God, being distinct from one another by relations alone. 
The Father is distinguished by the relation of paternity and by being 
born of none: the Son is distinguished from the Father by the 
relationship of filiation: the Father and Son from the Holy Ghost by 
spiration; and the Holy Ghost from the Father and the Son by the 
procession of love whereby He proceeds from both. Besides these three 
Persons it is impossible to assign in the divine nature any fourth 
Person.<p> 

1. The three divine Persons, agreeing in essence, can be distinguished 
only by the relation of origin. These relations of origin cannot obtain 
in respect of any process tending to things without, as whatever 
proceeded without would not be co-essential with its origin; but the 
process must all stay within. Now such a process, abiding within its 
origin, is found only in the act of understanding and will.<A 
HREF="gc4_26a.htm">*</a> Hence the divine persons cannot be multiplied 
except in accordance with the requirements of the process of 
understanding and will in God. But in God there can be but one process 
of understanding, seeing that His act of understanding is one, simple, 
and perfect, whereby, understanding Himself, He understands all other 
things; and so there can be in God only one procession of the Word. In 
like manner the process of love must be one and simple, because the 
divine will also is one and simple, whereby in loving Himself God 
loves all other things. There can therefore be in God but two Persons 
proceeding: one by way of understanding, as the Word, or Son; the 
other by way of love, as the Holy Ghost: there is also one Person not 
proceeding, namely, the Father. There can only therefore be three 
Persons in the Trinity.<p> 

2. The divine Persons must be distinguished according to their mode of 
procession. Now the mode of personal procession can be but threefold. 
There may be a mode of not proceeding at all, which is proper to the 
Father; or of proceeding from one who does not proceed, which is proper 
to the Son; or of proceeding from one who does proceed, which is proper 
to the Holy Ghost. It is impossible therefore to assign more than three 
Persons.<p> 

3. If any objicient says that, the Son being perfect God, there is in 
Him perfect intellectual power, whereby He can produce a Word; and in 
like manner the Holy Ghost, being infinite goodness, which is a 
principle of communication,<A HREF="gc4_26b.htm">*</a> must be able to 
communicate the divine nature to another divine person, he should take 
note that the Son is God as begotten, not as begetting; hence the power 
of understanding is in Him as in one proceeding as a Word, not as in 
one producing a Word. In like manner the Holy Ghost being God as 
proceeding, there is in Him infinite goodness as in a person receiving, 
not as in one communicating infinite goodness to another. The whole 
fulness of Godhead then is in the Son, numerically the same as in the 
Father, but with a relation of birth, as it is in the Father with a 
relation of active generation. If the relation of the Father were 
attributed to the Son, all distinction would be taken away: for the 
divine Persons are distinguished one from another solely by their 
mutual relations. And the like argument holds of the Holy Ghost.<p> 

A likeness of the divine Trinity is observable in the human mind. That 
mind, by actually understanding itself, conceives its 'word' in itself, 
which 'word' is nothing else than what is called the 'intellectual 
expression (<i>intentio intellecta</i>, cf. B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_53.htm">LIII</a>) existing in the mind; which mind, going on 
to love itself, produces itself in the will as an object loved. Further 
it does not proceed, but is confined and complete in a circle, 
returning by love to its own substance, whence the process originally 
began by formation of the 'intellectual expression' of that substance. 
There is however a process going out to exterior effects, as the mind 
for love of itself proceeds to some action beyond itself. Thus we 
remark in the mind three things: the mind itself, whence the process 
starts within its own nature; the mind conceived in the understanding; 
and the mind loved in the will. And so we have seen that there is in 
the divine nature a God unbegotten, the Father, the origin of the 
entire procession of Deity; and a God begotten after the manner of a 
'word' conceived in the understanding, namely, the Son; and a God 
proceeding by mode of love, who is the Holy Ghost: beyond Him there is 
no further procession within the divine nature, but only a proceeding 
to exterior effects. But the representation of the divine Trinity in us 
falls short, in regard of Father, Son and Holy Ghost being one nature, 
and each of them a perfect Person.<A HREF="gc4_26c.htm">*</a> Hence 
there is said to be in the mind of man the 'image' of God: <i>Let us 
make man to our image and likeness</i> (Gen. i, 26). But as for the 
irrational creation, on account of the remoteness and obscurity of the 
representation as found in them, there is said to be the 'foot-print' 
of the Trinity, but not the 'image' (<i>vestigium, non imago</i>).
