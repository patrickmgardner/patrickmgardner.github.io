In chapter XXII it is argued that the movement of the heavenly 
spheres goes to engender things on earth (<i>motio ipsius coeli 
ordinatur ad generationem</i>).  In chapter XXIII it is argued that 
the movements of the heavenly spheres are not done mechanically, but 
are set up and kept going by intelligence, the star-bearing spheres 
being either all moved by God, or all by angels at His bidding, or 
all by the <i>primum mobile</i>, the <i>primum mobile</i> itself 
being either moved by God, or by an angel, or having a soul of its 
own, but in any case obeying God.  "It makes no difference," says St 
Thomas, "to our present purpose, whether the heavenly sphere is 
moved by a subsistent intelligence united with it as a soul, or by 
an intelligence subsisting apart; and whether each of the heavenly 
spheres is moved by God, or whether none of them is moved by Him 
immediately, but they are moved mediately through created spirits; 
or whether the first alone is moved immediately by God, and the 
others through the medium of created spirits; provided it be held 
that the movement of the heavens is the work of spirit."
