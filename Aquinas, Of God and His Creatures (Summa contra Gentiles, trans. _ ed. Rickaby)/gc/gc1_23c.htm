<i>Intentiones</i>. For <i>intentio</i> meaning <i>idea</i>, see B. I,
Chap. LIII. The reference is to archetypal ideas of
creation, something akin to the Platonic Ideas, the
"multitude of things intelligible," discussed in Chap.
L-LV of this book.  The 'Saracen jurists' (<i>Saracenorum 
in jure loquentium</i>) are apparently Avicenna
and his school, against whom these chapters are
directed.
