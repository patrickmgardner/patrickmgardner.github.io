Yes, if the intelligence sees in the substance of
God His decree for the creation of these and those
individuals. But St Thomas makes a difficulty about
the vision of the divine substance extending to a
vision of the divine decrees: see Chap. 
<A HREF="gc3_56.htm">LVI</a>, n. 4,
and the last words of this chapter. One of the Blessed
can see me in God, if he can read in God the divine
volition to create and conserve me in being. He 
cannot see me in the species 'man,' for I am not 
adequately there: my individualising accidents are not
contained in the species. Even if they were, I should
not be known as an existing, but only as a possible
being. No knowledge of the specific type of Julius
Caesar could tell you that a Julius Caesar ever actually
lived and died. This cannot be denied except by one
who is prepared to break down all distinction between 
the <i>a priori</i> scientific order and the <i>a posteriori</i>
historical order of things, and to make all beings and
events ultimately <i>a priori</i>, as part of the inevitable
evolution of the Absolute. He who will go this length
may march with Hegel, or, if he will, with Hobbes:
but St Thomas, with Aristotle, distinguishes the 
contingent from the necessary. You cannot, no one
possibly can, read the contingent in the necessary.
But all individual existence, except that of God, is
ultimately contingent; while the specific ratio is 
necessary. Cf. B. II, Chap. <A HREF="gc2_100.htm">C</a>.
