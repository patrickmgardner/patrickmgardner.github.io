<H1>That God primarily and essentially knows Himself alone</h1>

THE Understanding is in potentiality in regard of its object, in so far
as it is a different thing from that object.  If therefore the primary
and essential object of divine understanding be something different
from God, it will follow that God is in potentiality in respect of some 
other thing, which is impossible (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_16.htm">XVI</a>).<P>

5. A thing understood is the perfection of him who understands it: for 
an understanding is perfected by actually understanding, which means 
being made one with the object understood.<A HREF="gc1_48a.htm">*</a> 
If therefore anything else than God is the first object of His 
understanding, something else will be His perfection, and will be 
nobler than He, which is impossible.
