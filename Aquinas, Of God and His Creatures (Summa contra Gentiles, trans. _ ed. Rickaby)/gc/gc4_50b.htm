No one enters the kingdom of God except he have sanctifying grace. 
God's first arrangement was to give sanctifying grace to every man in 
the moment when He created the man's rational soul. To speak as we 
should speak of a human scheme, this arrangement was defeated by 
Adam's sin. Consequently upon that sin, God arranged to give 
sanctifying grace, ordinarily, not in creation, but in baptism. Before 
baptism, the infant is devoid of sanctifying grace. That void is not a 
mere negation, it is a privation: for it is an absence of that which 
the child ought to have, if it is to answer to its Maker's design of 
leading all mankind to grace and the vision of Himself. Whence this 
privation? Through the sin of Adam, the head and representative of the 
human race, and therefore of that child. This privation of 
sanctifying grace, as traceable to the sin of the first parent, is 
original sin in that child.
