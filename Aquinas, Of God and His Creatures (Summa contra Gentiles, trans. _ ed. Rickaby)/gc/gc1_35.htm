<H1>That the several Names predicated of God are not synonymous</h1>

THOUGH the names predicated of God signify the same thing, still they 
are not synonymous, because they do not signify the same point of view. 
For just as divers realities are by divers forms assimilated to the one 
simple reality, which is God, so our understanding by divers concepts 
is in some sort assimilated to Him, inasmuch as, by several different 
points of view, taken from the perfections of creatures, it is brought 
to the knowledge of Him.  And therefore our understanding is not at 
fault in forming many concepts of one thing; because that simple divine 
being is such that things can be assimilated to it in many divers 
forms. According to these divers conceptions the understanding invents 
divers names, an assigns them to God-names which, though they denote 
one and the same thing, yet clearly are not synonymous, since they are 
not assigned from the same point of view. The same meaning does not 
attach to the name in all these cases, seeing that the name signifies 
the concept of the understanding before it signifies the thing 
understood.
