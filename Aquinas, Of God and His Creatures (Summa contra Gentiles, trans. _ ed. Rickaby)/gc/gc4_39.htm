<H1>The Doctrine of Catholic Faith concerning the Incarnation</h1>

ACCORDING to the tradition of Catholic faith we must say that in Christ 
there is one perfect divine nature, and a perfect human nature, made up 
of a rational soul and human flesh; and that these two natures are 
united in Christ, not by mere indwelling of the one in the other, or in 
any accidental way, as a man is united with his garment, but in unity 
of one person.  For since Holy Scripture without any distinction 
assigns the things of God to the Man Christ, and the things of the Man 
Christ to God, He must be one and the same person, of whom both 
varieties of attributes are predicable. But because opposite attributes 
are not predicable of one and the same subject in the same respect, and 
there is an opposition between the divine and human attributes that are 
predicated of Christ, -- as that He is passible and impassible, dead 
and immortal, and the like, -- these divine and human attributes must 
be predicated of Christ in different respects. If we consider that of 
which these opposite attributes are predicated, we shall find no 
distinction to draw, but unity appears there. But considering that 
according to which these several predications are made, there we shall 
see the need of drawing a distinction.<A HREF="gc4_39a.htm">*</a> Since 
that according to which divine attributes are predicated of Christ is 
different from that according to which human attributes are predicated 
of Him, we must say that there are in Him two natures, unamalgamated 
and unalloyed. And since that of which these human and divine 
attributes are predicated is one and indivisible, we must say that 
Christ is one person, and one <i>suppositum</i>, supporting a divine 
and a human nature. Thus alone will divine attributes duly and properly 
be predicated of the Man Christ, and human attributes of the Word of 
God.<p> 

Thus also it appears how, though the Son is incarnate, it does not 
follow that the Father or the Holy Ghost is incarnate: for the 
incarnation does not have place in respect of that unity of nature 
wherein in the three Persons agree, but in respect of person and 
<i>suppositum</i>, wherein the three Persons are distinct. Thus as in 
the Trinity there is a plurality of persons subsisting in one nature, 
so in the mystery of the Incarnation there is one person subsisting 
in a plurality of natures.
