<H1>Of the Incarnation as part of the Fitness of Things</h1>

BY the fact of God having willed to unite human nature to Himself in 
unity of person, it is plainly shown to men that man can be 
intellectually united with God and see Him with an immediate vision. It 
was therefore very fitting for God to assume human nature, thereby to 
lift up man's hope to happiness. Hence since the Incarnation men have 
begun to aspire more after happiness, as Christ Himself says: <i>I have 
come that they may have life and have it more abundantly</i> (John x, 
10).<p> 

2. Although in certain respects man is inferior to some other 
creatures, and in some respects is likened to the very lowest, yet in 
respect of the end for which he is created nothing is higher than man 
but God alone: for in God alone does the perfect happiness of man 
consist. This dignity of man, requiring to find happiness in the 
immediate vision of God, is most aptly shown by God's immediate 
assumption of human nature. The Incarnation has borne this fruit, 
visible to all eyes, that a considerable portion of mankind has 
abandoned the worship of creatures, trampled under foot the pleasures 
of the flesh, and devoted itself to the worship of God alone, in whom 
alone it expects the perfect making of its happiness, according to the 
admonition of the Apostle: <i>Seek the things that are above</i> (Col. 
iii, 1).<p> 

3. Since the perfect happiness of man lies in a knowledge of God beyond 
the natural capacity of any created intelligence (B. III, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_52.htm">LII</a>), there was wanted for man in this life a 
sort of foretaste of this knowledge to guide him to the fulness of it; 
and that foretaste is by faith (B. III, Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc3_40.htm">XL</a>, <A HREF="gc3_153.htm">CLIII</a>). But this 
knowledge of faith, whereby a man is guided to his last end, ought to 
be of the highest certitude: to which perfect certitude man needed to 
be instructed by God Himself made man. So it is said: <i>No man hath 
seen God ever: the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the 
Father, he hath told us</i> (John i, 18): <i>For this I was born, and 
for this I came into the world to give testimony to the truth</i> (John 
xviii, 37). Thus we see that since the Incarnation of Christ men have 
been instructed more evidently and surely in the knowledge of God, 
according to the text: <i>The earth is filled with the knowledge of the 
Lord</i> (Isai. xi, 9).<p> 

4. Since the perfect happiness of man consists in the enjoyment of God, 
it was requisite for man's heart to be disposed to desire this 
enjoyment. But the desire of enjoying anything springs from the love of 
it. Therefore it was requisite for man, making his way to perfect 
happiness, to be induced to love God. Now nothing induces us to love 
any one so much as the experience of his love for us. Nor could God's 
love for man have been more effectually demonstrated to man than by 
God's willing to be united with man in unity of person: for this is 
just the property of love, to unite the lover with the loved.<p> 

5. Friendship resting on a certain equality, persons very unequal 
cannot be conjoined in friendship. To promote familiar friendship then 
between man and God, it was expedient that God should become man, "that 
while we know God in visible form, we may thereby be borne on to the 
love of His invisible perfections " (Mass of Christmas Day).<p> 

6. For the strengthening of man in virtue it was requisite that he 
should receive doctrine and examples of virtue from God made man, since 
of mere men even the holiest are found at fault sometimes. <i>I have 
given you an example, that as I have done so ye also do</i> (John xiii, 
15). <p> 

8. The tradition of the Church teaches us that the whole human race has 
been infected by sin. And it is part of the order of divine justice 
that sin should not be forgiven without satisfaction. But no mere man 
was able to satisfy for the sin of all mankind, since every mere man is 
something less than the whole multitude of mankind. For the deliverance 
then of mankind from their common sin, it was requisite for one to make 
satisfaction, who was at once man, so that satisfaction should be 
expected of him, and something above man, so that his merit should be 
sufficient to satisfy for the sin of the whole human race. Now in the 
order of happiness there is nothing greater than man but God alone: for 
though the angels are higher in condition of nature, they are not 
higher in respect to their final end, because they are made happy with 
the same happiness as man.<A HREF="gc4_54a.htm">*</a> It was needful 
therefore for man's attainment of happiness that God should become man, 
to take away the sin of the world (John i, 29: Rom. iv, 25: v, 18: Heb. 
ix, 28).
