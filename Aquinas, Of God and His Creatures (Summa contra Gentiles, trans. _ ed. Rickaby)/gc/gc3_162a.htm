May we not however observe that as in the
natural order of things God has provided, in the acquired 
skill of physicians and surgeons, certain ordinary means 
for healing the sick and even giving sight
to the blind, so in the supernatural order He has
provided an ordinary means for the justification of
the sinner in the Sacraments of Baptism and Penance?
Miracles are exceptional, but the forgiveness of sins is
part of the Church's daily ministry; and the <i>gratia
praeveniens</i>, necessary to bring the sinner to avail 
himself of this ministry, has to be presupposed as part of
the institution. The fuller and fuller recognition of
this consoling truth is a typical instance of the 
'development' of the mind of the Church.<p>

On the texts from <i>Romans</i> quoted here cf. 
<i>Notes on St Paul</i> pp. 393-397.
