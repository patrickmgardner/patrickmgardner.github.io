<i>In aetate Christi</i>, a conclusion suggested by
<i>aetatis plenitudinis Christi</i> (Vulgate, l. c). The 
intrinsic appropriateness of this conclusion is more striking
than its exegetical cogency. It is commonly held by
Catholics, although not with the certitude of faith.
Nor is it devoid of philosophical significance: cf B.
II, Chap. <A HREF="gc2_75.htm">LXXV</a>, B. II, Chap. 
<A HREF="gc4_81.htm">LXXXI</a>, with notes.
