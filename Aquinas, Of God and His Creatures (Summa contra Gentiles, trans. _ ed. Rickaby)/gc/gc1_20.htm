<H1>That God is Incorporeal</h1>

EVERY corporeal thing, being extended, is compound and has parts.
But God is not compound: therefore He is not anything corporeal.<P>

5. According to the order of objects is the order and distinction of 
powers: therefore above all sensible objects there is some intelligible 
object, existing in the nature of things. But every corporeal thing 
existing in nature is sensible: therefore there is determinable above 
all corporeal things something nobler than they. If therefore God is 
corporeal, He is not the first and greatest Being.<A HREF="gc1_20a.htm">*</a> 

With this demonstrated truth divine authority also agrees. For it is 
said: <i>God is a spirit</i> (John iv, 24): <i>To the King of ages, 
immortal, invisible, only God</i> (1 Tim. i, 17): <i>The invisible 
things of God are understood and discerned by the things that are 
made</i> (Rom. i, 29). For the things that are discerned, not by sight 
but by understanding, are incorporeal.<P> 

Hereby is destroyed the error of the first natural philosophers, who 
posited none but material causes. The Gentiles also are refuted, who 
set up the elements of the world, and the powers therein existing, for 
gods; also the follies of the Anthropomorphite heretics, who figured 
God under bodily lineaments; also of the Manicheans, who thought God 
was an infinite substance of light diffused through infinite space. The 
occasion of all these errors was that, in thinking of divine things, 
men came under the influence of the imagination, which can be cognisant 
only of bodily likeness. And therefore we must transcend imagination in 
the study of things incorporeal.
