It will be remembered (p. 167) that Aristotle, <i>De gen. animal.</i>, 
II, v, ascribes the vegetative soul to the female, and the sentient to 
the male. I am apt to think that St Thomas knew the work <i>De 
generatione animalium</i> only through some Mahommedan commentator, -- 
not Averroes, for the Commentator always gives the full Aristotelian 
text. This doctrine of three successive souls in man, two perishable 
and one permanent, is noteworthy; and though not now generally 
accepted, there is still something to say for it.
