<H1>Some further Elucidation of the Incarnation</h1>

EUTYCHES made the union of God and man a union of nature: Nestorius, a 
union neither of nature nor of person: the Catholic faith makes it a 
union of person, not of nature. To forestall objections, we need to 
form clear notions of what it is to be united 'in nature,' and what it 
is to be united 'in person.'<p> 

Those things then are united 'in nature,' which combine to constitute 
the integrity of some specific type, as soul and body are united to 
constitute the specific type of 'animal.' Once a specific type is set 
up in its integrity, no foreign element can be united with it in unity 
of nature without the breaking up of that specific type.<A 
HREF="gc4_41a.htm">*</a> But what is not of the integrity of the 
specific type is readily found in some individual contained under the 
species, as whiteness and clothedness in Socrates or Plato.<A 
HREF="gc4_41b.htm">*</a> All such non-specific attributes are said to 
be united 'in unity of <i>suppositum</i>,' or in the case of rational 
beings, 'in unity of person,' with the individual.<p> 

Now some have reckoned the union of God and man in Christ to be after 
the manner of things united 'in unity of nature.' Thus Arius and 
Apollinaris and Eutyches. But that is quite an impossibility. For the 
nature of the Word is a sovereignly perfect whole from all eternity, 
incapable of alteration or change: nothing foreign to the divine 
nature, -- no human nature, nor any element of human nature, -- can 
possibly come to thrust itself into that unity.<A 
HREF="gc4_41c.htm">*</a> Others saw the impossibility of this position, 
and turned aside in the contrary direction. Whatever is added to any 
nature without belonging to the integrity of the same, may be reckoned 
to be either an accident, as whiteness and music, or to stand in an 
accidental relation to the subject, as a ring, a dress, a house. 
Considering then that human nature is added to the Word of God without 
belonging to the integrity of His nature, these [Nestorians] thought 
that the union of this supperadded human nature with the Word was 
merely accidental. Manifestly, it could not be in the Word as an 
accident, for God is not susceptible of accidents; and besides human 
nature itself stands in the category of substance, and cannot be an 
accident of anything. The alternative which they embraced was to 
conclude that the human nature stood in an accidental relation with the 
Word. Nestorius then laid it down that the human nature stood to the 
word in the relation of a temple to the Deity whose temple it was; and 
that union with human nature meant a mere indwelling of the Word in 
that nature. And because a temple has its individuality apart from him 
that dwells in it, and the individuality proper to human nature is 
personality, it followed that the personality of the human nature was 
one, and the personality of the Word another; and thus the Word and the 
Man were two persons: all which conclusion has been set aside by our 
previous arguments.<p> 

We must therefore lay it down that the union of the Word with the Man 
was such, that neither was one nature compounded out of two; nor was 
the union of the Word with human nature like the union of a substance 
with something exterior to it and standing in an accidental relation to 
it, like the relation of a man to his garment and his house: but the 
Word must be considered to subsist in human nature as in a nature made 
properly its own, so that that Body is truly the Body of the Word of 
God, and that Soul the Soul of the Word of God, and the Word of God 
truly is man. And though such union cannot be perfectly explained by 
mortal man, still we will endeavour, according to our capacity and 
ability, to say something towards the building up of faith and the 
defence of this mystery of faith against unbelievers.<p> 

In all creation there is nothing so like this union as the union of 
soul and body. So the Athanasian Creed has it: "As the rational soul 
and flesh is one man, so God and man is one Christ."<A 
HREF="gc4_41d.htm">*</a> But whereas the rational soul is united with 
the body, (a) as form with matter, (b) as chief agent with instrument 
(B. II, Chapp. <A HREF="gc2_56.htm">LVI</a>, <A 
HREF="gc2_57.htm">LVII</a> ); this comparison cannot hold in respect of 
the former mode of union, for so we should be brought round to the 
[Eutychian]  conclusion, that of God and man there was made one nature. 
We must take the point of the comparison then to be the union of soul 
with body as of agent with instrument. And with this the sayings of 
some ancient Doctors agree, who have laid it down that the human nature 
in Christ is an instrument of His divinity, as the body is an 
instrument of the soul.<A HREF="gc4_41e.htm">*</a> The body and its 
parts, as instruments of the soul, come in a different category from 
exterior instruments. <i>This axe</i> is not my own proper instrument 
as is <i>this hand</i>. With <i>this axe</i> many men may work: but 
<i>this hand</i> is set aside for the proper activity of <i>this 
soul</i>. Therefore the hand is a tool conjoined with and proper to him 
that works with it: but the axe is an instrument extrinsic to the 
workman and common to many hands. Thus then we may take it to be with 
the union of God and man. All men stand to God as instruments wherewith 
He works: <i>For he it is that worketh in us to will and accomplish on 
behalf of the good will</i> (Phil. ii, 13). But other men stand to God as 
extrinsic and separate instruments. God moves them, not merely to 
activities proper to Himself, but to activities common to all rational 
nature, such as understanding truth, loving goodness, and working 
justice. But human nature has been taken up in Christ to work as an 
instrument proper to God alone, such works as cleansing of sins, 
illumination of the mind by grace, and introduction to everlasting life. 
The human nature therefore of Christ stands to God as an instrument 
proper and conjoined, as the hand to the soul.<p> 

The aforesaid examples however are not alleged as though a perfect
likeness were to be looked for in them. We must understand how easy it
was for the Word of God to unite Himself with human nature in a union
far more sublime and intimate than that of the soul with any 'proper
instrument.'
