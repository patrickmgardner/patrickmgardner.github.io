This is truly a magnificent argument. -- In these
idealist days, there is no difficulty in bringing any
theist to avow that things could not be at all, if they
dropped out of the thought of the Supreme Mind.
But God's mere thinking of them is not enough to
raise them out of the order of pure possibilities, and
transfer them into the region of actual being. To
give them actuality, God must will them; and to
keep them in existence He must will them 
continually. Cf. B. I, Chapp. <A HREF="gc1_53.htm">LIII</a>,
