<H1>How Man is delivered from Sin</h1>

BECAUSE man cannot return to one opposite without retiring from the 
other, to return to the state of righteousness he must withdraw from 
sin, whereby he had declined from righteousness. And because it is 
chiefly by the will that man is set on the way to his last end, or 
turned away therefrom, he must not only withdraw from sin in exterior 
act by ceasing to sin, but he must further withdraw in will, that so he 
may rise again by grace. Now withdrawal of the will from sin means at 
once repentance for the past and a resolution to avoid sin in future. 
For if a man did not purpose to cease from sin, sin as it is in itself 
(or sin in general) would not be contrary to his will. If he were 
minded to cease from sin, but had no sorrow for sin past, that same 
particular sin of which he was guilty would not be against his will.<A 
HREF="gc3_159a.htm">*</a> Now the will must withdraw from sin by taking 
the course contrary to that which led it into sin. But it was led into 
sin by appetite and delight in inferior things. Therefore it must 
withdraw from sin by certain penal inflictions. As delight drew it to 
consent to sin, so these inflictions strengthen it in abomination of 
sin. <p>

When then man by grace has obtained pardon for his sin and has been 
restored to the state of grace, he still remains bound by God's justice 
to some punishment for his sin. If of his own will he exacts this 
punishment of himself, he is thereby said to 'make satisfaction' to God, 
inasmuch as by punishing himself for his sin he fulfils with labour 
and pain the order instituted of heaven, which order he had 
transgressed by sinning and following his own will. But if he does not 
exact this punishment of himself it will be inflicted by God, since the 
domain of divine providence cannot be suffered to lie in disorder. The 
punishment in that case will not be called 'satisfactory,' since it will 
not be of the choice of the sufferer, but it will be called 
'purificatory,' or 'purgatorial,' because he will be purified and 
purged by another punishing him; and so whatever was inordinate in him 
will be brought back to due order. Hence the Apostle says: <i>If we were 
to judge ourselves, we should not be judged: but while we are judged, 
we are chastised by the Lord, that we may not be condemned with this 
world</i> (1 Cor. xi, 31).<p> 

Nevertheless, in the process of conversion, the disgust for sin and the 
fixing of the affections on God may be so intense as that there shall 
remain no outstanding liability to punishment. For the punishment which 
one suffers after the forgiveness of sin is necessary to bring the mind 
to cleave more firmly to good, -- punishments being medicines, -- as 
also for the observance of the order of justice in the punishment of 
the sinner. But love of God, especially when it is vehement and strong, 
is sufficient to establish man's mind in good; and intense disgust for 
a past fault carries with it great sorrow for the same. Hence by the 
vehemence of the love of God and hatred for sin there is excluded any 
further need of satisfactory or purgatorial punishment.<A 
HREF="gc3_159b.htm">*</a> And though the vehemence be not so great as 
totally to bar the punishment, nevertheless, the greater the vehemence, 
so much less of punishment will suffice.<p> 

But what we do through our friends we are reckoned to do of ourselves, 
inasmuch as friendship makes two one in heart, and this is especially 
true of the love of charity: therefore, as a man may make satisfaction 
to God of himself, so also may he do it through another, especially in 
case of necessity: for the punishment which his friend suffers on his 
account he reckons as his own punishment; and thus punishment is not 
wanting to him in that he has compassion for the sufferings of his 
friend, and that all the more for his being the cause of his friend's 
suffering. And again the affection of charity in him who suffers for 
his friend makes his satisfaction more acceptable to God than it would 
be if he were suffering for his own doings: for the one is an effort of 
spontaneous charity, the other an acquiescence in necessity. Hence we 
learn that one man may make satisfaction for another, provided both of 
them be in charity. Hence the saying of the Apostle: <i>Bear ye one 
another's burdens, and so ye shall fulfil the law of Christ</i> (Gal. 
vi, 2).
