<H1>That the Final Happiness of Man consists in the Contemplation of 
God</h1>

IF then the final happiness of man does not consist in those exterior 
advantages which are called goods of fortune, nor in goods of the body, 
nor in goods of the soul in its sentient part, nor in the intellectual 
part in respect of the moral virtues, nor in the virtues of the 
practical intellect, called art and prudence, it remains that the final 
happiness of man consists in the contemplation of truth. This act alone 
in man is proper to him, and is in no way shared by any other being in 
this world. This is sought for its own sake, and is directed to no 
other end beyond itself. By this act man is united in likeness with 
pure spirits, and even comes to know them in a certain way. For this 
act also man is more self-sufficient, having less need of external 
things.<A HREF="gc3_37a.htm">*</a> Likewise to this act all other human 
activities seem to be directed as to their end. For to the perfection 
of contemplation there is requisite health of body;<A 
HREF="gc3_37b.htm">*</a> and all artificial necessaries of life are 
means to health. Another requisite is rest from the disturbing forces 
of passion: that is attained by means of the moral virtues and 
prudence. Likewise rest from exterior troubles, which is the whole aim 
of civil life and government. Thus, if we look at things rightly, we may 
see that all human occupations seem to be ministerial to the service of 
the contemplators of truth.<A HREF="gc3_37c.htm">*</a><p> 

Now it is impossible for human happiness to consist in that 
contemplation which is by intuition of first principles, -- a very 
imperfect study of things, as being the most general, and not amounting 
to more than a potential knowledge: it is in fact not the end but the 
beginning of human study: it is supplied to us by nature, and not by 
any close investigation of truth. Nor can happiness consist in the 
sciences, the object-matter of which is the meanest things, whereas 
happiness should be an activity of intellect dealing with the noblest 
objects of intelligence. Therefore the conclusion remains that the 
final happiness of man consists in contemplation guided by wisdom to 
the study of the things of God. Thus we have reached by way of 
induction the same conclusion that was formerly established by 
deductive reasoning,<A HREF="gc3_37d.htm">*</a> that the final 
happiness of man does not consist in anything short of the 
contemplation of God.
