It will be said, -- An animal moves towards maturity and full 
strength: but therein it does not rest: it moves just as rapidly out of 
its perfection as it moved into it.  Not quite so: there is what is 
called <b>h&ecirc;likia kathest&ocirc;sa</b>, 'settled age,' 
like settled summer weather; and the more perfect the animal, the 
longer this settled age endures.
