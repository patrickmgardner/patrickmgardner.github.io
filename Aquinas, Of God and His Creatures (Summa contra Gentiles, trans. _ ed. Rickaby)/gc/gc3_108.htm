<H1>Arguments seeming to prove that Sin is impossible to Spirits, 
with Solutions of the same</h1>

ARG. 1. Every other cognitive faculty but the understanding makes use 
of living bodily organs. In pure spirits therefore it is impossible for 
there to  be any cognitive faculty but the understanding; and whatever 
they take cognisance of, they have understanding of.<A 
HREF="gc3_108a.htm">*</a>  But in so far as one has understanding, one 
does not err: for all error springs from lack of understanding.  
Therefore there can be no error in the apprehension of these spirits. 
But without such error there can be no sin in the will: because the 
will always tends to good as apprehended: hence unless there he a 
mistake in the apprehension of good, there can be no sin in the will.<A 
HREF="gc3_108b.htm">*</a><p> 

Arg. 2. In us there occurs sin of the will in respect of matters about 
which we have true knowledge of their general bearings, but on a 
particular point our judgement is hampered by some passion fettering 
the reason. But these passions cannot be in spiritual beings, because 
such passions belong to the sensitive part, and that has no action 
without a bodily organ. Having therefore a right knowledge in general, 
the will of a pure spirit cannot tend to evil by any defed of knowledge 
in particular.<p> 

Arg. 3. No cognitive faculty is deceived about its own proper object, 
but only about some object foreign to it: thus sight is not deceived in 
judging of colours, but when a man undertakes by sight to judge of 
tastes, then deception occurs. Now the proper object of understanding 
is the essence of a thing.<A HREF="gc3_108c.htm">*</a> No deception then 
is incident to the apprehension of understanding, so long as it fixes 
upon the pure quiddities of things: but all intellectual deception, we 
may think, arises from the forms of things apprehended coming to be 
mixed up with phantasms,<A HREF="gc3_108d.htm">*</a> as in our 
experience. But such a mode of cognition does not obtain in pure 
spirits, since phantasms cannot be without a body. To pure spirits 
therefore no error in cognition can possibly be incident, and 
consequently no sin in the will.<p> 

Reply to Arguments 1, 2, 3. We are not obliged to say that there was 
any error in the understanding of a pure spirit, in the shape of a 
false judgement, judging that to be good which is not good: the 
mistake, such as it was, lay in not attending to the higher good, to 
which the spirit's  private good ought to have been referred: the 
reason of which inattention [read <i>inconsiderationis ratio</i>] may 
have been the inward turning of the will upon the spirit's private 
good:<A HREF="gc3_108e.htm">*</a> for it is open to the will to turn 
more or less of its affection upon this object or upon that.<A 
HREF="gc3_108f.htm">*</a><p> 

Arg. 5. Since appetite or desire tends to nothing but its own proper 
good, it seems impossible for desire to go astray in the case when the 
person desiring has one only definite good to desire. The reason why 
sin is incident to our desire is the composition of our nature, a 
compound of the spiritual and the corporeal, occasioning a multiplicity 
of things to be good for us, one thing being good for us in mind and 
another in body. Of this variety of good things the less important has 
to be subordinated to the more important. Hence sin of the will arises 
in us when we neglect that order, and go after what is good for us 
under a certain qualification, discarding what is good for us 
absolutely. But in pure spirits there is no such composition, no 
diversity of things good for them; nay, all their good is intellectual. 
Hence it seems they are incapable of sin in the will.<p> 

Reply. The angel who sinned did not go after any other good than the 
one good that was proper to him: but his sin lay in this, that he 
dropped the higher good to which he should have subordinated himself As 
we sin by pursuing the lower goods of the body away from the order of 
reason, so the devil sinned by not referring his own excellence to the 
excellence of God.<A HREF="gc3_108g.htm">*</a><p> 

Arg. 6. In us, sin of the will arises out of excess or defect, while 
virtue lies in the mean between them. But pure spirits can pursue only 
intellectual good things, in which things no excess is possible, for of 
themselves they are in the mean between excess and defect, as truth is 
in the mean between two errors.<p> 

Reply. The devil passed the mean of virtue inasmuch as he did not 
submit himself to a superior order; and thus he gave himself more than his 
due, and to God less than His due.
