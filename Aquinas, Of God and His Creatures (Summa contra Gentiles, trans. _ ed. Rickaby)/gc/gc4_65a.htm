<i>A Domino factum est istud</i>; and how He does it, there are guesses 
many, but <i>no man knoweth</i>. We must not confound guesses as to the 
<b>p&ocirc;s</b> (the manner how) with articles of faith as to the 
<b>hoti</b> (the fact). We repeat the accredited phraseology of the 
Church: we believe in that phraseology as expressing truth in the best 
terms of human intelligence, with an expression accurate and correct, 
yet inadequate in respect of the further fulness that lies beyond our 
ken. So we wait in adoration behind closed veils, till the veil be rent 
and Christ revealed. The scoffer, on the contrary, has made up his mind 
on what he does not comprehend: in the darkness he has defined for 
himself one dogma, the absolute incredibility of Christian teaching.
