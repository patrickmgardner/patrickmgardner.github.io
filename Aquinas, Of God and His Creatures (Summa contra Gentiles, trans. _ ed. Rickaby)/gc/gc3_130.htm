<H1>That the Divine Government of Men is after the manner of Paternal 
Government</h1>

THE father has care of the child, not only in his relations with other 
men, as the king has care of him, but also in his individual concerns, 
as has been shown above of God (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_93.htm">XCIII</a>). 
And this with good reason, for a parent is like God in giving natural 
origin to a human being. Hence divine and paternal government extend to 
the individual, not merely as a member of society, but as a person 
subsisting in his own nature by himself. The two governments differ 
however in this, that paternal government can extend only to the things 
that appear in man externally, but divine government reaches also to 
interior acts and dispositions. For no man can take cognisance of 
things hidden from him: the secrets of hearts are hidden from men, 
though open to God (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_59.htm">LIX</a>). God 
therefore takes account of man not only as to his exterior behaviour, 
but also as to his inward affections, what he means to do, and what he 
intends to gain by doing it. Of such points man takes no cognisance, 
except so far as by outward acts the inward disposition is shown.<A 
HREF="gc3_130a.htm">*</a><p> 

Every one has care of things according as they belong to him: for 
solicitude about things that are no affair of yours is blamed as 
meddlesomeness. But one man belongs to another's charge otherwise than 
as he belongs to God.  One man belongs to another either by natural 
origin and bodily descent, or by some combination in external works. 
But man belongs to God inasmuch as he has his origin from Him, which 
origin means a certain likeness to God: for every being acts to the 
production of its own likeness. Now man has more of the likeness of God 
in his soul than in his body, and most of all in his mind.<A 
HREF="gc3_130b.htm">*</a> Clearly therefore, in the origin of man as 
coming from God, the main thing intended is the mind, and for the 
mind's sake the other (sentient) parts of the soul are produced by God; 
and for the soul the body is produced: so God's principal care is for 
the mind of man, -- first, for the mind; then for the other parts of 
the soul, and after them for the body. Hence it is by the mind that man 
attains his last end, which is human happiness (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_37.htm">XXXVII</a>). Other things in man serve as instruments 
for the securing of happiness. Hence we may observe that human 
government takes cognisance of interior acts so far as they are 
directed to external conduct and are thereby unfolded to view:<A 
HREF="gc3_130c.htm">*</a> but God contrariwise takes cognisance of 
external conduct so far as it points to interior dispositions, 
particularly in regard of the mind, whereby man is capable of 
happiness, -- human happiness consisting, as has been said, in the 
fruition of God. The whole care therefore that God has of man is in 
view of preparing his mind for the fruition of God, whereunto the mind 
is prepared by faith, hope and charity:<A HREF="gc3_130d.htm">*</a> for 
by faith man's mind is disposed to recognise God as a Being above 
himself: by hope it is strengthened to reach out to Him and see in Him 
man's true good: by charity it fixes upon Him so as immovably to adhere 
to Him. All things that God requires of man in this life are referable 
to these three virtues.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God ask of 
thee, except that thou fear the Lord thy God and walk in his ways?</i> 
(Deut. x, 12.) <i>Now there remain faith, hope and charity, these 
three</i> (i Cor. xiii, 13).<p> 

But because the human mind is naturally more imperfect than other 
intellectual natures; and the more perfect a thing is, the more energy 
it shows in tending to its end; it appears that the human mind is 
naturally weaker in tending to God, the end of all, than are the higher 
minds of the angels. This weakness shows itself on two points. First, 
in the deficiency of intellectual power in the human soul, as compared 
with higher intelligences, so that it cannot go straight to 
intellectual truth as it is in itself (Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc3_41.htm">XLI</a>, <A HREF="gc3_99.htm">CXIX</a>). Secondly, in 
the obstacles that keep it back from throwing itself with all its force 
upon God; obstacles on the part of the body, which claims care for 
sustenance and repose; and again obstacles on the part of the lower 
powers of the soul, inasmuch as the excitements of phantasy and the 
perturbations of passion trouble that interior peace, which is so 
necessary for the mind freely to throw itself upon God. These obstacles 
cannot be wholly removed by man from his path, so long as he lives in 
this mortal body: for he has to attend to the things necessary for this 
mortal life, and is thereby hindered from always actually tending to 
God. But the aforesaid hindrances should be so far got under that there 
should be in man's mind an intention at least, directed to God without 
interruption;<A HREF="gc3_130e.htm">*</a> and the more the mind can be 
even actually fixed on God, the more perfect will man's life be, as 
keeping nearer to its last end. And this actual fixing of the mind upon 
God will go to strengthen the intention directed towards Him, which 
intention must needs come to naught unless at times the mind be fixed 
upon Him actually. All the precepts and counsels therefore of the 
divine law go to furnish man with aids for fixing his mind on God and 
removing obstacles to such attention.<p> 

For both these purposes man needs to live at peace and concord with his 
fellow-men. For man needs to be aided by man, as well to the 
preservation of life and limb, as also to the end that one man may 
inflame and incite and instruct another to yearn after God. In the 
absence of peace and concord, man's mind must be disquieted by 
contentions and fighting, and hindered from aspiring to God. And 
therefore the divine law has made provision for the preservation of 
peace and concord amongst men by the practice of justice. It commands 
that to every man be rendered his due, as honour to parents: that none 
be harmed or hindered in the enjoyment of the good that belongs to him, 
whether by word, -- hence the prohibition of false witness, -- or by 
deed touching his own person, -- hence the prohibition of murder, -- or 
by deed touching a person allied to him, -- hence the prohibition of 
adultery, or by deed touching his property, -- hence the prohibition of 
theft. And because God takes cognisance not only of the public but also 
of the domestic behaviour of men, the divine law has forbidden neglect 
of wife, servants, etc., which is no concern of human law.<p> 

But it is not enough for peace and concord to be preserved among men by 
precepts of justice, unless there be a further consolidation of mutual 
love. Justice provides for men to the extent that one shall not get in 
the way of another, but not to the extent of one helping another in his 
need. One may happen to need another's aid in cases in which none is 
bound to him by any debt of justice, or where the person so bound does 
not render any aid. Thus there came to be need of an additional precept 
of mutual love amongst men, so that one should aid another even beyond 
his obligations in justice.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>His commandment we have received, that whoever 
loveth God should also love his brother</i> (1 John iv, 21): <i>This is my 
commandment, that ye love one another as I have loved you</i> (John xv, 
12).<p> 

It is evident that love suffices for the fulfilment of the works of 
justice. Hence it is said: <i>Love is the fulfilment of the law</i> 
(Rom. xiii, 10): to commend which fulfilment there are given us 
precepts and counsels of God concerning works of mercy, love and 
succour of enemies, and the like deeds of kindness, which overflow and 
run over the measures of justice.<p> 

But because the aforesaid precepts of justice require their completion 
in the love of one's neighbour, and that depends on the love of God; 
and when love is gone, and faith and charity are also gone, the human 
mind cannot duly tend to God; it follows that the observance of the 
precepts of the aforesaid virtues is necessarily required of man, and 
by the neglect of them man is entirely thrown out of his subordination 
to God. Now human life takes its denomination from the end to which it 
is directed. They who constitute their last end in pleasures are said 
to lead a life of pleasure. They who constitute their last end in the 
contemplation of truth are said to lead a contemplative life: hence 
whosoever constitute their last end in the enjoyment of God, their life 
is an adherence to God, which is absolutely the life of man, for to 
that end man is naturally ordained (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_37.htm">XXXVII</a>). On other ends man's life is dependent 
only in a qualified sense, inasmuch as such ends are not imposed on man 
by nature, but by his own choice.<A HREF="gc3_130f.htm">*</a> Death 
then being the opposite of life, it is a sort of death to a man to drop 
out of the order which has its last term in God.<A 
HREF="gc3_130g.htm">*</a> Hence the sins whereby a man breaks away from 
such order are called 'mortal,' or 'deadly' sins; and those 
instructions of the law whereby men are held to their engagements of 
justice, charity, hope, and faith, are called 'commandments,' or 
'prohibitions,' because they are to be of necessity observed.<p> 

As one necessary condition for the flight of the mind to God is peace 
with neighbours, with whom man has to live in society and be aided by 
them, so another necessary condition is peace and good order of the 
elements within man himself. We observe that there are two ways in 
which the free flight of the mind to God may be hindered. One way is by 
the intensification of the acts of the lower powers. When one power 
comes vigorously into action, it draws to itself the interest of man, 
which cannot be scattered over many objects simultaneously: hence 
another power must be either stopped from acting or have its activity 
diminished. By the lower powers I mean the sentient powers, as well 
apprehensive, namely, the external and internal senses, the phantasy 
and other attendant powers,<A HREF="gc3_130h.htm">*</a> as also 
appetitive, as the irascible and concupiscible faculties.<A 
HREF="gc3_130i.htm">*</a> Hence when there is strong delight in sense, 
or much excitement of phantasy, or an inclination of the concupiscible 
or of the irascible faculty to their several objects, the mind must 
necessarily be impeded in its act of ascent to God.<p> 

In another way the movement of the mind to God may be hindered on the 
part of the mind itself, by its occupation with other things: for one 
power cannot be in perfect activity over several objects 
simultaneously.<p> 

But since the mind at times uses the inferior powers as obedient 
instruments, and can occupy itself with several objects, when they all 
bear upon one and all help to apprehend that one, we must understand 
that the mind is then only hindered from its flight to God by the lower 
powers, or by its own occupation with other objects, when those powers 
or those objects bear not at all on the mind's movement to God: 
otherwise, far from being hindrances, they may be positive helps to the 
free flight of man's mind to his Creator.<A 
HREF="gc3_130j.htm">*</a><p> 

Indeed man cannot altogether avoid occupying his mind about other 
things, by the fact that he must be solicitous about the necessaries of 
his bodily life. There are however among men various degrees of this 
solicitude. The first degree of solicitude extends just so far as the 
common measure of human life requires. It involves the providing of 
necessaries for self, wife, children, and other persons belonging to 
oneself according to one's state. This degree of solicitude is lawful, 
and may be said to be connatural to man.<A HREF="gc3_130k.htm">*</a><p> 

The second degree is reached when a man is more solicitous about the 
aforesaid things of the body than the common measure of human life 
requires according to his state, without however this solicitude going 
so far as to withdraw him from his subordination to God, or making him 
transgress the commandments of justice and charity. There is evidently 
sin in this, since the man exceeds his proper measure; yet not mortal 
sin, since he undertakes nothing contrary to the precepts of justice 
and charity. His sin is called 'venial,' as being readily 'pardonable,' 
-- as well because, for one who keeps his face set towards his last 
end, any error that he may make is easily put straight, -- thus in 
speculative sciences any one who has a true conception of principles 
may thereby easily correct such errors as he may fall into in drawing 
conclusions; and the end in view in the things of action is like the 
first principle in things of speculation, -- as also because to one 
steady in friendship any delinquency is readily forgiven, -- as also 
because it is no easy matter absolutely to observe due measure and 
exceed in nothing. Hence whoever does not cast away from his heart the 
rule of reason, which is laid down by the end in view, even though he 
does not altogether observe rectitude in the things which have to be 
regulated by that rule, is not over-much to be blamed, but deserves 
pardon.<A HREF="gc3_130l.htm">*</a><p> 

The third degree is when the solicitude for temporals grows so great as 
to withdraw the soul from subordination to God, and bring it to 
transgress the commandments of justice and charity, faith and hope, 
without which man's mind cannot remain in due relation with God; and 
this is manifest mortal sin.<p> 

The fourth degree is when contrariwise man's solicitude for worldly 
things stops short of the common measure of human life. If this is 
owing to remissness and flabbiness of mind, or to any undue 
eagerness,<A HREF="gc3_130m.htm">*</a> it is to be held for a base 
proceeding: for the transgression of the golden mean in either 
direction is blameworthy. But if lower things are neglected that better 
things may be attended to, to wit, that the mind may take a free flight 
to the things of God, this is a virtue more perfect than human. To 
teach man such perfection, there have not been given him commandments, 
but rather counsels to draw him forth and incite him.<A
