As there is a difference between the work that a machine is 
theoretically capable of doing, and the work that under actual 
circumstances can be got out of it, -- one such circumstance being, 
e.g., the strength of the stoker's arm; -- so there is a difference 
between the happiness that man is absolutely capable of and the 
happiness that he can attain relatively to the conditions of this life. 
None knew better than Aristotle how far the latter grade of happiness 
falls short of the former. He would therefore fall in with all that has 
been argued about happiness in this chapter, except with the conclusion 
implied in the fourth argument. Even that argument is borrowed from 
Aristotle, who is said however to have made it matter of lamentation, 
not of hope. The Aristotelian text holds out no hope of everlasting and 
perfect happiness for the human soul after death, -- as Plato in two 
places (<i>Phaedo</i>, 114c: Phaedrus, 248c) does for the departed soul 
of the philosopher.
