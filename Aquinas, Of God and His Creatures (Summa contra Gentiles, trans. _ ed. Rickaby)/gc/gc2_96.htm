<H1>That Intelligences subsisting apart do not gather their Knowledge 
from Objects of Sense</h1>

A HIGHER power must have a higher object. But the intellectual power 
of a separately subsisting intelligence is higher than the intellectual 
power of the human soul, the latter being lowest in the order of 
intelligences (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_77.htm">LXXVII</a>). Now the object 
of the intelligence of the human soul is a phantasm (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_60.htm">LX</a>), which is higher in the order of objects than 
the sensible thing existing outside and apart from the soul.<A 
HREF="gc2_96a.htm">*</a> The object therefore of a separately 
subsisting intelligence cannot be an objective reality (<i>res</i>) 
existing outside the soul, as though it could get knowledge immediately 
from that; nor can it be a phantasm: it must then be something higher 
than a phantasm. But nothing is higher than a phantasm in the order of 
knowable objects except that which is an actual term of intelligence. 
Intelligences subsisting apart therefore do not gather their 
intellectual knowledge from objects of sense, but understand objects 
which are of themselves terms of intelligence.<A 
HREF="gc2_96b.htm">*</a><p> 

3. According to the order of intelligences is the order of terms of 
intelligence. But objects that are of themselves terms of intelligence 
are higher in order than objects that are terms of intelligence only 
because we make them so. Of this latter sort are all terms of 
intelligence borrowed from sensible things: for sensible things are not 
of themselves intelligible: yet these sensible things are the sort of 
intelligible things that our intellect understands. A separately 
subsisting intelligence therefore, being superior to our intelligence, 
does not understand the intellectual aspects of things by gathering 
them from objects of sense: it seizes upon those aspects as they are in 
themselves.<p>

4. The manner of activity proper to a thing corresponds to the manner 
and nature of its substance. But an intelligence subsisting apart is 
by itself, away from any body. Therefore its intellectual activity will 
be conversant with objects not based upon anything corporeal.<p>

From these considerations it appears that in intelligences subsisting 
apart there is no such thing as active and potential intellect, except 
perchance by an improper use of those terms. The reason why potential 
and active intellect are found in our intelligent soul is because it has 
to gather intellectual knowledge from sensible things: for the active 
intellect it is that turns the impressions, gathered from sensible 
things, into terms of intellect: while the potential intellect is in 
potentiality to the knowledge of all forms of sensible things. Since 
then separately subsisting intellects do not gather their knowledge 
from sensible things, there is in them no active and potential 
intellect.<p>

Nor again can distance in place hinder the knowledge of a disembodied 
soul (<i>animae separatae</i>). Distance in place ordinarily affects 
sense, not intellect, except incidentally, where intellect has to 
gather its <i>data</i> from sense. For while there is a definite law 
of distance according to which sensible objects affect sense, terms of 
intellect, as they impress the intellect, are not in <i>place</i>, but 
are separate from bodily matter. Since then separately subsistent 
intelligences do not gather their intellectual knowledge from sensible 
things, distance in place has no effect upon their knowledge.<A 
HREF="gc2_96c.htm">*</a><p>

Plainly too neither is time mingled with the intellectual activity of 
such beings. Terms of intellect are as independent of time as they are 
of place. Time follows upon local motion, and measures such things 
only as are in some manner placed in space; and therefore the 
understanding of a separately subsisting intelligence is above time. 
On the other hand, time is a condition of our intellectual activity, 
since we receive knowledge from phantasms that regard a fixed time. 
Hence to its judgements affirmative and negative our intelligence 
always appends a fixed time, except when it understands the essence of 
a thing. It understands essence by abstracting terms of understanding 
from the conditions of sensible things: hence in that operation it 
understands irrespectively of time and other conditions of sensible 
things. But it judges affirmatively and negatively by applying forms 
of understanding, the results of previous abstraction, to things, and 
in this application time is necessarily understood as entering into the 
combination.<A HREF="gc2_96d.htm">*</a><p>
