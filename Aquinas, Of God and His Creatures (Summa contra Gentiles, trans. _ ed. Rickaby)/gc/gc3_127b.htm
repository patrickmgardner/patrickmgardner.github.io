"The male line, if clean, and the male calves,
are used for sacrifice by the Egyptians universally;
but the females they are not allowed to sacrifice,
since they are sacred to Isis" (Herodotus, ii, 41).
Rawlinson says, "in order to prevent the breed of
cattle being diminished: but some mysterious reason
being assigned for it, the people were led to respect
an ordinance which might not otherwise have been
attended to." He quotes Porphyry, <i>De abstin.</i> ii, 11,
who doubtless was St Thomas's authority. The sacrifice 
and eating of bull beef in Egypt is described by
Herodotus, ii, 40.
