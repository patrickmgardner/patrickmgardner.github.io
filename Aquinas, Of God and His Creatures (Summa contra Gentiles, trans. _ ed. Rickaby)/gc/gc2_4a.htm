We have not gained by the divorce between philosophy and what is now 
called 'science,' as though philosophy were not science, or (physical) 
science were not one branch of philosophy. The word 'philosopher' in 
the text therefore includes the physicist. Nor does the word 
'philosopher' exclude the 'faithful Christian man.' It is a difference 
of formalities, or characters, as between 'professor' and 'volunteer,' 
not an incompatibility.
