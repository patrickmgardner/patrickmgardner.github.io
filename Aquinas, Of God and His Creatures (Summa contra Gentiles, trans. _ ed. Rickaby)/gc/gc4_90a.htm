In itself it is so: it is a good quality to be open
to sensible impressions: but what if the impressions
that come in are disquieting, disgusting, dreadful,
the sensible settings of a vision of woe? The unsolved
difficulty of the subject is to know how pure spirits,
having no organs of sense, are cognisant of anything
