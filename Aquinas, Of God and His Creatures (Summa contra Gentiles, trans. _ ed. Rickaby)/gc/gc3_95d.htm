In the above passage, inadvertently perhaps, St
Thomas admirably hits off the real meaning of what
he and Aristotle called 'contingent' events, 
<b>symbeb&ecirc;kota</b>. An event is 'contingent' 
in reference to a particular system, but (apart from 
the doings of free will) every event is 'necessary' 
in the 'general system,' on the hypothesis of that 
system being. The killing of a sheep by lightning (see 
<A HREF="gc3_94a.htm">note [3.94a]</a>)is a
contingency unprovided for in ovine economy, but
pre-arranged in the general system of the universe,
in which general system it is an hypothetical necessity: 
it must be, if the system is to stand as it is.
