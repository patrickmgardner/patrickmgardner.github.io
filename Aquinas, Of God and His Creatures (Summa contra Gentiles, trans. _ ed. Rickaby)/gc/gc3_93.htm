<H1>Of Fate, whether there be such a thing, and if so, what it is</h1>

SOME when they say that all things are done by fate, mean by fate the 
destiny<A HREF="gc3_93a.htm">*</a> that is in things by disposition of 
divine providence.  Hence Boethius says: "Fate is a disposition 
inherent in changeable things, whereby providence assigns them each to 
their several orders."  In this description of fate 'disposition' is 
put for 'destiny.'  It is said to be 'inherent in things,' to 
distinguish fate from providence: for destiny as it is in the divine 
mind, not yet impressed on creation, is providence; but inasmuch as 
it is already unfolded in creatures, it is called 'fate.'  He says 'in 
changeable things' to show that the order of providence does not take 
away from things their contingency and changeableness.  In this 
understanding, to deny fate is to deny divine providence.  But because 
with unbelievers we ought not even to have names in common, lest from 
agreement in terminology there be taken an occasion of error, the 
faithful should not use the name of 'fate,' not to appear to fall in 
with those who construe fate wrongly, subjecting all things to the 
necessity imposed by the stars.<A HREF="gc3_93b.htm">*</a>  Hence 
Augustine says: "If any man calls by the name of fate the might or 
power of God, let him keep his opinion, but mend his speech" (<i>De 
civit. Dei</i>, V, 1).  And Gregory: "Far be it from the minds of the 
faithful to say that there is such a thing as fate" (<i>Hom. 10 in 
Epiphan.</i>)
