St Thomas also appeals to Isaias lxvi, 9, in the
Vulgate reading. He says: "To whatever meaning
the term 'generation' is applied, still the reasoning
put in the mouth of God remains firm and stable,
that if He gives generation to others, He should not
Himself be barren: since a perfection must always
exist in a nobler way in the cause than in the things
caused." But the reading in Isaias is uncertain, and
the application to the eternal generation of the Word
has seemed to many, even Catholic commentators, not
to suit the text. Revelation is gradual, and must not
be antedated.
