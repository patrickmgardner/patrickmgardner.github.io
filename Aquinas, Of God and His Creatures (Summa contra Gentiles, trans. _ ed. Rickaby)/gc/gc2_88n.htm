It will be seen that the body of this argument, though not the 
conclusion, is the doctrine combatted by St Thomas above, "Nor again 
can it be said," etc., p. 175. St Thomas would not allow that the 
first sentient soul, which he supposes to be infused into man, the 
human foetus, and afterwards to perish, is "potentially intelligent." 
He holds that it does not turn into a rational soul, but simply ceases 
to be, when the rational soul comes in. "The intelligent soul which 
supervenes is another substance altogether" from the sentient soul in 
the mature and intelligent man (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_58.htm">LVIII</a>).
