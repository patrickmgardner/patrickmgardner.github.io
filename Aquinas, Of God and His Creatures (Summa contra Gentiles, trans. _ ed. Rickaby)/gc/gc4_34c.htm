"Enough," says St Thomas, "that the body is
of the mother, though the soul is not. Suitably 
therefore is the Blessed Virgin said to be the mother of
the Word of God, and even of God, though the
divinity of the Word is not borrowed from a mother.
There is no need of a son borrowing all his substance
from his mother, but only his body" (above, n. 13) --
Mary is the mother of Him who is God. She is not
mother of the Godhead, or divine nature. Neither is
any man's mother mother of his soul.
