Rain without any working of the elements (<i>sine
operatione principiorum naturae</i>) would be a miracle of
the first rank, which we do not venture to pray for
when we pray for rain. No doubt, St Thomas means
'without any working of the elemental powers sufficient 
of itself to produce the effect.' There seems to
be a certain law of parsimony about miracles, God
using natural causes so far as they will go, and eking
them out by divine or angelic power, when of themselves 
they would go no further to His purpose. In
my <i>Oxford and Cambridge Conferences</i>, First Series,
1897-1899, there is a discussion on the compatibility
of miracle with the invariability of the laws of
nature.
