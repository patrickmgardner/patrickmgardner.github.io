<i>Receptione propinqua apprehensioni</i>. M. l'Abb&eacute; Ecalle in 
his French translation (Viv&eacute;s, Paris, 1854) has <i>d'une 
mani&egrave;re qui est une disposition prochaine &agrave; 
l'apprehension proprement dite</i>. He takes the form to be in the 
storehouse of phantasy or memory before is in the intellectual faculty. 
I take it to be first seized by the apprehensive faculty, then 
consigned to the storehouse, from whence it is brought out again and 
re-apprehended at will. So I understand the words that follow, of 
revival, not of first apprehension.<p> For a loan of this translation, 
the only translation that I have seen, I am indebted to the kindness of 
the  Reverend James Bredin, late Professor of Chemistry at Oscott 
College.
