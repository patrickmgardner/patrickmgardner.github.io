This doctrine is not devoid of difficulties. Love and hatred are 
certain relative affections. Can it be then that God has no more love 
for me, now that He has created me, than He would have had for me as a 
mere possible creature never to be realised? no more hatred of the sin 
that I have committed than of the sin that I might commit? Not so, for 
God loves more where He sees more of His own, and hates more that which 
is in greater opposition to Himself. There is more of God in an 
existing reality than in a possible one; and sin is in greater 
opposition to God for being actually committed. Hence greater love and 
greater hatred. Is not God then more closely related to actualities than 
to potentialities? But, St Thomas would contend, the relation, 
even though closer, still remains conceptual. God is not really 
affected by my existing, or by anything of my doing.
