<H1>That Divine Grace causes in us Faith</h1>

THE movement of grace, guiding us to our last end, is voluntary, not 
violent (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_149.htm">CXLIX</a>). But there can be no 
voluntary movement towards an object unless the object be known. 
Therefore grace must afford us a knowledge of our last end. But such 
knowledge cannot be by open vision in our present state (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_48.htm">XLVIII</a>): therefore it must be by faith.<A 
HREF="gc3_153a.htm>*</a><p> 

2. In every knowing mind, the mode of knowledge follows the mode of 
nature: hence an angel, a man, and a dumb animal have different modes 
of knowledge according to their differences of natures. But, for the 
gaining of his last end, man has a perfection superadded to him, over 
and above his nature, namely, grace. Therefore there must also be 
superadded to him a knowledge, over and above his natural knowledge, 
and that is the knowledge of faith, which is of things not discerned by 
natural reason.<p> 

3. As when wood is first warmed by fire, the fire does not take kindly 
to the wood; but finally, when the wood is all ablaze, the fire becomes 
as it were connatural to the wood and a part of its very being: or as 
when a pupil is taught by a master, he must, to start with, take in the 
ideas of the master, not as understanding them of himself, but in the 
spirit of one ready to accept on another's word things beyond his 
capacity; and so in the end, when his education is advanced, he will be 
able to understand those things: in like manner, before we arrive at 
our final end, which is the clear vision of the First Truth as it is in 
itself, the intellect of man must submit to God in readiness to take His 
word; and that submission and readiness to believe is the work of 
divine grace.<p> 

4. See further, B. I, Chapp. <A HREF="gc1_4.htm">IV</a>, <A 
HREF="gc1_5.htm">V</a>.<p>

Hence the Apostle says: <i>By grace ye are saved through faith; and 
that not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God</i> (Eph. ii, 8).<p> 

Hereby is refuted the error of the Pelagians, who said that the 
beginning of faith in us was not of God, but of ourselves.
