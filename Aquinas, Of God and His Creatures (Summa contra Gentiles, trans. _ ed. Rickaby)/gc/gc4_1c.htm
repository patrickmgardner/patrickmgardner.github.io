A somewhat free translation, still, I think, a fair rendering of the 
sense of the Latin: <i>Oportet igitur processum emanationis a Deo uniri 
quidem in ipso principio, multiplicari autem secundum res infimas ad 
quas terminatur</i>. How reconcile this statement with the law of 
biology, that simplicity (one organ for all work) prevails in the lower 
types, differentiation in the higher? A reconciliation may be sought 
from St Thomas himself, B. III, Chap. <A HREF="gc3_77.htm">LXXVII</i>, 
where he argues that perfection implies unity of direction, with 
multiplicity of subordinates, -- in one word, organisation.
