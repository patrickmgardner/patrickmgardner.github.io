It is possible, I fear, in any school of learning
to pass examinations and take degrees, philosophical
and theological, by consistent repeating of an accepted
phraseology that one does not really understand.  What
is the meaning of the axiom that God is His
own goodness, His own wisdom, His own power,
and the rest? It means that goodness, wisdom,
power, is inseperable from God; and that each of
the divine attributes, could we but view it adequately, 
would be found to involve all the rest. On
the other hand, any given man, as Dr Smith, is not
inseparable from his own learning except hypothetically, 
if his learning is to be at all, inasmuch
as Dr Smith's learning has and can have no existence 
apart from Dr Smith. Formally speaking, the
Doctor gives being to his own learning, so long as it
lasts.  But, besides that he might die and his learning
with him -- whereas God and God's goodness cannot
cease to be -- he might also forget all that he knows,
and still remain Dr Smith. Nor does his learning involve 
his other attributes, his stature, for example,
or his irascibility.
