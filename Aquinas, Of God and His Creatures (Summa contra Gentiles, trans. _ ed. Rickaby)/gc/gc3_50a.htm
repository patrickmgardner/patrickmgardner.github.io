Mankind would be a race of philosophers, if this were true of the 
generality of men. Men generally will not take the trouble of thinking, 
they have not the ability, they have not the time (B. I, Ch. <A 
HREF="gc1_4.htm">IV</a>). St Thomas is speaking of beings in a perfect 
state, where all solicitudes are removed, and all passions are under 
control (or wholly absent), and intellect has perfect sway.
