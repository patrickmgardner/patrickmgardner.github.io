"On the saying of Gregory, 'Often they who
might have contemplated God in peace and quiet,
have fallen and given way under the burden of 
occupations; and others who, had they had occupation,
would have lived well and profitably to mankind,
have perished under the sword of their own peace
and quiet,' -- it is to be remarked that persons of
strong passionate inclinations, which tempt them to
impetuous actions, are, absolutely speaking, better
fitted for an active life, owing to the restlessness of
their Spirit. Hence Gregory Says: 'Some are so restless 
that if they get rest from labour, they labour
all the more grievously, because the more liberty and
free time they have for their own thoughts, the worse
storms they endure in their hearts.' Others again
have naturally a purity and peace of soul fitting them
for contemplation; and if these persons are totally set
aside for active occupations, they will suffer loss
(<i>Sum. Theol.</i> 2a-2ae, q. 182, art. 4: <i>Aquinas 
Ethicus</i>, II, 390).
