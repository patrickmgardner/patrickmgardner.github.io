<H1>Of the Opinion of Avicenna, who supposed Intellectual Forms not to be 
preserved in the Potential Intellect<A HREF="gc2_74a.htm">*</a></h1>

THE above arguments (against Averroes) seem to be obviated by the 
theory of Avicenna. He says that intellectual impressions do not remain 
in the potential intellect  except just so long as they are being 
actually understood.<A HREF="gc2_74b.htm">*</a> And this he 
endeavours to prove from the fact that forms are actually apprehended 
so long as they remain in the faculty that apprehends them: thus in the 
act of perception both sense and intellect become identified with their 
objects:<A HREF="gc2_74c.htm">*</a> hence it seems that whenever sense 
or intellect is united with its object, as having taken its form, 
actual apprehension, sensible or intellectual, occurs. But the 
faculties which preserve forms which not actually apprehended, he says, 
are not the faculties that apprehend those forms, but storehouses 
(<i>thesauros</i>) attached to the said apprehensive faculties. Thus 
phantasy is the storehouse of forms apprehended by sense; and memory, 
according to him, is the storehouse of notions apprehended independently 
of sensation, as when the sheep apprehends the hostility of the wolf.  
The capacity of these faculties for storing up forms not actually 
apprehended<A HREF="gc2_74d.htm">*</a> comes from their having certain 
bodily organs in which the forms are received, such reception following 
close upon the (first) apprehension;<A HREF="gc2_74e.htm">*</a> and 
thereby the apprehensive faculty, turning to these storehouses, 
apprehends in act. But it is acknowledged that the potential intellect 
is an apprehensive faculty, and has no bodily organ: hence Avicenna 
concludes that it is impossible for intellectual impressions to be 
preserved in the potential intellect except so long as it is actually 
understanding. Therefore, one of three things: either (i) these 
intellectual impressions must be preserved in some bodily organ, or 
faculty having a bodily organ: or (2) they must be self-existent 
intelligible forms, to which our potential intellect stands in the 
relation of a mirror to the objects mirrored: or (3) whenever the 
potential intellect understands, these intellectual impressions must 
flow into it afresh from some separate agent. The first of these three 
suppositions is impossible: because forms existing in faculties that 
use bodily organs are only potentially intelligible.<A 
HREF="gc2_74f.htm">*</a> The second supposition is the opinion of 
Plato, which Aristotle rejects. Hence Avicenna concludes that, whenever 
we actually understand, there flow into our potential intellect 
intellectual impressions from the active intellect, which he assumes to 
be an intelligence subsisting apart. If any one objects against him 
that then there is no difference between a man when he first learns, 
and when he wishes to review and study again something which he has 
learnt before, he replies that to learn and con over again what we know 
is nothing else than to acquire a perfect habit of uniting ourselves 
with the (extrinsic) active intelligence, so as to receive therefrom 
the intellectual form; and therefore, before we come to reflect on and 
use our knowledge, there is in man a bare potentiality of such 
reception, but reflection on our knowledge is like potentiality reduced 
to act. And this view seems consonant with what Aristotle teaches, that 
memory is not in the intellectual but in the sensitive part of the 
soul.<A HREF="gc2_74g.htm">*</a> So it seems that the preservation of 
intellectual impressions does not belong to the intellectual part of 
the soul.<A HREF="gc2_74h.htm">*</a> But on careful consideration this 
theory will be found ultimately to differ little or nothing from the 
theory of Plato. Plato supposed forms of intellect to be separately 
existing substances, whence knowledge flowed in upon our souls: 
Avicenna supposes one separate substance, the active intellect, to be 
the source when knowledge flows in upon our souls. Now it makes no 
matter for the acquirement of knowledge whether our knowledge is caused 
by one separate substance or by several. Either way it will follow that 
our knowledge is not caused by sensible things: the contrary of which 
conclusion appears from the fact that any one wanting in any one sense 
is wanting in acquaintance with the sensible objects of which that 
sense takes cognisance.<p> 

1. It is a novelty to say that the potential intellect, viewing the 
impressions made by singular things in the phantasy, is lit up by the 
light of the active intellect to know the universal; and that the 
action of the lower faculties, phantasy, memory, and cogitative 
faculty, fit and prepare the soul to receive the emanation of the 
active intellect. This, I say, is novel and strange doctrine: for we 
see that our soul is better disposed to receive impressions from 
intelligences subsisting apart, the further it is removed from bodily 
and sensible things: the higher is attained by receding from the lower. 
It is not therefore likely that any regarding of bodily phantasms 
should dispose our soul to receive the influence of an intelligence 
subsisting apart. Plato made a better study of the basis of his 
position: for he supposed that sensible appearances do not dispose the 
soul to receive the influence of separately subsisting forms, but 
merely rouse the intellect to consider knowledge that has been already 
caused in it by an external principle: for he supposed that from the 
beginning knowledge of all things intellectually knowable was caused in 
our souls by separately existing forms, or ideas: hence learning, he 
said, was nothing else than recollecting.<A HREF="gc2_74i.htm">*</a><p>

3. Intellectual knowledge is more perfect than sensory. If therefore in 
sensory knowledge there is some power of preserving apprehensions, much 
more will this be the case in intellectual knowledge.<p> 

6. This opinion is contrary to the mind of Aristotle, who says that the 
potential intellect is "the place of ideas": which is tantamount to 
saying that it is a "storehouse" of intellectual impressions, to use 
Avicenna's own phrase.<p> 

The arguments to the  contrary are easily solved. For the potential 
intellect is perfectly actuated about intellectual impressions when it 
is actually considering them: when it is not actually considering them, 
it is not perfectly actuated about them, but is in a condition 
intermediate between potentiality and actuality.<A HREF="gc2_74j.htm">*</a> 
As for memory, that is located in the sentient part of the soul, 
because the objects of memory fall under a definite time for there is 
no memory but of the past; and therefore, since there is no abstraction 
of its object from individualising conditions, memory does not belong 
to the intellectual side of our nature, which deals with universals 
This however does not bar the potential intellect's preservation of 
intellectual impressions, which are abstracted from all particular 
conditions.<p>
