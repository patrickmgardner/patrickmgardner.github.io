<H1>That the Philosopher and the Theologian view Creatures from 
Different Standpoints</h1> 

Human philosophy considers creatures as they are in themselves: hence 
we find different divisions of philosophy according to the different 
classes of things. But Christian faith considers them, not in 
themselves, but inasmuch as they represent the majesty of God, and in 
one way or another are directed to God, as it is said: <i>Of the glory 
of the Lord his work is full: hath not the Lord made his saints to tell 
of his wonders?</i> (Ecclus xlii, 16, 17.) Therefore the philosopher 
and the faithful Christian (<i>fidelis</i>) consider different points 
about creatures: the philosopher considers what attaches to them in 
their proper nature: the faithful Christian considers about creatures 
only what attaches to them in their relation to God, as that they are 
created by God, subject to God, and the like.<A HREF="gc2_4a.htm">*</a> 
Hence it is not to be put down as an imperfection in the doctrine of 
faith, if it passes unnoticed many properties of things, as the 
configuration of the heavens, or the laws of motion. And again such 
points as are considered by philosopher and faithful Christian alike, 
are treated on different principles: for the philosopher takes his 
stand on the proper and immediate causes of things; but the faithful 
Christian argues from the First Cause, showing that so the matter is 
divinely revealed, or that this makes for the glory of God, or that 
God's power is infinite. Hence this speculation of the faithful 
Christian ought to be called the highest wisdom, as always regarding 
the highest cause, according to the text: <i>This is your wisdom and 
understanding before the nations</i> (Deut. iv, 6). And therefore human 
philosophy is subordinate to this higher wisdom; and in sign of this 
subordination divine wisdom sometimes draws conslusions from premises 
of human philosophy. Further, the two systems do not observe the same 
order of procedure. In the system of philosophy, which considers 
creatures in themselves and from them leads on to the knowledge of God, 
the first study is of creatures and the last of God; but in the system 
of faith, which studies creatures only in their relation to God, the 
study is first of God and afterwards of creatures; and this is a more 
perfect view, and more like to the knowledge of God, who, knowing 
Himself, thence discerns other beings. Following this latter order, 
after what has been said in the first book about God in Himself, it 
remains for us to treat of the beings that come from God.<p>
