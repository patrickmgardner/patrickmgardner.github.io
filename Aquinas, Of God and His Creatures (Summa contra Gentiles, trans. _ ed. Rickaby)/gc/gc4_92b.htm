Plato, <i>Theaetetus</i>, 199b. "When the various
articles of knowledge are flying about in the aviary of
his mind, wishing to catch a certain article out of the
general store, he takes the wrong one by mistake, as
it were getting hold of the ring-dove, which he had
in his mind, when he wanted the pigeon."
