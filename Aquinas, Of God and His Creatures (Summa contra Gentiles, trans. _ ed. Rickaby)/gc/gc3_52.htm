<H1>That no Created Substance can of its natural power arrive to see 
God as He essentially is</h1> 

THE property of a higher nature cannot be attained by a lower nature 
except by the action of that higher nature to which it properly 
belongs. But to see God by the divine essence is the property of the 
divine nature: for it is proper to every agent to act by its own proper 
form. Therefore no subsistent intelligence can see God by the divine 
essence except through the action of God bringing it about.<p> 

5. To see the substance of God transcends the limits of every created 
nature: for it is proper to every intelligent created nature to 
understand according to the mode of its substance: but the divine 
substance is not intelligible according to the mode of any created 
substance (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_49.htm">XLIX</a>).<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>The grace of God is life everlasting</i> (Rom. vi, 
23). For we have shown that the happiness of man consists in the vision 
of God, which is called <i>life everlasting</i>, whereunto we are led 
solely by the grace of God, because such vision exceeds the faculty of 
every creature, and it is impossible to attain it except by an 
endowment from God. And the Lord says: <i>I will manifest myself to 
him</i> (John xiv, 21).<p>
