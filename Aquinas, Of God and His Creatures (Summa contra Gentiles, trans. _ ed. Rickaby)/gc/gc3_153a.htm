Why not by reason? The answer is given in the
next argument. The work of our salvation must be
all of a piece. The essential means to a supernatural
end must be themselves supernatural. Grace however
is no miraculous illumination of the intellect, no 
private revelation of the mysteries of God: it supposes
the Christian tradition handed down from man to
man, rationally taught and rationally grasped: but it
disposes us to accept that tradition as we hear it, and
it assists the teaching Church to preserve it.
