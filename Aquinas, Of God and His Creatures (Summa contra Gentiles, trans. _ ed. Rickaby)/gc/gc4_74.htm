<h1>Of the Sacrament of Order</h1>

SINCE Christ intended to withdraw His bodily presence from the Church, 
He needed to institute other men as ministers to Himself, who should 
dispense the Sacraments to the faithful. Hence He committed to His 
disciples the consecration of His Body and Blood, saying: <i>Do this in 
memory of me</i> (Luke xxii, 19). He gave them the power of forgiving 
sins, according to the text: <i>Whose sins you shall forgive, they are 
forgiven them</i> (John xx, 23).<A HREF="gc4_74a.htm">*</a> He enjoined 
on them the function of baptising: <i>Go, teach all nations, baptising 
them</i> (Matt. xxviii, 19). Now a minister stands to his master as an 
instrument to a prime agent. An instrument must be proportionate to the 
agent: therefore the ministers of Christ must be conformable to Him. 
But Christ, our Lord and Master, by His own power and might worked out 
our salvation, inasmuch as He was both God and man. As man, He suffered 
for our redemption: as He was God, His suffering brought salvation to 
us. The ministers of Christ then must be men, and at the same time have 
some share in the Divinity (<i>aliquid divinitatis participare</i>) in 
point of spiritual power: for an instrument too has some share in the 
power of the prime agent.<A HREF="gc4_74b.htm">*</a><p> 

Nor can it be said that this power was given to the disciples of Christ 
not to be transmitted to others. It was <i>given unto edification</i> 
(2 Cor. xiii, 10), to the building up of the Church, and must be 
perpetuated so long as the Church needs building up, that is, <i>to the 
end of the world</i> (Matt. xxviii, 20). And since spiritual effects 
are transmitted to us from Christ under sensible signs, this power had 
to be delivered to men under some such signs, -- certain forms of 
words, definite acts, as imposition of hands, anointing, the delivery 
of a book or chalice, and the like.<A HREF="gc4_74c.htm">*</a> 
Whenever anything spiritual is delivered under a corporeal sign, that 
is called a Sacrament.<A HREF="gc4_74d.htm">*</a> Thus in the 
conferring of spiritual power a Sacrament is wrought, which is called 
the Sacrament of Order. Now it is a point of divine liberality that the 
bestowal of power should be accompanied with the means of duly 
exercising that power. But the spiritual power of administering the 
Sacraments requires divine grace for its convenient exercise: therefore 
in this Sacrament, as in other Sacraments, grace is bestowed.<p> 

Among Sacraments the noblest, and that which sets the crown on the 
rest, is the Sacrament of the Eucharist. Therefore the power of Order 
must be considered chiefly in relation to this Sacrament: for 
everything is ruled by the end for which it is made. Now the power that 
gives perfection, also prepares the matter to receive it.<A 
HREF="gc4_74e.htm">*</a> Since then the power of Order extends to the 
consecration of the Body of Christ and the administration of the same 
to the faithful, it must further extend to the rendering of the 
faithful fit and worthy for the reception of that Sacrament. But the 
believer is rendered fit and worthy by being free from sin: otherwise 
he cannot be united with Christ spiritually, with whom he is 
sacramentally united in the reception of this Sacrament.<A 
HREF="gc4_74f.htm">*</a> The power of Order therefore must extend to 
the remission of sins by the administration of those Sacraments which 
are directed to that purpose, Baptism and Penance.<A
