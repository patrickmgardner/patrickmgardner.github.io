<H1>That the Object of the Will of God in the First Place is God Himself</h1>

GOOD understood is the object of the will.  But what is understood by 
God in the first place is the divine essence: therefore the divine 
essence is the first object of the divine will.<p> 

3. The object in the first place willed is the cause of willing to 
every willing agent.  For when we say, 'I wish to walk for the benefit 
of my health,' we consider that we are assigning a cause; and if we are 
further asked, 'Why do you wish to benefit your health?' we shall go on 
assigning causes until we come to the final end, which is the object 
willed in the first place, and is in itself the cause of all our 
willing.  If then God wills anything else than Himself in the first 
place, it will follow that that 'something else' is to Him a cause of 
willing. But His willing is His being (Chap. <a 
href="gc1_73.htm">LXXIII</a>), Therefore something else will be the 
cause of His being, which is contrary to the notion of the First 
Being.
