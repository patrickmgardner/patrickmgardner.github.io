These are three technical terms of Aristotelian philosophy.
They refer to the category of coexistence, or coincidence,
not to sequence.  They are explained by Aristotle,
<i>Physics</i>, II, iv, v, vi:<p><ul>
<li>Matter of luck, <i>fortuitum</i>, <b>to apo tuch&ecirc;s</b>.
<li>Matter of chance, <i>casuale</i>, <b>to apo tou automatou</b>.
<li>Matter or rare occurrence, <i>ut in paucioribus accidens</i>,
<b>to m&ecirc; &ocirc;s epi to polu</b>.</ul><p>

He tells us (l.c., vi): "Matter of <i>luck</i> is all matter
of <i>chance</i>, but not all the latter is matter of <i>luck</i>. . . .
No inanimate thing, nor beast, nor child, ever does
anything by <i>luck</i>, because it is incapable of deliberate
choice. . . .  In things done for an end, when the
action of some external cause was not done to bring about
what actually happened, we may say that the thing
happened <i>by chance</i>: but those things happen <i>by luck</i>,
which happen <i>by chance</i>, and at the same time rank
as objects of choice to persons having the faculty of
choice."
