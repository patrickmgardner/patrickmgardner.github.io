So the text is explained by SS. Hilary, Ambrose
and Augustine. But from passages in the same gospel,
where the phrase <i>That which my Father hath given me</i>
recurs (John vi, 37, 39: xvii, 2, 11, 12, 24: xviii,
9), it is argued to mean the elect. The meaning then
would be: 'The elect are stronger than all the world
beside,' -- the sentiment of 1 John v, 4: <i>All that is
born of God overcometh the world</i>. In this interpretation,
our Lord speaks, not as the Eternal Son, but as Man
and Redeemer: in which capacity many understand
him to speak also in the other passages, John iii, 35
Matt. xi, 27.
