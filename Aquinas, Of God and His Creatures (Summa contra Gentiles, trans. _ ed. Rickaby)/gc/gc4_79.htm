<h1>That through Christ the Resurrection of our Bodies will take 
place</h1>

AS we have been delivered by Christ from the penalties incurred by the 
death of the first man; and as by the sin of the first man there has 
been bequeathed to us not only sin, but also death, which is the 
punishment of sin; we must by Christ be delivered from both these 
consequences, both from guilt and from sin (Rom. iv, 12, 17). To show 
to us both effects in Himself, He chose both to die and to rise again; 
to die, to deliver us from sin (Heb. ix, 28); to rise again, to deliver 
us from death (1 Cor. xv, 20) [cf. Rom. iv, 25]. We gather the effect 
of Christ's death in the Sacraments so far as remission of guilt goes: 
at the end of the world we shall gain the effect of Christ's 
resurrection in our deliverance from death.<p> 

But some do not believe in the resurrection of the body; and what is 
said in Scripture on that subject they perversely understand of a 
spiritual resurrection from the death of sin to grace: which error is 
reproved by the Apostle in Hymenaeus and Philetus (2 Tim. ii, 16). 
Moreover the Lord promises both resurrections, when He says: <i>The 
hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the the 
Son of God, and they that hear shall live</i>: which refers to the 
resurrection of souls, then beginning by men beginning to adhere to 
Christ by faith. But presently He makes explicit promise of a bodily 
resurrection: <i>The hour cometh in which all who are in the tombs 
shall hear the voice of the Son of God</i>: for manifestly not souls are 
in the tombs, but bodies.<A HREF="gc4_79a.htm">*</a> Cf. Job xix, 25.<p> 

Reason too gives evident support to the resurrection of the flesh. -- 
1. The souls of men are immortal (B. II, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_79.htm">LXXIX</a>). But the soul is naturally united with the 
body, being essentially the form of the body (B. II, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_57.htm">LVII</a>). Therefore it is against the nature of the 
soul to be without the body. But nothing that is against nature can be 
lasting. Therefore the soul will not be for ever without the body. Thus 
the immortality of the soul seems to require the resurrection of the 
body.<p> 

2. The natural desire of man tends to happiness, or final perfection 
(B. III, Chap. <A HREF="gc3_24.htm">XXIV</a>). Whoever is wanting in 
any point proper to his perfect well-being, has not yet attained to 
perfect happiness: his desire is not yet perfectly laid to rest. Now 
the soul separate from the body is in a sense imperfect, as is every 
part away from its whole, for the soul is part of human nature.<p> 

3. Reward and punishment are due to men both in soul and in body. But 
in this life they cannot attain to the reward of final happiness (B. 
III, Chap. <A HREF="gc3_48.htm">XLVIII</a>); and sins often go 
unpunished in this life: nay, here <i>the wicked live and are comforted 
and set up with riches</i> (Job xxi, 7). There must then be a second 
union of soul with body, that man may be rewarded and punished in body 
and in soul.<A HREF="gc4_79b.htm">*</a>
