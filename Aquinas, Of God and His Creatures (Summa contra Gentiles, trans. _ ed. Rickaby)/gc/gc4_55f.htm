These <i>paenalitates consequentes</i>, as St Thomas
calls them, -- death, suffering, dulness of heart, 
concupiscence, -- are no longer punishments, after 
baptism. The Church has condemned the proposition,
that "all his life long a man ought to do penance
for original sin" (Denzinger, <i>Enchiridion</i>, n, 1176).
