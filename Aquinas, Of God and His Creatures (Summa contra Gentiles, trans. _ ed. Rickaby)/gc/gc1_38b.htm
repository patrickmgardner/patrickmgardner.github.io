"The infinite is inconsistent with any end, while good bears the 
character of an end." It may be urged that end does not bear the same 
sense in both these propositions. In the former it means <i>limit</i> 
(<A HREF="gc1_38b1.htm"><b>peras</b></a>): in the latter it means, 
<i>end in view, the perfection that crowns growth and effort</i> (<A 
HREF="gc1_38b2.htm"><b>telos</b></a>). The answer is that the 
infinite is inconsistent with any end, if infinity has to be traversed 
before that end is reached: for infinity is untraversable.
