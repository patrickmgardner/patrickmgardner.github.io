<H1>That other Subsistent Intelligences cannot be direct Causes of our 
Elections and Volitions<A HREF="gc3_88a.htm">*</a></h1> 

NOR is it to be thought that the souls of the heavens, if any such 
souls there be, or any other separately subsisting created 
intelligences, can directly thrust a volition in upon us, or be the 
cause of our choice. For the actions of all creatures are contained in 
the order of divine providence, and cannot act contrary to the 
conditions of action which providence has laid down.<A 
HREF="gc3_88b.htm">*</a> Now it is a law of providence that everything 
be immediately induced to action by its own proximate cause. But the 
proximate cause of volition is good apprehended by the understanding: 
that is the proper object of the will, and the will is moved by it as 
sight by colour. No subsistent creature therefore can move the will 
except through the medium of good grasped by the understanding. That 
is done by showing it that something is good to do, which is called 
persuasion. No subsistent creature therefore can act upon our will, or 
be the cause of our choice, otherwise than by means of persuasion.<p> 

4. "The violent is that the origin whereof is from without, without the 
subject of violence in any way contributing thereto."<A 
HREF="gc3_88c.htm">*</a> Were then the will to be moved by any 
exterior principle, that motion would be violent. I call that an 
exterior principle of motion, which moves as an efficient cause, and 
not as a final cause. But violence is inconsistent with voluntariness. 
It is impossible therefore for the will to be moved to voluntary action 
by an exterior principle acting as an efficient cause, but every motion 
of the will must proceed from within. Now no subsistent creature is in 
touch with the interior of an intelligent soul: God alone is in such 
close connexion with the soul, as He alone is cause of its being and 
maintains it in existence. Therefore by God alone can a motion of the 
will be efficiently caused.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord: he 
shall turn it whithersoever he will</i> (Prov. xxi, 1); and, <i>God it is 
worketh in us both to will and to accomplish according to his 
good pleasure</i> (Phil. ii, 13).
