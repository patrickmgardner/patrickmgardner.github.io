The theological and devotional terms which we derive from creatures and 
apply to God are not as the Aristotelian <i>homonyma</i>, where, under 
sameness of name, two different senses are expressed of two entirely 
different thing, mere namesakes and nothing more, as when we call a 
<i>post</i> alike a log stuck in the ground and a delivery of letters.
