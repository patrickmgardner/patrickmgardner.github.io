<H1>That by the Sight of God one is Partaker of Life Everlasting</h1>

ETERNITY differs from time in this, that time has being in succession, 
but the being of eternity is all present together. But in the sight of 
God there is no succession: all things that are seen in that vision are 
seen at one glance. That vision therefore is accomplished in a certain 
participation of eternity. That vision also is a certain life: for 
activity of intellect is a life. Therefore by that sight the created 
intelligence is partaker of life everlasting.<p>

4. The intellectual soul is created on the confines of eternity and 
time: because it is last in order of intelligences, and yet its 
substance is raised above corporeal matter, being independent of the 
same. But its action, inasmuch as it touches inferior things that are 
in time, is temporal. Therefore, inasmuch as it touches superior things 
that are above time, its action partakes of eternity. Such is especially 
the vision whereby it sees the divine substance. Therefore by such 
vision it enters into participation of eternity, and sees God in the 
same way as any other created intelligence.<p>

Hence the Lord says: <i>This is life everlasting, to know thee the 
only true God</i> (John xvii, 3).
