<H1>Against the Opinion of Alexander concerning the Potential 
Intellect<A HREF="gc2_62.htm"><A HREF="gc2_62a.htm">*</a></a></h1>

UPON consideration of these words of Aristotle, Alexander determined 
the potential intellect to be some power in us, that so the general 
definition of soul assigned by Aristotle might apply to it. But because 
he could not understand how any subsistent intelligence could be the 
form of a body, he supposed the aforesaid faculty of potential 
intellect not to be planted in any subsistent intelligence, but to be 
the result of some combination of elements in the human body. Thus a 
definite mode of combination of the components of the human body puts a 
man in potentiality to receive the influence of the active intellect, 
which is ever in act, and according to him,<A HREF="gc2_62b.htm">*</a> is a spiritual being 
subsisting apart, under which influence man becomes actually 
intelligent. But that in man whereby he is potentially intelligent is 
the potential intellect: hence it seemed to Alexander to follow that 
the potential intellect in us arises from a definite combination of 
elements. But this statement appears on first inspection to be contrary 
to the words and argument of Aristotle. For Aristotle shows (<i>De 
anima</i>, III, iv, 2-4) that the potential intellect is unmingled with 
the body: but that could not be said of a faculty that was the result 
of a combination of bodily elements. To meet this difficulty Alexander 
says that the potential intellect is precisely the 'predisposition' 
(<i>praeparatio</i>, <b>epit&ecirc;deiot&ecirc;s</b>) which exists in 
human nature to receive the influence of the active intellect; and that 
this 'predisposition' is not any definite sensible nature, nor is it 
mingled with the body, for it is a relation and order between one thing 
and another.<A HREF="gc2_62c.htm">*</a> But this is in manifest disagreement with the mind of 
Aristotle, as the following reasons show:<p>

3. Aristotle assigns these characteristics to the potential intellect: 
to be impressed by the intelligible presentation, to receive 
intelligible impressions, to be in potentiality towards them (<i>De 
anima</i>, III, iv, 11, 12): all which things cannot be said of any 
'disposition,' but only of the subject predisposed. It is therefore 
contrary to the mind of Aristotle, that the mere 'predisposition' 
should be the potential intellect.<A HREF="gc2_62d.htm">*</a><p> 

4. An effect cannot stand higher above the material order than its 
cause. But every cognitive faculty, as such, belongs to the immaterial 
order. Therefore it is impossible for any cognitive faculty to be 
caused by a combination of elements. But the potential intellect is the 
supreme cognitive faculty in us: therefore it is not caused by a 
combination of elements.<p>

6. No bodily organ can possibly have a share in the act of 
understanding. But that act is attributed to the soul, or to the man: 
for we say that the soul understands, or the man through the soul. 
Therefore there must be in man some principle independent of the body, 
to be the principle of such an act. But any predisposition, which is the 
result of a combination of elements, manifestly depends on the body. 
Therefore no such predisposition can be a principle like the potential 
intellect, whereby the soul judges and understands.<p>

But if it is said that the principle of the aforesaid operation in us 
is the intellectual impression actually made by the active intellect, 
this does not seem to suffice: because when man comes to have actual 
intellectual cognition from having had such cognition potentially, he 
needs to understand not merely by some intelligible impression 
actualising his understanding, but likewise by some intellectual 
faculty as the principle of such activity. Besides, an impression is 
not in actual understanding except so far as it is purified from 
particular and material being. But this cannot happen so long as it 
remains in any material faculty, that is to say, in any faculty either 
caused by material principles or actualising a material organ. Therefore 
there must be posited in us some immaterial intellectual faculty, and 
that is the potential intellect.<p>
