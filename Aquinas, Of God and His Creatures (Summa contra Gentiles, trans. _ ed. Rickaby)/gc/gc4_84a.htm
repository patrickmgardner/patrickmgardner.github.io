The risen bodies are not transformed into
spirit, but subjected to the perfect control of the
spirit that animates them. Whereas in mortal man
the soul can go only as far as the body will go, in
the resurrection the body will go as far as the soul
will go, to the utmost limits of its spiritual and
quasi-angelic capacity. The soul (of the just) will then
be delivered <i>from the body of this death</i> (Rom. vii, 24),
inasmuch as the body will no longer hold it back and
bring it down.<p>
