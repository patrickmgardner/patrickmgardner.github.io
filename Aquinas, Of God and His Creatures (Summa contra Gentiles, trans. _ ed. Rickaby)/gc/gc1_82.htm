<H1>Arguments against the aforesaid Doctrine and Solutions of the 
same</h1> 

THESE awkward consequences seem to follow, if any things that God
wills He does not will of necessity.<p>

1. If the will of God in respect of certain objects of will is not 
determined by any of them, it seems to be indifferent.  But every 
faculty that indifferent is in a manner in potentiality.<p> 

2. Since potential being, as such, is naturally changeable, -- for what 
can be can also not be, -- it follows that the divine will is 
variable.<a href="gc1_82a.htm">*</a><p> 

4. Since what hangs loose, indifferent between two alternatives, does not
tend to one rather than to the other, unless it be determined by one or other,
either God wills none of the things to which He is indifferent, or He is
determined by one or other of them, in which case there must be something
antecedent to God to determine Him.<p>

But none of the above objections can stand.<p>

1. The indifference, or indeterminateness, of a faculty may be 
attributable either to the faculty itself or to its object.  To the 
faculty itself, when its indeterminateness comes from its not having 
yet attained to its perfection. This argues imperfection in the 
faculty, and an unfulfilled potentiality, as we see in the mind of a 
doubter, who has not yet attained to premises sufficient to determine 
him to take either of two sides.  To the object of the faculty, when 
the perfect working of the faculty does not depend on its adoption of 
either alternative, and yet either alternative may be adopted, as when 
art may employ different instruments to do the same work equally well. 
This argues no imperfection in the faculty, but rather its pre-eminent 
excellence, inasmuch as it rises superior to both opposing 
alternatives, and therefore is indifferent to both and determined by 
neither.  Such is the position of the divine will with respect to 
things other than itself.  Its perfection depends on none of them; 
being as it is intimately conjoined with its own last end and final 
perfection.<a href="gc1_82b.htm">*</a><p>

2. In the divine will there is no potentiality.  Unnecessitated, it 
prefers one alternative to another respecting the creatures which it 
causes to be. It is not to be looked upon as being in a potential 
attitude to both alternatives, so as first to be potentially willing 
both, and then to be actually willing one.  It is for ever actually 
willing whatever it wills, as well its own self as the creatures which 
are the objects of its causation. But whatever creature God wills to 
exist, that creature stands in no necessary relation to the divine 
goodness, which is the proper object of the divine will.<p>

4. We cannot admit that either the divine will wills none of the 
effects of its causation, or that its volition is determined by some 
exterior object. The proper object of the will is good apprehended as 
such by the understanding. Now the divine understanding apprehends, not 
only the divine being, or divine goodness, but other good things 
likewise (Chap. <a href="gc1_49.htm">XLIX</a>); and it apprehends them 
as likenesses of the divine goodness and essence, not as constituent 
elements of the same.  Thus the divine will tends to them as things 
becoming its goodness, not as things necessary to its goodness. So it 
happens also in our will: which, when it inclines to a thing as 
absolutely necessary to its end, tends to it with a certain necessity; 
but when it tends to a thing solely on account of its comeliness and 
appropriateness, does not tend to it necessarily.
