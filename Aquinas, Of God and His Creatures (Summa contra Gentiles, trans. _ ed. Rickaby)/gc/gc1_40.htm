<H1>That God is the Good of all Good</h1>

GOD in His goodness includes all goodnesses, and thus is the good of 
all good.<P> 

2. God is good by essence: all other beings by participation: therefore 
nothing can be called good except inasmuch as it bears some likeness to 
the divine goodness.  He is therefore the good of all good. Hence it is 
said of the Divine Wisdom: <i>There came to me all good things along 
with it</i> (Wisd. vii, 11).
