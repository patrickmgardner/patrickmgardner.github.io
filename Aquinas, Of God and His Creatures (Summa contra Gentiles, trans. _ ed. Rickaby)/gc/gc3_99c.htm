No, nor the law of physical nature either.
There is no law of physical nature that every harvest
shall ripen. Corn 'tends' to ripeness, and <i>positis 
ponendis</i>, in the absence of all counteracting causes,
must actually ripen. Mill in his <i>Logic</i> has the remark,
that the laws of nature are best expressed as 'tendencies' only.<p>
