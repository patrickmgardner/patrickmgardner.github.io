By <i>abstract</i> here is meant <i>ideal</i>, in the Platonic sense: 
thus <i>ens abstractum</i> answers to <A HREF="gc1_42d1.htm"><b>auto 
to on</b></a>.  It is not abstract in the sense of 
indeterminate: it is not that thinnest of abstractions, being in 
general. It is being, sheer, simple, and full. See Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_25a.htm">XXV note a</a>, <A HREF="gc1_26.htm">XXVI</a>.  In 
fact <i>ens abstractum</i> here is tantamount to <i>ens perfectum</i>: 
cf. the argument about '<i>perfectum bonum</i>, III, Chap. XLVIII, 5.<P> 
But probably this argument is not St Thomas's
at all. It is wanting in the Bergamo autograph in
the Vatican library.
