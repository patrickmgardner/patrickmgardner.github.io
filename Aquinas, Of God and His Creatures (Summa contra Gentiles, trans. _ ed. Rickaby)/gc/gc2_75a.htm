Cf. B&ouml;dder, <i>Psychologia Rationalis</i>, pp. 381-383. No two 
human bodies are perfectly alike, and no two individual men: but it 
remains a question for the curious to consider whether the individual 
peculiarities that distinguish man from man are due to bodily 
conformation merely, or whether there are soul-peculiarities also, a 
peculiar soul being from the first created and infused into a 
correspondingly peculiar body. St Thomas seems to favour the second 
alternative. See Chap. LXXXI, reply to arg. 2, with note.
