Let the compound be <i>Jones graduate</i>.  The compound subsists in the 
state and condition of a graduate: that state and condition is the 
being of the compound.  But the degree itself is identical with the 
state and condition of the graduate.  <i>Jones graduate</i> exists, as 
such, only through the degree.  The degree has no subsistence away from 
<i>Jones graduate</i>, nor <i>Jones graduate</i> away from the degree.
