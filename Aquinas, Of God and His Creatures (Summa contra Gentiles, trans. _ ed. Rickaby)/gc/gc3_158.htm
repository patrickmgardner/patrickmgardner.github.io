<H1>That Man cannot be delivered from Sin except by Grace</h1>

BY mortal sin man is turned away from his last end. And to that last
end he is set on his way only by grace.<p>

2. Offence is removed only by love.<A HREF="gc3_158a.htm">*</a> But by 
mortal sin man quarrels with God: for it is said that God 'hates' 
sinners, inasmuch as He is minded to deprive them of the last end, 
which He has in preparation for them who love Him. Man then cannot rise 
from sin except by grace, whereby friendship is established between God 
and man.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>It is I who blot out thine iniquities for my own 
sake</i> (Isai. xliii, 25).<p>

Hereby is refuted the error of the Pelagians, who said that man can 
rise from sin by free will.
