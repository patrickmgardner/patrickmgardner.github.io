St Thomas here remarks that this comparison,
-- in itself not without difficulty, as it may be pressed
and perverted to an Apollinarist or Eutychian sense,
-- would hold better if Averroes's theory were
tenable, of the unity of all human intellect. On that
theory, as St Thomas points out, "a pre-existent
intellect enters into a new union with a human concept, 
so that out of the two there results one person,
just as we hold that the Word, pre-existent to human
nature, is united to form one person with it." Averroism 
is, perhaps not altogether unconsciously, a
travesty of the Incarnation. For Averroes see B. II,
Chap. <A HREF="gc2_59.htm">LIX</a>.
