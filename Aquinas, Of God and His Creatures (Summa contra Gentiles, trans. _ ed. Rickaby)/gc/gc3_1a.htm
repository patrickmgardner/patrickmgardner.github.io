St Thomas instances "the heavenly bodies, the movements of which 
ever proceed uniformly."  So men from Plato's time to Newton's 
contrasted the vicissitudes of the sublunary world with the 
uniformity of the heavens above.  Newton showed that the same forces 
are at work in the starry heavens as on this earth.  In our day the 
spectroscope has shown that the materials of our earth, or sundry of 
them, enter into the composition of the stars.  The same instrument 
reveals stars still in process of formation, stars even colliding 
and exploding.  There is uniformity in the heavens above and on the 
earth beneath: not more in one than in the other.  The ancients 
under-estimated the regularity and uniformity of nature on earth.  
Their gaze was fixed on catastrophes befalling living creatures and 
man in particular.  Yet even in catastrophes nature is still 
uniform, although working to an effect which we had not expected.  
What crosses our expectations, that we call evil.  But what right 
have we to expect?  Man is not the measure of all things, nor is 
human expectation a law to nature.<p>

The 'heavenly body,' <i>corpus coeleste</i>, built of matter fully 
actuated by its form, and therefore imperishable and unchangeable 
(B. II, Chap. <a href="gc2_30.htm">XXX</a>, n.1, with <a 
href="gc2_30a.htm">note</a>: <i>Sum. Theol.</i> 2-2, q. 24, art. 11, 
corp.), played a great part in the metaphysics and psychology of the 
Middle Ages.  See Chapp. LXXXII-LXXXVII of this Book.  Little did St 
Thomas think that if he could have altered the point of view of his 
eye by some millions of miles, he would have beheld our planet Earth, 
the native region of generation and corruption, turned into a 
<i>corpus coeleste</i>, serenely resplendent as Venus and Mars, 
sweeping out in its orbit with the same accuracy, neither morning 
star nor evening star more wonderful.  Yet the reader of St Thomas 
will find him not altogether credulous of the popular astronomy of 
his time.  He attributes less to the <i>corpus coeleste</i> than 
many of his contemporaries.
