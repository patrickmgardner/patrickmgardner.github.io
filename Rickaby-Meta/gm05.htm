(1) BEING, says St. Thomas,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> is adequately divided by a dichotomy, 
<i>per potentiam et actum</i>; it is either possible or actual. The 
former must be the next subject of our investigation: we must try to 
throw some light on that dark region of which Cicero speaks at the 
opening of his treatise <i>De Fato</i>: "There is an obscure question 
about the possible and the impossible, which the Greek philosophers 
call <b>peri dunat&ocirc;n</b>." For want of a good theology the Greeks 
could make little or nothing out of their inquiry; and the same want 
still shows itself distressingly in some of our modern speculators. 
Consistent disciples in the school of Hume can go no
<!--
THE POSSIBILITIES OF BEING. 167
--><A NAME="p167"></a>
further than man's experience, such as it <i>de facto</i> is; the 
actual for them is the measure of all known possibility, and they 
profess to hold no proposition, which is more than verbal, with the 
assent due to a universal and necessary truth. They teach that all 
which at present we call true might, for anything we can tell, have 
been just the opposite; and why anything is as it is, rather than the 
other way about, lies wholly beyond our power of penetration. We must 
renounce the investigation of origins or ultimate reasons; we must take 
phenomena as we find them, and leave alone all theory as to their 
commencement or endless continuation.<p>
<blockquote>
Vainly does each, as he glides,<br> 
Fable and dream<br>
Of the lands which the river of Time<br>
Had left, ere he woke on its breast,<br>
Or shall reach when his eyes have been closed.<br>
Only the tract where he sails<br>
He wots of; only the thoughts,<br>
Raised by the objects he passes, are his.<br>
For what was before us we know not,<br>
And we know not what shall succeed.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>
Moreover, Hume is worse than merely negative; by his denial of
free-will, he leads directly to fatalism. For from his principles it 
is inferred, not only that man is without freedom, but that the very 
idea involves a self-contradiction; whence it straightway follows that 
nothing could ever be other than it is, and the actual, as it developes 
itself throughout the course of the ages, is the exact
<!--
168 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p168"></a>
measure of the possible. The utmost that Pure Metaphysics can mean 
when it teaches by the mouth of Mill or Huxley, that a square might 
have been elliptical, and that two and two might have made five, is 
that if our universe had been other than it is -- though other it could 
not have been for want of a power to bring about the diversity -- or if 
again our organism had responded differently to its outer environment, 
then on either hypothesis our associated ideas might have fallen into 
this order: "a square is elliptical," "two and two make five."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> 
Regarding the universe as "a closed system," which has nothing outside 
to influence it, the followers of Hume state, by way of purely 
unrealizable hypothesis, that if the parts of the system had been 
otherwise arranged, there is no knowing the limits to which the changes 
in its working might have been carried; any present order might have 
been reversed. Therefore, <i>a priori</i> we can call nothing possible 
rather than impossible; and for us to ask, why it is that some things 
are intrinsically possible and others not, is a most idle inquiry, 
because we never can do more than take these matters as we find them, 
without pretending to fix any ultimate basis.<p>
(2) Next to the pure empiricists who are without a theory as to the 
foundation of possibility, we take those who hold the false theory that 
potentiality, and not actuality, is the origin of all existence. This 
doctrine appears in some of the old cos<!--
THE POSSIBILITIES OP BEING. 169 
--><A NAME="p169"></a>mogonies which start the course of Being from a pure possibility, 
or at any rate, in their uncertain gropings after a philosophy of 
origins, occasionally lay hold of some such explanation. Nor is modern 
speculation wholly above theories of this kind; for we find Hartmann<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> 
laying it down in all seriousness, that "before the world stood forth 
in determinate form there was not anything actual -- anything beyond 
the great motionless, inactive, self-containing <i>Wesen</i> without 
<i>Dasein</i> -- which was Nothing." Now it lies at the root of all 
right conception about Being clearly to perceive, how while in regard 
to secondary existences the possibility precedes the actuality, yet the 
primary existence itself must always have been actual. A potency is not 
an utter non-entity if there is some actuality by which it can be 
reduced to act; but the idea of an original potency, before any 
actuality whatever, is no real idea at all, but a contradiction. To 
Mill's "possibilities of sensation," and "possibilites of conscious 
state," apart from all substance and efficient causality, it is a 
strong objection that they are possibilities stripped of the conditions 
of possibility. Against them is valid the argument which is not valid 
against Aristotle's understanding of <b>en dunamei</b>. In criticism of 
the latter conception Lewes contends "that nothing really exists till 
it exists, and nothing exists possibly, for possibility is only the 
uncertainty of our ignorance." This would have some truth in it if 
there were nothing already actual and 
<!--
170  BEING. 
--><A NAME="p170"></a>
possessed of the power of efficient causality; but it is quite untrue 
as directed against the system of Aristotle. We must, then, hold by the 
doctrine that the source of all possibility is to be finally traced to 
the actual; the opposite conception is irrational.<p>
(3) General Metaphysics borrows from Natural Theology the principles 
which explain the real nature of possibilities: all it has to do on its 
own part is to make a few deductions from these principles. We assume, 
therefore, that the first Being is God, who is one and infinitely 
perfect; who eternally and immutably exists by His own very essence; 
besides whom nothing exists or can exist, except in dependence on Him 
as its Creator out of nothing -- creating not blindly and perforce, but 
with intelligence and free choice. Himself a pure actuality without any 
potentiality -- <i>actus purissimus</i> -- He has yet the active power 
to produce objects other than Himself. How this is to be explained is 
what we have now to declare.<p>
We make a mental but not a real distinction between God's essence, His 
intellect, and His will. Under the terms of this three-fold distinction 
we say that the essence furnishes the primary object to the intellect, 
and the intellect guides the will. Thus God does not will without 
intelligence, nor is His intelligence the arbitrary creator of its own 
truths. The intellect, however, first gives determination to the 
several possibilities in their distinctness; for it would be wildly 
extravagant to regard the Divine essence itself as a sort of 
tesselated or mosaic work, made up of as many independent parts or 
patterns 
<!--
THE POSSIBILITIES OF BEING. 171 
--><A NAME="p171"></a>
as there are independent natures possible in creation. Such a 
monstrous conception would have less sanity in it, than Vacherot's 
saying, <i>Dieu est l'id&eacute;e du monde, et le monde est la 
realit&eacute; de Dieu</i>. The fact is that God, contemplating His own 
essence, sees it not only as it is in itself, but also as it dictates 
the law to all possibility outside itself. Consequently, what is 
possible will always be a rational object to thought;<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> what is 
impossible will always be irrational or self-contradictory. The
self-contradictory is a non-entity, and hence the impossible is no 
limit on the Divine power. To declare simply that a square circle 
cannot be, because it is beyond the power of omnipotence, leaves 
unexplained how this is not a denial of omnipotence; but to say that a 
square circle is nothing, shows how there is no such denial.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup><p>
Thus, then, we have settled what is the ultimate determinant of 
possibility: we must throw further light on the doctrine by 
distinguishing between <i>intrinsic</i> and <i>extrinsic</i> 
possibility. It is the intrinsically possible that our explanation has 
so far been concerned with; and we have seen it to be any positive 
object the conception of which includes no contradiction, no inner 
repugnance of character, such as is found in "a learned
carriage-wheel."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> 
<!--
172 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p172"></a>
Extrinsic possibility is the power possessed by something else to 
actualize that which is intrinsically possible. In reference to created 
forces, many things intrinsically possible are extrinsically 
impossible; but in reference to God's omnipotence, just because it is 
omnipotence, the extrinsically possible is co-extensive with the 
intrinsically possible. Because, however, what singly involves no 
repugnance may in conjunction with certain circumstances present 
contradictions, therefore we have the class of <i>incompossibilia</i>, 
or things possible separately but not conjointly. God cannot arrange 
the order of His Providence so as to put before man good and evil, 
between which to choose, and at the same time take the choice of evil 
quite out of human power. God cannot retreat from His promise once 
unconditionally given; neither can He literally undo the past, though 
often He may repair it:<p>
<blockquote>
<b>monou gar autou kai Theos sterisketai,<br>
agen&ecirc;ta poiein hass an &ecirc; pepragmena.</b>
</blockquote><p>
God, again, cannot Himself, and in His own Divine Nature, elicit those 
acts which are essentially immanent in a finite and imperfect nature: 
He cannot vegetate, or have sensations, or make new discoveries, or 
show courage in the arduous pursuit of virtue, or nobly apologize for a 
mistake.<p>
<i>A propos</i> of mistakes, we are liable to them in the case of 
ambiguous words; and therefore it will not be without its utility, as a 
caution, to point out how the above description of "possible," whether 
as intrinsic or as extrinsic, differs from another use of 
<!--
THE POSSIBILITIES OF BEING. 173 
--><A NAME="p173"></a>
the "possible," whereby it signifies the "probable." A person may say 
to his friend, who ought to have sailed for America a month ago, but 
perhaps did not, "Possibly he is yet in England." Now if the man really 
has landed in the New World, and has remained there, it is not 
"possible" that he should still be in England except in the sense of 
"probable," to one who is left to mere conjecture. Probability is a 
calculation made partly according to our knowledge, but partly also 
according to our ignorance; hence the probable need not be true, or 
even possible in the strict sense. (Our doctrine may now be summarized 
in scholastic phraseology. The possibilities of things are all derived 
from God, the first Actuality: they are in His essence 
<i>fundamentaliter</i>, and <i>eminenter</i>: they are in His intellect 
<i>formaliter</i>, they are in His will, so far as He wills them, 
<i>executive</i>, though the complete accuracy of the last adverb 
depends on whether we make a distinction between God's will and His 
omnipotence or Almighty power, as efficient cause.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>
Pure empiricists and some others will object to such doctrine that it 
labours under the inborn vice of all Metaphysics, the presumption of 
settling, by <i>a priori</i> method, which can be settled either by 
experience only, or not at all.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> We fully allow that in the concrete 
and in particular instances we can determine the possibilities of 
things in no other way than by observing their activities. But our 
problem
<!--
174 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p174"></a>
has not been to settle a single determinate thing as either possible 
or impossible: all we have sought to discover is the great root of 
every finite possibility, and we are quite indifferent whether it be 
this or that. Not one statement of physical science have we pretended 
to settle <i>a priori</i>, our inquiry has been wholly metaphysical; it 
has been the inquiry into <i>Whence is possibility?</i> not into 
<i>What things are possible?</i> For our investigation we required to 
know, but did not assume as known <i>a priori</i>, God's relation to 
finite objects: we borrowed that knowledge from a treatise which makes 
it matter of laborious proof. That relation once understood, our task 
became one of simple deduction from the given principles; in the course 
of which work we have not violated, but merely have not come across the 
vaunted principle of the <i>novum organon</i>: "Man, as nature's 
minister and interpreter, can do and understand only so much as he has 
observed in nature; beyond this he can do and understand nothing."<p>
Lest our teaching should be thought to be exclusively scholastic, we 
will give a specimen of the same doctrine as delivered by the mouth of 
a professor who thought scholasticism a fetter upon the freedom of 
intellect : "From Plato to Leibnitz," says Cousin,<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> "the greatest 
metaphysicians have held that Absolute Truth is the attribute of the 
Absolute Being. Investigate nature, ascend to the laws which govern it, 
and which make it, so to speak, a living truth; the deeper you dive 
into these laws, the nearer you approach to God." And from
<!--
THE POSSIBILITIES OF BEING. 175 
--><A NAME="p175"></a>
Leibnitz he takes the words: "It is asked, Where would these ideas be, 
if there existed no spirit to give to them a solid and sure foundation 
as eternal truths? Thus you are led to the ultimate ground of all 
truth, to the Sovereign Spirit that cannot but exist, in whose 
intelligence the eternal truths have their abode, after the manner 
which St. Augustine has vividly described. Lest, however, it should be 
fancied that there is no need to have recourse to such an origin, be it 
observed that these necessary truths contain the determining plan and 
the regulative principle of existent things themselves; in a word, 
they give the laws of the universe. It follows that, since they are 
prior to the existence of contingent natures, they must have had their 
foundation in some necessarily existing substance." The importance to 
philosophy of this doctrine about the origin of possibilities is very 
great; and a reference to the above principles will often clear up a 
perplexity, shedding light where else hopeless obscurity would prevail. 
To have fully established even that possibilities do not account for 
themselves, but need some real foundation, is a great step; it lands on 
firm ground for future progress. Henceforth we adhere closely to the 
truths that possibilities differ from nothing, in the blankest sense of 
the word; and that they already possess a virtual existence in the 
power of the agents that can bring them into actuality, and in the 
intrinsic actuability of their own nature.<p>
(4) There is an author who admits the ordinary scholastic view about 
God's primacy in the order 
<!--
176 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p176"></a>
of existences, and yet so innovates upon the usual deductions 
therefrom, that his error will serve to emphasize the true conclusions 
in a matter of the greatest moment. Perhaps not without some connexion 
with his confusion between <i>assent</i> of the judgment and 
<i>consent</i> of the will, whereby he regarded affirmation and 
negation as acts of the latter faculty, Descartes asserted that 
ultimate possibilities depended on the free choice of God, to such an 
extent that another determination on His part might have made the 
opposites of all our present necessary truths to be true. In his 
<i>R&eacute;ponses aux Objections</i>, n. 8, Descartes argues that God, 
who cannot but choose the best, would not have been free to create, if 
the possibilities of creation had presented degrees of perfection, 
antecedently to the settlement, by God's arbitrary decision, of what is 
good and what is less good or bad. "For if any element of good had 
shown itself prior to God's determination of what was to be, it would 
undoubtedly have moved Him to do what was best.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> But the fact is the 
other way about; because God has decreed to make the things which are 
in the world, therefore it is said in Genesis, 'They are very good;' 
in other words, the reason of their goodness rests on the Divine will 
to have made them what they are. It is useless for us to vex ourselves 
with the question whether God from eternity could have settled that 
twice four should not be eight; for I allow, this passes  
<!--
THE POSSIBILITIES OF BEING. 177
--><A NAME="p177"></a>
our comprehension; but as on the other side I understand very well 
that nothing of any sort can exist which does not depend upon God, and 
that He could easily have arranged things so that man could conceive no 
other arrangement possible; it is quite contrary to reason to doubt 
about what we fully understand, because of something else which we do 
not understand, and which, though we may fail to see the fact, it was 
not likely that we should understand. Thus, then, the eternal truths 
depend only on God's will; they are as the Supreme Lawgiver has from 
eternity determined that they should be." So teaches Descartes on a 
most vital question. The ruinous consequence of his system is that he 
has left himself without any fixed point on which truth or goodness may 
rest. If the true and the good are simply what God settles they are to 
be, and His settlement is quite arbitrary, with no ground for choice on 
one side rather than on another, what becomes of God's own essential 
truth and goodness? Why cannot He have decreed that lying is good, and 
have made His own revelation accordingly? Why may He not make us the 
sport of perpetual delusion? What if He had ordained that religion 
should consist in blaspheming Himself, and that to reverence Him should 
be the very depth of wickedness? What becomes of that indispensable 
element in every philosophy which is at all tenable -- a basis of 
absolutely fixed principles? Descartes simply subverts all reason by 
pretending to ground truth ultimately on an indifferent choice between 
what is to be truth and what is to be falsehood, without 
<!--
178 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p178"></a>
any prior claim of one side over the other. An appreciation of the 
ruinous result will inspire a greater esteem for the common doctrine of 
the schoolmen in regard to the necessary, immutable character of all 
ultimate possibilities. These are necessary and immutable with God's 
own necessity and immutability. Of previous writers, Descartes might 
have singled out Ockam,<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> to lend some countenance to his views -- a 
service which that author would have rendered by neglecting to find a 
foundation for intrinsic, as distinguished from extrinsic possibility, 
and by simply referring possibility to Divine Omnipotence. But Ockam is 
an author who could not be appealed to with much effect, because of 
his notorious defects; and his failure to pay proper attention to the 
intrinsic possibility was just the omission of a point which is of 
capital importance in the whole question. Intrinsic possibility is a 
reality that needs accounting for after a manner quite. as rational as 
is the manner of account which we render for extrinsic: it cannot be 
taken for a mere nothing, nor yet, as Wolf takes it, for a sort of 
self-settled law, which still would hold though God ceased to exist. If 
it had this independent validity, then God in creation would have been 
obliged to work by a strictly limiting rule, which had no origin in 
Himself, and to which He would therefore be in literal subjection. 
But, it may be asked, is not God somehow so subject? for by what are 
the possibilities of His own nature 
<!--
THE POSSIBILITIES OF BEING. 179 
--><A NAME="p179"></a>
determined, if not by some necessity, at least logically prior to His 
own existence? There is no such priority, for in God there is no 
potentiality; and if ever we speak of the possibility of the Divine 
nature, as legitimately we may,<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> it cannot be in the full sense that 
is applicable to all things else, which come under the rule <i>prius 
est posse esse quam esse</i> -- "<i>to be possible</i> comes before 
<i>to be</i>." God gives the law to all things possible, and thereby 
makes them subordinate: but He cannot fall under the same law so as to 
be subordinate to Himself. Should any one try here to puzzle us by 
bringing in the principle of excluded middle, "God either is possible 
or He is not possible," we choose the second horn of the dilemma, 
provided we are allowed to explain, that "possible," according to the 
use of it supposed by the objector, is taken to include the idea of 
past or present potentiality, and that its contradictory, "not possible 
is different from "impossible." God therefore is "not possible" in the 
sense that He is above the conditions of potentiality. The only way in 
which we should be likely to need the phrase, "God is possible," would 
be as the conclusion of an argument to prove, that an infinite,
self-existent Being, One, intelligent, and Supreme over all things, is 
not a self-repugnant notion. But even this inference has to be drawn 
from the proved fact of God's existence, not from an <i>a priori</i> 
consideration of the several  
<!--
180 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p180"></a>
ideas involved in the description of the Divine nature; and when we 
thus declare God to be <i>possible</i>, no potentiality is involved. 
The term has reference only to the clearing away of the human error, 
that a God, such as Theism asserts, <i>cannot be</i>; we refute the 
<i>cannot be</i> by establishing <i>the possibility</i>.<p>
In explanation of a mistake like that of Ockam, we may consider the 
kindred mistake of Storchenau,<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> who says, "Even on the hypothesis 
that God did not exist, propositions of the following kind would remain 
valid, 'There is no contradiction between the essential notes of such 
and such an object;' 'Things would still have their internal 
possibility.'" A common but very misleading fallacy is here detectable. 
It is right to affirm that one who had not yet admitted God's existence 
might recognize certain necessary truths as self-evidently necessary: 
he might be sure about some intrinsic possibilities or impossibilities. 
But observe the vast difference between the two propositions: "Without 
a previous recognition of God, the mind can recognize a certain truth:" 
and, "On the hypothesis that no God existed, a certain truth would 
still remain true." Surely it is one thing to say, "A building may be 
proved to be stable, though its foundations have not been explored," 
and another to say, "That building would remain stable though its 
foundations were removed."<p>
(6) In Pure Logic some authors recognize only four "modals," 
possibility and impossibility, neces<!--
THE POSSIBILITIES OF BEING. 181 
--><A NAME="p181"></a>sity and contingency: wherein we have a sufficient reminder, after 
treating of possible Being, to add a few words about Being regarded as 
necessary and contingent. Already in <i>First Principles</i><sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> we had 
much to say about necessity; now in Ontology we must return to the 
idea. We take it as established that God is the primal, absolutely 
necessary Being; all other beings, as they depend for their creation on 
His free choice, are contingent, existing as matters of fact, whereas 
they need not have existed. Besides absolute necessity there is a lower 
grade of necessity, following on a hypothesis. It is at least running a 
great risk of false doctrine when hypothetical necessity is made the 
only kind to which the term necessity should be given. Yet we find Mr. 
F. Bradley<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> writing thus: "It is easy to give the general sense in 
which we use the term <i>necessity</i>. A thing is necessary if it be 
taken not simply in and by itself, but by virtue of something else and 
because of something else. Necessity carries with it the idea of 
mediation, of dependency, of inadequacy to maintain an isolated 
position and to stand and act alone and self-supported. A thing is not 
necessary when it simply is: it is necessary when it is, or is said to 
be, because of something else." Thus the absolute Being of God would be 
the one negation of necessity, for He alone of all Beings is not 
"because of something else." Afterwards Mr. Bradley excludes the term 
necessity from the region of reality.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> "Reality in itself is neither 
necessary, nor possible, nor again impossible. These predicates 
<!--
182 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p182"></a>
(we must suppose in Logic) are not found as such outside our 
reflexion. And to a knowledge and reflexion that had command of the 
facts nothing would ever appear <i>possible</i>. The real would seem 
necessary, the unreal would seem impossible." However, leaving the 
real, and keeping strictly to the logical,<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> "in logic we find that a 
necessary truth is really an inference, and an inference is nothing but 
a necessary truth." Lotze again is one who has set the example of 
limiting the term necessary to mental processes<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> "Necessity, if not 
confined to a necessity of thought on our part, but extended to that 
which is expressly held to be the unconditioned condition of all that 
is conditioned would have simply no assignable meaning, and would have 
to be replaced by the notion of a <i>de facto</i> universal validity." 
The tremendous issues that turn on the idea "necessity," must be our 
justification for yet further illustrations showing how different is 
the sense in which it is admitted by some nonscholastic authors from 
the meaning given to it by scholastics. Mr. Bosanquet<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> affirms that 
"absolute 
<!--
THE POSSIBILITIES OF BEING. 183 
--><A NAME="p183"></a>
necessity is a <i>contradiction in adjecto</i>, because all necessity 
is <i>ex hypothesi</i> conditional." As was to be expected, a similar 
change is made in the word "free," which no longer stands for the 
liberty of election that we conceive to be the meaning of the term. The 
mind is said to be a "free agent," because it is not one of the 
phenomenal relations that go to make up nature; it distinguishes itself 
from them, and is their producer, not their product. For example, Green 
tells us in his <i>Prolegomena Ethica</i>, "Those relations which we 
are apt to treat as independent entities under the name of matter and 
motion, are relations existing for a consciousness, <i>which they do 
not so condition, as that it should itself either move or be 
material</i>;" man has "freedom of <i>intelligence</i>," "as 
<i>knowing</i> he is a free cause." Again he insists, with regard to 
intellect, "The agent must act absolutely from itself in the action 
through which the world is -- not, as does everything else in the 
world, under determination by something else. The world has no 
character but that given to it by this action. <i>This is what we mean 
by calling the agent a free cause</i>. Our action <i>in knowtedge</i>
-- the action by which we connect successive phenomena in the unity of 
a related whole -- is an action absolutely from itself, as little to be 
accounted for by the phenomena which through it become intelligent 
experience, or by anything alien to itself, as that which we have found 
to be implied in the existence of the universal order." We, on the 
other hand, teach that the ground indeed of freedom is in man's natural 
knowledge, but that only the will is free. 
<!--
184 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p184"></a>
That there exist these great differences in the use of terms between 
our adversaries and ourselves, it is most important distinctly to 
observe, lest mutual misunderstandings should go on indefinitely 
increasing. It is not, however, needful that we here should try further 
to investigate the enemy's position. From the principles which we have 
already laid down in explaining possible Being, we will proceed very 
briefly but clearly to draw out our own account of necessary Being, 
leaving for Natural Theology the deeper development of that notion.<p>
We affirm, then, that in Ontology the phrase "necessary Being" has a 
distinct and evidently valid meaning. It stands primarily to designate 
the Being of God, the only Being that is quite necessary in the order 
of existence. His existence or non-existence was never a matter of 
contingency. He unconditionally, absolutely must be, not because of any 
extrinsic reason, but because of His own intrinsic nature. The 
necessity so predicated of God is eminently a real characteristic, and 
a very important one: no other first principle of Being is rationally 
conceivable than the Supremely Necessary Being.<p>
The second sort of necessity is a consequent necessity: a necessity 
following only upon the verification of some hypothesis. Thus there is 
a physical necessity in the sequence of natural phenomena, given that a 
certain number of elements have been created, with definite laws of 
action, and with definite positions relatively to each other in space. 
It is not free to such combinations to do otherwise 
<!--
THE POSSIBILITIES OF BEING. 185
--><A NAME="p185"></a>
than they do: there is no contingency in the results after the 
conditions have been posited.<p>
Contingent, as opposed to necessary, does not require freedom in the 
object that is called contingent, but it does imply freedom somewhere 
or other. Any part of the material universe is contingent, inasmuch as 
it is not of the very essence of such a collection of substances and 
forces to exist: the ultimate determinant of its existence, as opposed 
to its non-existence, was the free-will of the Creator.<p>
The above doctrines about Necessity and Contingency in Being are 
obvious enough on our principles: they are hardly contested' within 
systems of philosophy that agree substantially with ours: but 
differences do arise when we meet with men who utterly disagree with 
our theory of knowledge and of reality. It cannot, therefore, be too 
carefully remarked that our view of the nature of intellect, and of its 
power to know things in themselves, which are quite other than our own 
conscious selves, is decisive of our position in matters of 
Ontology.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup><p>
(7) A useful addition may here be made to the account which we gave in 
a previous chapter about essence: for the matters which we have just 
been explaining enable us to say, what we were not prepared to say 
before, how it is that even finite 
<!--
186 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p186"></a>
essences are sometimes described to be eternal, necessary, and 
immutable. Clearly the meaning is not that any created nature
eternally and necessarily exists, or that the scholastic teaching 
about essential, substantial changes, is revoked by the assertion of 
immutability in all essences. It is of essences considered in the 
region of possibility, or in their intrinsic, metaphysical character, 
apart from the contingent facts of their actual, physical, concrete 
existence, that eternity, necessity, and immutability are predicated. 
In other words, the doctrine is about the <i>ens essentiae</i> as 
explained in the first chapter. An actual essence of the created order, 
though not eternal or necessary, may be called immutable in the sense 
that, as such, it cannot be changed without ceasing to be the 
particular essence it is, and giving place to some other; it is, 
however, mutable, inasmuch as its accidents may vary.<p>
NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.<p>
(1) In the same way that we find the ancients puzzling their heads over 
Being, we find them also inventing almost unintelligible subtleties 
about Possibility. The Stoics, who ought in consistency to have limited 
the possible to what, at some time or other, becomes actual, 
nevertheless tried, as we see in the teaching of Chrysippus, to 
reconcile with their doctrine of fatalistic necessity, a belief in some 
possibilities that are never actualized<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> -- more especially a belief 
that the evil-doer among men is responsible for not acting other<!--
THE POSSIBILITIES OF BEING 187 
--><A NAME="p187"></a>wise than he does. The Megarics again were philosophers who got 
themselves entangled in some very awkward mazes; a specimen of which we 
have in the obscure argument called <b>kurieu&ocirc;n</b>, and invented 
by Diodorus. It rests on the assertion that the three following 
propositions cannot be held consistently together: (i.) "From the 
possible there never follows the impossible:" (ii.) What has happened 
in the past cannot be other than it has been:" (iii.) "Something is 
possible which neither has been nor will be actualized." While 
Chrysippus denied the first of the three, Diodorus deduced the 
falsehood of the third from the other two, which he admitted. His 
argument was:<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> "From anything possible nothing impossible can result; 
but it is impossible that the past can be different from what it is; 
for had it been possible at a past moment, something impossible would 
have resulted from something possible. It was, therefore, never 
possible; and generally speaking it is impossible that anything should 
happen different to what has happened." The reader need not rack his 
brain over this sophism; but there may be some to whom this little 
historic fragment has an interest of some kind or other.<p>
(2) The bearings of our theory of possibility on the proposition that 
"every Being is true," as also on the idealistic theory, that the truth 
of all the reality in the universe is constituted by conscious mind, 
are very close; for we make the possible and the intelligible 
essentially coincident. This view is largely insisted upon by 
philosophers of different schools, as for example, by Cudworth: "The 
entity of all theoretical truth is nothing else but clear 
intelligibility, and whatever is clearly conceived is an entity and a 
truth: but that which is false Divine power itself cannot make to 
<!--
188 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p188"></a>
be clearly and distinctly understood."<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> Reid indeed quotes and 
criticizes unfavourably the doctrine: but after adducing other authors 
who speak in the like sense, he remarks,<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> that he had "never found one 
that called it in question." Of course it is easy enough to make 
pretence at conceiving the impossible, but the terms of the conception 
will never be united in thought. All that we are concerned to defend 
is, that every possible object is, of its own nature, conceivable, and 
that no really conceivable object is impossible, though we may by 
abstraction conceive only a portion of it, which by itself alone, 
without other portion or portions, could not exist.<p>
(3) In the case of free agents we come across a special sort of 
impossibility, called "moral impossibility;" on which, though the 
action might absolutely be done, the difficulty of doing it is so great 
that we cannot expect it to be done. For example, there is a degree of 
attention to one's occupation which could not be justly exacted, not 
because it could not be reached by an extraordinary effort, but because 
it is beyond what is possible by ordinary effort; and ordinary effort, 
as we will suppose, is all that the gravity of the case demands. Of 
moral impossibilities some approach nearer, some less near, to absolute 
impossibility: if they reach absolute impossibility, then they become 
likewise physical impossibilities. For example, that an ordinary 
Christian should say frequent prayers, and never for a whole year have 
a distraction, is an impossibility at once moral and physical. In these 
matters, however, the use of words is not uniform: and we should not be 
too ready to condemn another man's expressions till we have made sure 
of their meaning, or of their want of clear meaning.<p>
