PREFACE.<p>
(1) THERE is in England a plain-spoken proverb which says, "Give a dog 
a bad name and hang him;" and there is, moreover, in England a bad name 
attaching to Metaphysics, with the result that our countrymen incline 
to treat that science after the manner in which they would treat the 
dog under a similar imputation. The ill-fame is in part due to 
ignorance, which not in every case produces the aggrandizing effect 
expressed by the words <i>Omne ignotum pro magnifico</i>, but 
sometimes, as in the present instance, acts in the contrary way, and 
has the vilifying effect signified in the adage, "Ignorance is the 
mother of prejudice." Metaphysics are supposed by the ignorant to be 
essentially what many writers have made them to be by abuse -- a wild 
dance of unintelligible speculations in the air. Again, there is a 
prejudice against them because no immediate results in pounds, 
shillings, and pence come of Metaphysics. Not only is it that a book 
<!--
vi PREFACE. 
--><A NAME="_"></a>
published on the subject brings in no large returns to the author, but 
the science itself contrasts unfavourably with many branches of 
physical science, which, so far at least as concerns material comforts, 
have done very much, in recent generations, to make our earth a more 
desirable place of habitation than it used to be.<p>
In reply it has to be answered that Metaphysics certainly need not 
extravagate into meaningless jargon: for, dealing with notions that 
enter into every sentence which we intelligibly utter, the science is 
quite able to single out these fundamental ideas and to explain their 
rational significance. Next, we answer that, though Metaphysics do not 
serve the uses that are not proper to their nature, yet they do serve 
even nobler uses than those of material comfort, and form in themselves 
a worthy end of pursuit -- not, of course, man's ultimate and adequate 
end, but still a good end. It was the great work of Socrates to go 
about questioning people as to what they meant by the generalized terms 
in constant use among them, and to show them that they needed to make 
their notions much more precise; no one can deny that this was a worthy 
occupation for the life of a philosopher.<p>
(2) From the student of General Metaphysics no great genius is 
necessarily demanded, but only 
<!--
PREFACE. vii 
--><A NAME="_"></a>
that he should be a steady worker -- one who thinks often and 
patiently, who takes pains to be clear to himself, and who does not 
rest till he has acquired an easy familiarity in dealing with the most 
abstract and most general of human conceptions. The meanings which he 
must affix to terms are substantially matters settled by the very 
nature of the case, yet not so that no room is left for free 
arrangement. When, however, a convention has been fixed upon, care 
should be taken not to forget the fact. To be thoroughly at home with 
the whole phraseology, both conventional and otherwise, as it is one of 
the great difficulties of the study, so also is it one of the prime 
requisites. The bewilderment that disheartens the Metaphysician in his 
early struggles is comparable to that of a stranger in a house with 
many rooms, passages, and landings; to move about easily in such a 
place is a matter of habituation. Not sublime intellect, but repeated 
traversings of the several departments, with an attentive eye to notice 
their exact forms and their mutual bearings -- these are the means to 
be employed. Think often, think clearly, think connectedly: here is the 
motto for a beginner in Metaphysics.<p>
While insisting that a Metaphysician need not be a genius, but should 
be a patient, plodding thinker, who makes sure of each step as he 
proceeds, 
<!--
viii PREFACE. 
--><A NAME="_"></a>
we may add that not unfrequently mischief befalls genius misdirected 
where mediocrity would have been safe. Hume, Kant, and Reid have 
concurred in expressing the judgment that the creative imagination of 
the genius may be a great snare to him when he is dealing with 
philosophy; so that it is not enough to urge, in answer to the very 
severe condemnation of some systems, that their authors have been 
exceedingly clever men. All the worse that they were clever, if it was 
cleverness misapplied; many a work fails because "it is too clever by 
half."<p>
(3) In appreciating the magnitude of the task before us, there are two 
opposite extremes to be avoided: one is to suppose that the notions 
with which we have to deal are so simple as to require no study, and 
that they can be confused only by a preposterous attempt to force them 
into a long scientific system, such as a text-book on Metaphysics 
displays; and the other is to imagine that the notions are so minute, 
so fluxional and evanescent, as to defy anything like fixity of 
signification. The fact is, the ideas are simple, and carry along with 
their simplicity some of its greatest difficulties. As a man may have 
"the faults of his virtues," so a study may have the difficulties of 
its easiness. Nor do Metaphysics stand alone in the enforcement 
<!--
PREFACE. ix 
--><A NAME="_"></a>
of the lesson that it is hard to be simple, that there is much art in 
simplicity.<p>
As all the notions we have to deal with are so elementary, it will not 
be surprising that often in the explanation of them the larger part of 
the discourse goes to setting aside misconceptions, and that when these 
have been removed, comparatively little space is required for the 
statement of the true doctrine. The importance of the positive teaching 
must not be judged by the proportion of the words devoted to it, but 
rather by its own intrinsic merit. In the early days of French juries 
it is reported that the instruction had to be given to them, that they 
must weigh witnesses rather than count them; and the same is true of 
the paragraphs in a book, especially if that book is about "First 
Philosophy," where most of the terms to be expounded are too simple to 
admit of definition, and most of the propositions to be defended are 
too self-evident to allow of demonstration by principles more 
fundamental than themselves. In these cases, to clear away false 
impressions is often the larger part of the task which lies before one 
who would carry home to his readers a conviction of the truth.<p>
