<i>Notes and Illustrations.</i></ul><p>
(1) <i>Essentia</i> is not a word which we find in a select Latin 
Dictionary that contains only the most approved vocables of the 
classical period; but it certainly had its own period of high repute in 
the flourishing days of scholasticism, and even now, according to 
Martinus Scriblerus, it is faring better than most of its kind. "For," 
he says, "instead of being, like them, quite abolished, it has suivived 
in the chemists' shops, where it has even been raised to the rank of a 
quintessence." Ridicule, however, does not always kill; and we are 
going to show that the term "essence" is still alive, and must continue 
to live, if science is to have any life in it. The word has a wider and 
a narrower signification, each of which we have to examine. 
<!--
60 BEING.  
--><A NAME="p60"></a><p>
It is asserted to be the prerogative of intellect proper, that it knows 
all its objects under the aspect of essences; and this its power is 
made a strongly distinguishing mark between the perception which is 
characteristically human and mere animal perception. A writer who was 
no schoolman, Lewes, more than once falls back on this distinction; 
saying, for instance, that "the animal thinks, but only in sensations 
and images, not in abstractions and symbols. The animal perceives no 
<i>object</i>, no <i>causal counexion</i>," that is, nothing as 
<i>object</i>, or as <i>causal connexion</i>; and this deficiency comes 
from want of the faculty to apprehend the <i>whatness</i> of things. 
Here is a virtual recognition of the broadest meaning of the word 
essence, though this is not the term which Lewes himself would have 
used to express his opinion. Still his doctrine, which is accepted in 
the recent work of Mr. Romanes, so far as it is true, implies that no 
animal can ask or answer the question, <i>What?</i> Man, on the 
contrary, even though uncultured, is ever employed on the investigation 
of the <i>what</i> in things, and his conceptions, however inadequate, 
take the form of a <i>quiddity</i> or <i>essence</i>. Substantially, at 
all events, he understands the force of the interrogative pronoun 
<i>quid</i>. Hence the lines of Hudibras have some truth:<p>
<blockquote>
He knew what's what, and that's as deep<br>
As metaphysic wit can peep.  
</blockquote><p>
As a specimen of the scholastic teaching, the words of Father Lahousse 
will suffice: "Essence is the
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 61
--><A NAME="p61"></a>
formal object of the intellectual act; for the intellect expresses all 
that it apprehends by terms in which it conceives other objects of a 
like sort, such terms, for example, as <i>substance</i> and 
<i>accident</i>, <i>spirit</i> and <i>body</i>, <i>infinite</i> and 
<i>finite</i>, <i>existent</i> and <i>non-existent</i>, <i>singular</i> 
and <i>universal</i>, <i>present</i> and <i>absent</i>. Now whoever 
apprehends that whereby a thing is placed in a certain definite order, 
apprehends an <i>essence</i>." So much for the meaning of 
<i>essence</i> in the widest sense, according to which <i>Being</i> is 
the most generalized essence: every object is a Being so far as in 
answer to question, What is it? the intellect must reply, It is a 
<i>something</i>, an <i>Ens essentiae</i>.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup><p>
(2) Up to the present point our doctrine will probably not provoke many 
dissentients, though really it does involve the assertion of a 
thorough-going difference between sense and intellect, such as the 
school of Hume flatly deny. Openly, the tug of war begins over our next 
claim, which involves higher pretensions to the knowledge of essences. 
The schoolmen held firmly, that those objects which they called 
<i>natural</i>, as distinguished from <i>artificial</i> objects -- a 
distinction which they must have felt they could not always draw with 
precision -- were not mere aggregates of cohering elements, but 
essences, each constituted strictly a unit by an indivisible 
substantial form: for it was only some writers who allowed the 
possibility of two or more substantial forms superposed one on another. 
How far the scholastic doctrine is demonstrable is discussed in 
<i>Cosmology</i>. Here it suffices to prove 
<!--
62 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p62"></a>
that we can, more or less, reach the essential constitution of a 
number of things -- find that which, as <i>essentia</i>, gives them 
their <i>esse</i> after the way in which a man's <i>sapientia</i> gives 
him his <i>sapere</i>. Where we cannot absolutely touch the goal, at 
least we can make approximations.<p>
(a) Attacks upon our present position may be divided into three 
possible degrees. (i.) The fact of essence may be granted, but all 
further knowledge of it denied; (ii.) the fact may be declared 
doubtful; (iii.) the so-called fact may be pronounced a fiction of the 
mind. To borrow an illustration from the hidden personality of an 
Oriental monarch, who sometimes holds himself aloof from his people as 
the great, mysterious power in the background, we may find these three 
corresponding stages of belief and disbelief. One subject of the prince 
might say, "There is such a potentate, but that is all I know;" 
another, "I doubt whether there is such a potentate;" a third, "Such 
potentate certainly does not exist, and those styled his Ministers are 
our real and only rulers."<p>
The three modes of attack are actually made, and we certainly shall not 
understand the important question of essences if we are too idle to go 
through the successive stages of the controversy. Adversaries shall 
state their own case, and we will reply.<p>
(1) Hobbes<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> had made the sarcastic remark that "quiddity" was one of 
the words which God had not taught Adam in Paradise; but to Locke 
especially is traced the origin of the great revolution
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 63 
--><A NAME="p63"></a>
against the reign of essences. In praise of Locke, Voltaire says, "He 
alone has marked out the development of the human mind, in a book where 
there is nothing but truth, and, what makes the work perfect, every 
truth is clearly set forth." To this general commendation Mill has 
added his special approval in regard to the doctrine of essences:<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> 
"It was reserved for Locke to convince philosophers, that the supposed 
essences were merely the significations of their names; nor among the 
signal services which this writer rendered to philosophy was there one 
more needful or more valuable." Accordingly Mill teaches that 
definition can only be of names, not of real essences. Evidently, then, 
it is our duty to acquaint ourselves with Locke's doctrine, and to see 
whether we can accept Mill's judgment on its value. If we like to take 
the teaching first of all at second hand, we have it in the 
commendatory words of Reid, who makes the view his own:<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> "The works of 
God are all imperfectly known by us. We see their outside or perhaps we 
discover some of their qualities and relations, by observation and 
experiment, assisted by reason; but we can give no definition of the 
meanest of them, which comprehends its real essence. It is justly 
observed by Locke, that nominal essences only, which are the creatures 
of our own minds, are perfectly apprehended by us; and even of these 
there are many too simple in their nature to admit  
<!--
64 BEING.
--><A NAME="p64"></a>
of definition." The reference which we give to the author himself 
bears out the above compendium of his doctrine, which explicitly is 
that "the essences of things are nothing else but our abstract ideas." 
Thus Locke grants that things have essences -- "real essences:" what 
he denies is, that we can know anything more than the "nominal 
essences," which Hamilton<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> says is only another phrase for "logical 
essences," or "the abstract notions worked out by general terms." In 
other words, Locke is here a nominalist or a conceptualist in his 
denial of reality to universal ideas; but he is most careful to insist, 
especially in his polemic with the Anglican Bishop of Worcester, that 
"there is an internal constitution of things, on which their properties 
depend." So much by way of stating the first antagonistic position, 
which is that our knowledge is limited to the fact of the existence of 
real essences, while for the rest we have to content ourselves with 
nominal essences.<p>
(ii.) and (iii.) The two other positions may be dealt with together, as 
the step from agnosticism to positive denial is only one of audacity in 
making assertions. As a representative writer, we will take Mill, in 
weighing whose utterances we must bear in mind that he allows a 
knowledge of no substance, bodily or mental, and of no efficient 
causality, and of no metaphysically necessary truth; indeed, his theory 
of knowledge is what determines his rejection of essences. These are 
important items to keep in view while considering his assertions with 
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 65 
--><A NAME="p65"></a>
respect to essences, the gist of which may be conveyed in a few 
passages.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> "An essential proposition is one which is purely verbal; 
which asserts of a thing, under a particular name, only what is 
asserted of it in the fact of calling it by that name; and which, 
therefore, either gives no information, or gives it respecting the 
name, not the thing. Nonessential or accidental propositions may be 
called <i>real</i> propositions in opposition to <i>verbal</i>." In 
other words, no analytical proposition conveys any real information; 
and that to which we are at liberty to apply the word <i>essential</i>, 
is at most an explanation of the meaning of a word. With the 
understanding that the matter is a verbal one, we may claim to know the 
essence of classes: "The distinction between the essence of a class and 
the attributes, or properties which are not essential, amounts to 
nothing more than the difference between those attributes of a class 
which are, and those which are not, involved in the connotation 
(meaning) of a class-name." So much for what is allowed; now for what 
is disallowed: "As applied to individuals, the word essence has no 
meaning, except in connexion with the exploded tenets of the realists; 
and what the schoolmen chose to call the essence of an individual, was 
the essence of the class to which the individual was most familiarly 
referred." Here Mill falls into the ordinary blunder of attributing to 
the schoolmen generally, what was the extravagance of a comparative 
few; <sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> and accordingly he goes on to identify 
<!--
66 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p66"></a>
the doctrine of essences with an error which most of the defenders of 
that doctrine thoroughly repudiate. "Aristotelians thought that ice was 
made ice, not by the possession of certain properties to which mankind 
have chosen to attach that name, but by a <i>participation in the nature 
of a certain general substance</i>."<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Of course, Platonists rather than 
Aristotelians would be likely to commit such an extravagance; but Mill 
says boldly and without limitation, "Aristotelians." Next we come to a 
statement of Mill's own position: "The inmost nature or essence of a 
thing is apt to be regarded as something unknown, which, if we knew it, 
would account for all the phenomena which the thing exhibits to us. But 
this unknown something is a supposition without evidence. We have no 
ground to suppose that there is anything, which, if known to us, would 
afford to our intellect this satisfaction: would sum up, as it were, 
the knowable attributes of an object in a single sentence. Moreover, if 
there were such a central property, it would not answer to the idea of 
an inmost nature: for if knowable by any intelligence, it must, like 
other properties, be relative to the intelligence which knows it, that 
is, it must consist in impressing that intelligence in some special 
way; the only sense in which the verb <i>to know</i> means anything."<p>
According to Mill, therefore, an essential property is one which is 
part of the very definition or meaning of the word which stands as 
subject in a sentence; 
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 67 
--><A NAME="p67"></a>
and such essence is verbal, not real. As for any real essential nature 
in physical things, we know of none such, and in any case the 
relativity of all knowledge would be a bar to the knowledge of 
essences, such as the schoolmen assert. Here we have a doctrine common 
in the school of Hume: and we will illustrate it no further except by 
letting Lewes repeat its chief tenets. He likens the Aristotelian 
essences to the pure space which is supposed to be the background of 
all things; essences are empty as space, mere negations of all 
attributes or phenomena: indeed there can be no absolute thing in 
itself, for "nothing exists in and for itself," and the universe known 
to us is a system of correlated events.<p>
Whether on the above principles, the attitude taken with respect to 
essences is one of agnosticism or of positive denial matters little for 
the refutation which we have to give of the whole doctrine: but at 
least the positive denial sounds not a little arbitrary.<p>
(b) In doing something to rehabilitate a much discredited teaching of 
the schoolmen, we may start from less disputed points. At least in the 
abstract sciences, and notably in mathematics, it is maintainable that 
we can devise essential definitions which stand good amid accidental 
variations, and have a most unmistakeably real<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> significance. Reid 
confesses as much when he says, that from the essence of a triangle we 
are able to deduce its properties. We can determine exactly what 
con<!--
68 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p68"></a>stitutes the precise nature of certain figures, distinguishes them 
specifically from other figures, and enables us to infer their 
necessary attributes. In regard to this deduction we must not let 
ourselves be puzzled by the very narrow limits within which some have 
chosen to confine our data: as, for example, when it is declared that 
from the nature of a straight line we cannot infer that it is the 
shortest way between two points, because the notion "straight line" 
does not contain the notion "shortest way;" or again, when it is 
declared that certain conclusions are not <i>a priori</i> because we 
mentally construct a geometrical figure in order to follow out our 
reasoning, and thus institute a sort of experiment <i>a posteriori</i>. 
It is intolerable so to take out all meaning from the process of 
deduction as to deny that we are using it because, in arguing from 
essential definitions, we picture objects to the mind, or use terms not 
verbally identical with the terms which are explicitly set down as the 
data. On this rigorist interpretation no proposition in Euclid would 
give deductive results. We could not deduce from the nature of a 
triangle that its angles are equal to two right angles, because its 
definition does not say, for instance, what a right angle is. Remove 
these unwarrantable restrictions and it may be fairly affirmed that in 
mathematics we find examples of real essences,<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> and of their deduced 
properties. Moral science would furnish us with similar results; but we 
must 
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 69 
--><A NAME="p69"></a>
hasten on to the main controversy, the essences of natural objects in 
the concrete.<p>
To start with, it may be observed, that to fight out this battle to the 
end belongs, not to General, but to Special Metaphysics -- to 
Cosmology, which treats of such questions as the ultimate constitution 
of bodies, and to Psychology, which lays down what is meant by a 
spiritual substance. As to the essence of matter we may note two 
divergent tendencies. Those whose training, before they take up 
philosophy, has lain largely in chemical analyses and syntheses, and in 
reducing what they see in physical nature to mathematical formulae, are 
apt to assume without any hesitation that, given a few elementary atoms 
which are unaccounted for, all the other differences between bodies 
must be simply matters of arrangement between parts; all are 
accidental, none substantial; all are extra-essential, none 
intrinsically essential. Contrariwise with the man who takes up 
philosophy, without previous training in physical science, having his 
mind unfamiliar with the conceptions of chemistry and mathematics, his 
tendency is to regard all striking changes as replacements of one 
essence by another, never as rearrangements of the same elemental 
forces. Hence there is a difficulty to get the opposite sides fairly to 
weigh each other's arguments. While it is an undoubted want in a man's 
mind, if it has never taken up Descartes' great idea of applying 
algebraic symbols to material phenomena, on the other hand it is 
decidedly a mental twist to have Descartes' exaggerated notions about 
<!--
70 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p70"></a>
the sufficiency of algebraic symbols to explain matter. To represent 
the scholastics of the present time as men all ignorant of experimental 
science would be as inaccurate as to represent them as all clinging, 
without abatement, to the old multiplicity of essential forms in all 
their abundance. One point on which they are unanimous is, that the 
soul is not indeed the body, but the essential form of the human body; 
few would deny a similar office to a vital principle in the mere 
animals: very many affirm the like for vegetative life: and below this 
point the dissidents begin to multiply.<p>
It belongs to another treatise to attempt an adjudication of this very 
difficult controversy: but we at present must try a simpler method of 
justifying the assertion that we can know something about essential 
natures. In the rough the form of expression could hardly be rejected, 
that science seeks to arrive at the very nature of things, and has some 
measure of success in the enterprise. Even Mill allows us this much; 
for in one of the very chapters where he has been scouting the doctrine 
of definitions which profess to give the real essences of things, he 
comes round,<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> at the close of his discussion, to these admissions: 
"Whenever the inquiry into the definition of the name of any real 
object consists of anything else than a mere comparison of authorities, 
we tacitly assume that a meaning must be found for the name compatible 
with its continuing to denote, if possible all, but at any rate the 
greater or more important part, of the
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 71 
--><A NAME="p71"></a>
things of which it is commonly predicated. The inquiry, therefore, 
into the definition is an inquiry <i>into the resemblances and 
differences among those things</i>; whether there be any resemblance 
running through them all; if not, through what portion a general 
resemblance can be traced; and finally what are the common attributes 
the possession of which gives to them all, or to that portion of them, 
the character of resemblance which has led to their being classed 
together?" So far Mill's words do something to relieve definitions from 
his charge that they are <i>nominal</i>, not <i>real</i>: and that "the 
simplest and most correct notion of a definition is, a proposition 
declaratory of the meaning of a word." What follows in the same extract 
will do something to relieve the definition from the further charge 
that its claim to be <i>essential</i> is a false pretence. "In giving a 
distinct connotation (meaning) to the general name, the philosopher 
will endeavour to fix upon such as are common to all the things usually 
denoted by the name, as also <i>of the greatest importance in 
themselves</i>; either directly, or from the number, the 
conspicuousness, or the interesting character <i>of the consequences to 
which they lead</i>. He will select as far as possible such 
<i>differentiae</i> as <i>lead to</i> the greatest number of 
interesting <i>propria</i>. But to <i>penetrate to the more hidden 
agreement on which these more obvious and suferficial agreements 
depend</i>, is often one of the most difficult of scientific problems. 
And as it is among the most difficult, so it seldom fails to be among 
<i>the most important</i>."<p>
We express no surprise that Mill should have
<!--
72 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p72"></a>
spoken so; he would have had to be egregiously ignorant of the nature 
of science if he had described its inquiries as anything less radical. 
It was his irrational denial of substance and efficient causality, and 
his equivalent denial of any knowledge beyond that of each one's own 
states of sensation, thought, and volition, that made him refuse to 
admit that the definitions of science were real and had some degree of 
success in assigning essences. In spite of his denials, a confession 
that definitions are more than nominal and accidental is clearly 
implied in such a sentence as this: "Since upon the result of the 
inquiry <i>respecting the causes of the properties</i> of a class of 
<i>things</i>, there <i>incidentally</i> depends the question, what 
shall be the <i>meaning of a word</i>: some of the most profound and 
invaluable investigations which philosophy presents to us, have offered 
themselves <i>under the guise of inquiries into the definition of a 
name</i>." So after all, nominal essences are only "incidental" objects 
of scientific inquiry, not the sole inquiries possible to men when they 
search into essences.<p>
As it is highly advantageous to our cause to show our several 
adversaries in the act of conceding to us the foundations on which we 
build our argument, alongside of Mill's utterances we will place a 
sentence from one who is his closest colleague. Mr. Bain, who, however, 
says elsewhere that he is not sure that there is anything more in 
matter left for us to discover; that he is not convinced that there is 
a picture beyond what we call the veil, but that our veil may be the 
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 73 
--><A NAME="p73"></a>
picture; nevertheless writes as follows:<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> "If we understood more 
thoroughly the ultimate arrangement of the atoms of bodies, we might 
not improbably find that one fundamental property was the <i>foundation 
-- a real essence</i>, of which the other characters are but the 
<i>propria</i>." It is something of this kind that we want to show.<p>
The substantial gain to be got out of these quotations from adversaries 
is, not that they fully concede our doctrine, but that they supply 
corrections to errors in their own context: that they furnish us with a 
part of our argument; and that they are admissions which only need 
interpreting on better principles with regard to the nature of human 
knowledge, in order to lead to our conclusions.<p>
We cannot lay too much emphasis on the fact that scepticism in the 
school of Hume about essences, does not begin at this point; it rests 
on utterly false theories about man's power of knowledge, which is 
logically reduced to a mere chemistry of ideas, or of the phenomenal 
states of self-consciousness. Of course on these shifting and 
unsubstantial grounds we can build up no knowledge of essences. Hence 
the brunt of the battle falls to the share of another manual in this 
series. Nevertheless, even here, where we presuppose our own theory of 
knowledge, we must put forth a defence of the 
<!--
74 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p74"></a>
doctrine that we can attain to some insight into essences.<p>
Our claim is moderate. We fully admit that the human intellect has a 
very imperfect acquaintance with essences, and must often put up with 
make-shifts; or, in the words of St. Thomas,<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> "because the essential 
differences of things are frequently unknown, we use accidental 
differences to mark those which are essential." Thus on the hypothesis 
-- which we need not discuss -- that there is an essential difference 
between gold and silver, certainly we do not penetrate to this 
fundamental distinction, but have to discriminate it by such accidental 
characters as specific gravity, solubility, colour, and so forth. It is 
important to notice here, how St. Thomas himself removes that stone of 
stumbling which many fancy that they find over and over again in the 
scholastic system. He distinctly affirms that essences can often be 
indicated by us only in an indirect way, through nonessential 
characteristics. Here, perhaps, is the best place to enter a caution 
against a way of speaking, which often leads to fatal misconceptions on 
the part of hearers, and is not always without mistake on the part of 
the speakers. It is often said that "simple apprehension" seizes the 
essences of things, and that universal ideas also are about essences. 
The assertion is clearly true of essence in the wider sense, and often 
as clearly untrue of essence in the narrower sense. Certainly it is not 
the way of physical science to discover the inmost nature of
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 75 
--><A NAME="p75"></a>
objects by easy intuition, but rather by laborious methods of 
inference from phenomena; and as to universal ideas there are more of 
them that refer to "accidents" than to "essences."<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> Further it is to 
be noted, that if we take essences, not in the concrete, but for the 
generalized essences which are reached by mental abstraction, then 
frequently we do, at first starting, apprehend objects under the 
universal and essential ideas of Thing, Substance, Body, and even under 
more determinate conceptions that are essential inasmuch as they give 
the general nature of the object, as man, boy, sailor; all which are 
immediate perceptions only on the supposition of many previous 
experiences as to what outside appearances imply. Furthermore, the 
observation is to the point, that we must not confuse "simple 
apprehension," when it means mere apprehension as distinguished from 
judgment, with "simple apprehension," when it means apprehension of a 
simple, as distinguished from a complex object. Of a nursery rhyme we 
could say that it was "simple nonsense," meaning thereby a simplicity 
that could not be meant when a bitter opponent of Hegel affirmed that 
his system was "simple nonsense." One would be nonsense of a simple 
character, the other of a character anything but simple. If, therefore, 
we take "simple apprehension" to be, as St. Thomas calls it, 
<i>intelligentia indivisibilium et incomplexorum</i>, "the perception 
of what is indivisible and without complexity," then the notions so 
gathered are our most elementary intuitions; they form the very 
fundamentals or
<!--
76 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p76"></a>
essentials of knowledge; they give us our first principles.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup><p>
After attending to these most necessary warnings we proceed with our 
vindication for man of some knowledge about essences in the stricter 
sense of the term; or about that in things which, as far as they are 
concerned, makes them what precisely they are, which, as far as our 
investigations into them are concerned, answers our question, What? and 
which, as far as their operations are concerned, is more particularly 
called their nature.<p>
As a scheme for making our general position more readily understood, we 
will take the broad division of things into matter and spirit, and 
begin by asking what we know of material essences. At first we are 
struck by the apparent anomaly, that here we seem to know complex much 
better than simple essences. It appears that a chemist knows what the 
nature of water is, but not what is the nature of either of its 
component elements. The fallacy here is kindred with the common 
delusion that evident inference is satisfactory, while the evident 
intuition of simple, irresolvable truth is not. Undoubtedly, if the 
chemist assumes a certain number of ultimate substances, he can trace 
all other inorganic bodies, and in some sense all organic bodies, to 
his primitive components. The main point left for discussion in regard 
to the compound is, whether it is rigorously a new substance, or only 
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 77
--><A NAME="p77"></a>
a very intimate re-arrangement of old substances. Given the elements, 
it is known <i>what</i> are the elements that combine, and in 
<i>what</i> proportions, and under <i>what</i> conditions, they combine 
to produce <i>what</i> results; all these are <i>whats</i> or 
<i>quiddities</i>, known within certain limits. But if we fall back 
upon the assumed elements, which hitherto have been taken as mere data, 
then they are found all along to have demanded explanation, and not to 
have had properly assigned to them their essential definitions. 
Probably many of them are really compounds, resolvable into simpler 
constituents; but if we imagine ourselves at length to have arrived at 
our ultimate element or elements of matter, what do we know of essences 
there? Those who are convinced that the Aristotelian theory of matter 
and form<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> is correct, may call their doctrine a theory that goes 
pretty near to the root or essence of the question; those who hold one 
or other of the remaining theories which have gained credit in 
philosophy. vary in what, after a new sense of the word, we may call 
their <i>radicalism</i>; that is, their definitions of matter go, some 
more, some less, near to the root. Lastly, those who are unconvinced by 
any of the prevalent theories about the essential constitution of 
matter are in the case which we have heard St. Thomas describe: because 
to them "essential differences are unknown," they "use accidental 
differences to mark those which are substantial." They describe matter 
by its most general properties, <i>weight, inertia, extension</i>, and 
<i>impenetrability</i>. 
<!--
78 BEING.  
--><A NAME="p78"></a><p>
If, therefore, it be asked what, after all, do the schoolmen know about 
the essence of matter, and if we frame our reply so as to keep clear of 
points controverted among them; then from the position of General 
Metaphysics we answer by telling the inquirer to consult two sources of 
information: first, books treating of cosmology, and arguing their case 
largely on metaphysical principles and in reference to matter in its 
most generic sense; and next, books treating of the several special 
sciences, and arguing their case on physical principles and in 
reference to matter in some specific order. Our contention is that, 
when together, these books do show some knowledge, more or less 
adequate, about <i>essences</i>; that they do furnish replies, more or 
less final, to the question, what is this, that, and the other. For 
example the laws of motion, of gravitation, and of combination by 
definite proportions; the reduction of light and sound to vibratory 
movements calculable mathematically; the doctrine of the transformation 
of energy; the assertion of comparatively few chemical elements -- all 
these are approximations to a knowledge of essences; they are the 
knowledge of what, with a certain looseness of expression, may be 
called secondary or derivative essences. Again, to know matter as 
substance and efficient cause is to know it under an essential aspect, 
though a highly generalized one. Even the classificatory sciences, such 
as botany and zoology, which in part at least are concerned with 
matter, so far as they go on "a natural system," point in the direction 
of 
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 79 
--><A NAME="p79"></a>
essences. In short, the very admission that there is such a thing as 
physical science, and that science is <i>cognitio rerum per causas</i> 
-- a knowledge of things according to the rationale of them -- is 
tantamount to saying, that some manner of acquaintance with essences is 
possible; that the world does present its objects ranged according to 
at least a certain number of different kinds, and that we can do 
something to mark off one kind from another.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> Whatever be the extent 
of "the law of continuity," at least it does not abolish every single 
specific difference in the world; and there are other differences that 
have established a character which is, if not in the fullest sense 
specific, at least is secondarily and practically specific: for example 
the difference between "chalk and cheese." To this moderate extent the 
schoolmen are justified in their pretensions to have knowledge of 
essences; but if we must signalize the points most provocative of 
debate within the modern scholastic camp, it is the multiplication of 
essential forms to account for what are called the substantial changes 
of chemical composition or decomposition, and the assumption concerning 
the irresolvable elements, that they are constituted by two real 
distinct principles, one 
<!--
80 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p80"></a>
active and the other passive, one form and the other matter.<p>
Such is a short statement of what we claim to know about the essences 
of the material universe; and if the account is examined carefully, it 
will be found not to differ so very widely from the one which our more 
moderate adversaries give, when they are delivering, not their worse, 
but their better sentiments on the subject. Let De Morgan stand as an 
example: "The most difficult inquiry which one can propose to oneself 
is, to find out what anything is: in all probability we do not know 
what we are talking about when we ask such a question. The philosophers 
of the middle ages were much concerned with the <i>is</i> or 
<i>essence</i> of things; they argued to their own minds, with great 
justice,<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> that if they could only find out what a thing is, they 
would find out all about it: they tried and failed. Their successors, 
taking warning by their example, have inverted the proposition and have 
satisfied themselves that the only way to find out what a thing is, 
lies in finding out what we can about it." Precisely so taught 
Aristotle, and so teach we: it is quite false to say with Mill, that 
our doctrine of essences implies the ultra-realistic belief in 
universals <i>a parte rei</i>, or to say that it supposes <i>a 
priori</i> conceptions of essences, not gathered from experience. We 
may read of a mystic like Boehme, that walking one day near 
G&ouml;rlitz, he had suddenly revealed to him the essences, the 
properties, and the uses of 
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 81 
--><A NAME="p81"></a>
herbs, so that he was able to write his book <i>De Signatura 
Rerum</i>: yet even so it was from the outer appearances of plants that 
he argued what their curative powers must be. Many also of the 
antischolastic writers of the Renaissance, such as the Cabbalists, 
Reuchlin, and Cornelius Agrippa, or the physicists Cardanus and 
Paracelsus, are recorded to have claimed a sort of intuition into 
essences, or a discovery of them by other than scientific means. But we 
are quite content with De Morgan's system of inferring what a thing is, 
after observing what it does.<p>
In beginning our sketch of the position which scholastic philosophy has 
been able to secure for itself, in regard to the actual knowledge of 
essences, we chose Matter for our first subject of examination: we have 
yet to consider the case in respect of Spirit. Those who accept the 
doctrine of Matter and Form as satisfactorily accounting for bodily 
substance, would assert that Spirit is Form without any Matter to act 
as a joint constituent with itself of the spiritual substance as such: 
though the spiritual part of man may take the place of form in regard 
to his corporeal part. Those who doubt the doctrine would yet have 
left, by way of approximations to the ultimate essence, the known 
characteristics of Spirit, which are that it is an inextended substance 
acting by means of intelligence and will, especially of intelligence, 
which shows itself to be perfectly self-reflective, and of will, which 
shows itself to be free. Then on De Morgan's principle that we can 
infer what a thing <i>is</i> from what it <i>does</i>, they would
<!--
82 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p82"></a>
assert that the phenomena of Spirit give some information about its 
nature or essence: what manner of substance it is appears from its 
manner of action.<p>
After the above statements, the proof that we can know something of 
essences may be put into a short syllogism.<p>
Those persons can know something of essences who, first, have the power 
of genuine intellectual abstraction from the conditions of mere
sense-cognitions, so that they can know things under the form of 
<i>quiddities</i>, or in answer to the question, <i>What</i> are they? 
and who, secondly, have a genuine power of inference, whereby from the 
modes of its activity they can calculate the nature of an agent.<p>
But we have these powers.<p>
Therefore we can know something of essences.<p>
Thus it is an approach to essential knowledge when we know why the 
loudness of sound decreases with the distance from its source, and can 
trace this diminution to the laws of vibratory propagation in an 
elastic medium. Again, if planetary motion is really accounted for by 
an initial impulse and a central attraction, that again is at least an 
approach to the knowledge of an essence.<p>
It may be urged, that "the plurality of causes," or the doctrine that 
like effects may spring from agents differing in kind, is against any 
certain conclusion drawn from actions to essences. The reply is, that 
this obstacle not unfrequently makes itself felt, and not unfrequently 
it does not. The principle, if pushed to its extremes, would forbid 
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 83 
--><A NAME="p83"></a>
the certain identification of any criminal, because different 
individuals may present the same outside appearances. Such similarity 
is occasionally a bar to identification, but not always.<p>
(3) For expressing the essences of things, there are two ways open, 
advertence to which will be a security against a not improbable source 
of confusion. We may take the constituent parts of an essence either 
according to physical, or according to metaphysical considerations; 
that is, so that the members are different in themselves, apart from 
any act of distinguishing thought, or so that the distinction made by 
our thought is not, and could not, exactly be realized outside thought. 
Thus, if we give body and soul as the components of man, the division 
is physical; if we give animality and rationality, the division is 
metaphysical, and the same is to be said of the distinction between a 
man's nature and his individuality. It is called metaphysical division 
inasmuch as it passes the power of the physical conditious of 
existence, and can be effected only by mental abstraction.<p>
To connect what has just been laid down with what was previously said 
about "second intentions," we must recall how the test of the latter 
is, that they cannot be affirmed of objects as these exist, or might 
exist in themselves, but only so far as they receive a denomination 
proper to them as objects contemplated by the mind. An abstract nature 
regarded as common to several individuals is, on this criterion, a 
"second intention," for there is no universal <i>a parte rei</i>. When, 
however, we say that
<!--
84 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p84"></a>
the metaphysical constituents of essences can be distinguished only by 
the mind, and have not an actual distinction <i>in rerum natura</i>, we 
do not thereby debar them from being predicated in "first intention" of 
the wholes to which they belong. Thus we can affirm "in first 
intention" or of the man himself, that he has "animality" and 
"rationality," "nature" and "individuality." There are some who include 
these abstract terms under "second intentions," but we have chosen the 
narrower definition.<p>
(4) We have arrived at the place where a controversy is often 
introduced about the distinction between essence and existence in 
created objects. We shall not enter into the controversy, but we cannot 
leave it unmentioned because it affects some of our own doctrines up 
and down this treatise. Essence we have already explained; and 
existence, though it is too elementary a notion to be rigidly defined, 
can be described to mean "the complement of possibility," "that whereby 
a thing is placed outside its causes, and has its own actual presence 
in the universe," "the actuality of an essence." About essence and 
existence these are the rough outlines of the disputation to which we 
wish to call attention:<p>
(a) The controversy has no point for those who do not believe in God as 
the sole self-existent Being, and in finite things as receiving the 
whole of their Being, possible and actual, from God.<p>
(b) There is no controversy, but full accord among the disputants, 
about the perfect identity 
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 85  
--><A NAME="p85"></a>
essence and existence in God; as also about a certain sort of real 
distinction between any creature <i>in its merely possible state</i>, 
and the same creature <i>in its actual state</i>; a possible Adam is 
really other than an actual Adam.<p>
(c) What is controverted is, whether <i>in an actually existent 
creature</i>, the actuated essence is really distinct from its 
existence, the former being id <i>quod</i> existit (that which exists), 
and the latter, id <i>quo</i> existit (that whereby it exists).<p>
(d) The affirmers of the real distinction appeal to the fact, that. 
only of God can it be said that existence is of His essence, and that 
the essence of any finite thing does not include among its constituent 
notes the note of existence. Opponents reply that so long as creatures 
are maintained to be totally created by God out of nothing, and not to 
have existence implied in their essence, when that essence is 
considered in the abstract, and metaphysically, for example, when man 
is considered as "rational animality;" so long the difference between 
the necessary existence of God and the contingent existence of anything 
else, is abundantly emphasized. The two sides of the question are 
argued respectively by Egidius, <i>Tractatus de Esse et Essentia</i>, 
q. ix., and Suarez, <i>Metaphvs.</i> disp. xxxi. sect. 4, 5, 6. A main 
difficulty felt by impugners of the real distinction, lies in their 
reluctance to allow, at least in this particular case, a distinct 
reality which is a mere <i>quo</i> and not a <i>quod</i> -- an 
existence which is not a <i>somewhat</i>, but only a <i>whereby</i> -- 
the <i>whereby</i> through which the <i>somewhat</i> exists.

NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.<p>
(1) An outline<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> of the scholastic theory about material substance is 
needful to explain what has been said about our knowledge of essence, 
and is here presented for inspection:<p>
(a) As a result not of <i>a priori</i> speculation, but of observed 
phenomena, it is contended that Matter presents a double series of 
manifestations; it is not only active but passive; not only one in its 
nature, but manifold in its extended parts; not only special in its own 
nature, but generically common in all natures; furthermore, it changes 
from one nature to another, and that by way of transformation, not of 
simple substitution, for there is something common to it before and 
after the change.<p>
(b) To produce these opposite results it is argued that two opposite 
principles are required, one called primordial matter (<i>materia 
prima</i>, <b>h&ecirc; pr&ocirc;ton hul&ecirc;</b>) the other 
substantial form (<i>forma, actus primus</i>, <b>eidos, morph&ecirc;, 
entelecheia, energeia</b>). Matter is passive, indeterminate, but 
determinable, the principle of multiplicity, the constant under all 
changes; form is active, determinate and determining, the principle of 
unity, the variable under all substantial changes. While forms come 
and go, matter is the same throughout, not being liable to "corruption 
and generation."<p>
(c) The opposition here is declared to be so real that the two 
principles must be really distinct, not as two distinct things, but as 
two constituents of one thing. Some scholastics indeed say that <i>materia 
prima</i> has a sort of incomplete entity of its own; but Aristotle's
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 87
--><A NAME="p87"></a>
description of it is that it has<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> "neither quiddity, nor quantity, 
nor quality, nor any of the determinants of Being." Thus in completest 
contrast to God, who is pure act, it is pure potentiality or 
determinability, wholly actuated and determined by some form, in 
conjunction with which alone it can exist, and towards which its one 
function is to serve as subject or support, and constitute with it a 
single Being. Hence corporeal Being results from the coalescence of the 
two components, neither of which could connaturally exist apart: the 
form is the <i>primus actus</i>, actuating the <i>pura potentia</i>, 
and so giving rise to the <i>primum esse rei</i>. Each principle apart 
is rather <i>id quo aliquid est</i>, than <i>id quod est</i>: only the 
compound is <i>id quod est</i>.<p>
The system of dynamism takes various shapes, but its tendency is to 
insist only upon the active or formal element, as centred at 
indivisible points;<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> whereas atomism, which also takes many shapes, 
in its cruder form tends to the assertion of mere passive 
matter-elements, upon which a certain quantity of motion has been 
impressed from outside, and is now handed about without change of total 
quantity, by some mode of transference which is left unexplained. These 
two are the extremes to which, however, neither of the systems need be 
pushed.<p>
(2) It is impossible to disabuse the average British philosopher of 
Mill's delusive idea, that the doctrine
<!--
88 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p88"></a>
of real essences is one with the doctrine that each species of thing 
has one <i>ipsissima essentia</i> physically common to all the 
individuals, which are specifically what they are only by participation 
in this single form. But if any honest Inquirer wants to satisfy his 
conscience on this point, let him look, if not directly at the 
treatment of <i>Essence</i> in the scholastic books, then at any rate 
at their treatment of <i>Universal ideas</i>. The same reference, 
especially if supplemented by a glance at what is said about the origin 
of ideas, will likewise satisfy him on another subject; for thus it 
will appear that essences are not supposed to be known <i>a priori</i> 
and to lead deductively to physical science, but they are inferred <i>a 
posteriori</i> . It would be rather a Platonist with his theory of 
reminiscence, than an Aristotelian, who would thoroughly chime in with 
Browning's verses in "Paracelsus:"<p>
<blockquote>
There is an inmost Centre in us all.<br> 
Where truth abides in fulness; and to know<br>
Rather Consists in opening out a way,<br>
Whence the imprisoned splendour may escape,<br>
Than in effecting entrance for a light<br>
Supposed to be without.
</blockquote><p>
Yet this is vulgarly supposed to be the commonly accepted tenet of 
scholasticism. When, therefore, essence is sometimes defined as "that 
which is conceived first in a thing, and from which all the properties 
are conceived to flow," we must take "first" not in the order of time, 
not in the order of the acquisition of knowledge, but in the order of 
relationship between the several constituents of the object known. Or 
we must take first in the order truths, not in the order of our 
knowledge of truths.<p>
(3) <i>Essence</i> and <i>nature</i> with the scholastics are often 
synonymous. <i>Nature</i> etymologically is that which a thing is, as 
it were by birth or genesis: thus it is a term 
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 89 
--><A NAME="p89"></a>
apt to signify the kind to which a thing belongs. But as its special 
signification nature means the thing on its active side: and thus 
Aristotle gives the definition,<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> "Nature is the substance or essence 
of things, which have in themselves, as such, a principle of motion or 
activity." As it is only by the activities of an object upon us that we 
can know it, activities for us determine its nature. Hence, subject to 
our own interpretation, the words of Hume, the empiricist, will suit 
us:<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> "For me it seems evident that the essence (or nature) of mind 
being equally unknown to us with that of external bodies, it must be 
equally impossible to form any notion of its powers and qualities, 
otherwise than from careful and exact experiments, and the observation 
of their particular effects, which result from its different 
circumstances and situations. And though we must endeavour to render 
all our principles as universal as possible, by tracing up our 
experiments to their utmost, and explaining all effects from the 
simplest and fewest causes, 'tis still certain that we cannot go beyond 
experience."<p>
(4) Mill admits distinct "natures" in the universe, so far as he admits 
differences between "real kinds." But instead of explaining these after 
anything like the manner of definite essences, he has recourse to the 
note of indefiniteness for his discriminating sign: so that a definable 
essence, giving rise to a deducible series of properties, from the very 
completeness of its self-revelation, would not be a "real kind." "There 
is no impropriety," writes Mill,<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> "in saying that of these two 
classifications," into real and not-real kinds, "the one answers to a 
much more radical dis<!--
90 BEING.  
--><A NAME="p90"></a>tinction in things themselves than the other does. And if any one 
ever chooses to say that the one classification is made by nature, the 
other by us for our convenience, he will be right, provided he means no 
more than this: Where a certain apparent difference between things 
(though perhaps in itself of little moment) answers to <i>we know not 
what number of differences</i>, pervading not only their known 
properties, but properties yet undiscovered, it is not optional but 
imperative to recognize this difference as the foundation of a specific 
difference; while, on the contrary, differences that are <i>merely 
finite and determinate</i>, like those designated by the words 'white,' 
'black,' or 'red,' may be disregarded if the purpose for which the 
classification is made does not require attention to these particular 
properties. The differences, howeyer, are made by nature in both cases; 
only in the one case the ends of language and classification would be 
subverted if no notice were taken of the difference, while in the other 
case the necessity of taking notice of it depends on the importance or 
unimportance of the particular qualities in which the difference 
happens to consist" Thus "the <i>real kinds</i> are distinguished by 
unknown multitudes of properties," <i>the not-real kinds</i> "by a few 
determinate ones."<p>
Mr. Bain faithfully repeats the like ideas:<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> "<i>A natural kind 
is</i> distinguished by containing not one, two, three, or four 
features of community, but a very large, indefinite, and, perhaps, 
inexhaustible number. Oxygen has a great many properties; the aggregate 
of all these is properly the meaning of the word." Thus an object is 
defined by all its ascertainable predicates, not by select essential 
notes. For instance, "the technically correct form of predication would 
be as follows: There exists in nature an aggregate of these properties 
<!--
ESSENCE AND EXISTENCE. 91 
--><A NAME="p91"></a>
matter, transparency, the gaseous form, a certain specific gravity, 
active combining power, and so on: to which aggregation is applied the 
name <i>Oxygen</i>." It may be noted that to illustrate a specific 
definition, Oxygen is inconveniently chosen, because it is to us an 
irresolvable element, and can be designated only by such rather 
superficial marks as we have been able to discover.<p>
(5) However much some may think such discussions obsolete, yet in his 
<i>Types of Ethical Theory</i>, Dr. Martineau gives us an instance of 
an Englishman, in the present century, still discussing the relation of 
Essence and Existence. His words show his disagreement with Hume's 
assertion,<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> "that the idea of existence is the very same with the idea 
of what we conceive to be existent, and makes no addition to it:" so 
that to declare a thing existent signifies only a "certain liveliness 
in the idea." Dr. Martineau says, "The relation between existence and 
essence is perverted if the former [in created things] is treated as 
one of the characters that make up the latter, and may be elicited 
thence. Every essence is the essence of something, and needs an 
existence to hold and own it, and you cannot depose existence from the 
place of substantive priority, and send it down to do duty as a 
property among the factors of the essence; a property, moreover, not 
generally found there, but only in the special case of uncreated 
things. The essence of anything is that which, being posited, gives the 
thing, and being withheld, excludes it. But this positing may be in 
either of two fields. Do you say it in the field of thought? Then it 
may mean that your idea of essence includes your idea of existence. Do 
you say it in the field of fact? Then it means that the essence cannot 
be real
<!--
92 BEING.
--><A NAME="p92"></a>
without the thing being real. But from the conceptual essence to the 
real existence there in no passage, except by the leap of a postulate. 
The logical constitution of our conception is assumed to be adequate 
security for the actual." These remarks are <i>&agrave; propos</i> of 
St. Anselm's argument for the existence of God as proved by the very 
idea of a most perfect Being. The force of the argument is discussed in 
Natural Theology, where most authors agree with Dr. Martineau that it 
does not suffice by itself alone, without calling in the aid of an <i>a 
posteriori</i> element,<p>
