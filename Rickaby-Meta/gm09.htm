CAUSALITY.</h4></center><ul><p>
<i>Synopsis.</i><p>
(1) Various sorts of causality; selection of efficient causality for 
special treatment.<p>
(2) The opposition made to efficient causality, (a) on the part of 
"Occasionalists," who allow its reality; but attribute it directly to 
God, and (b) on the part of pure Empiricists who deny it to be a known 
reality.<p>
(3) Proof (a) that there is efficient causality in the world, and (b) 
that this causality is not divine but mundane.<p>
(4) Explanation of some statements about efficient causality, which 
need clearing up: (a) "The effect is like its cause." (b) "The cause is 
prior to its effect." (c) "The same cause under the same circumstances 
has always the same effect." (d) "On the cessation of the cause the 
effect sometimes ceases, sometimes not." (e) "A cause is more than a 
condition."<p>
<i>Notes and Illustrations</i>.</ul><p>
(1) A WIDER term than <i>cause</i> is <i>principium</i>, or 
<i>principle</i>, which is defined to be,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> "that from which anything 
in any way proceeds," whether the bond between the two be intrinsic, or 
only extrinsic; whether it be real, or only logical. In Logic the 
premisses are the principles whence the conclusion follows; in the 
order of knowledge they are theoretically supposed to stand first, and 
it comes after; but in the order of real sequence it may very well be 
the other way about, as when from observed  effects we infer the 
producing causes. Here, how 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 299 
--><A NAME="p299"></a> 
ever, we have not to treat of logical "principiation," But of real.<p>
The order of priority is three-fold: it may be that of <i>mere 
time</i>, as when January the 1st, according to our calculation, is 
called the principle whence the year starts: it may be that of nature, 
in which priority of time may or may not be included, as when the 
essence of a creature is said to be the principle of its "propria," 
that is, of its peculiarly inseparable attributes, or the soul is said 
to be the principle of life in the body: and lastly it may be that of 
origin, a name devised to express that the Father is principle of the 
Son, and the Father and the Son form the joint principle of the Holy 
Ghost, without any priority or superiority either of time or of nature.<p>
Principle, as expressing priority of nature, leads us to the general 
idea of cause, which is defined, <i>A principle which by its influence 
determines the existence of something else: or a principle which in 
some way furnishes the ground for the existence of an object; a 
principle which of itself gives birth to something else.</i><sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> In some 
cases the otherness of the effect from the cause is obvious: but there 
are also cases in which it is not so unmistakeable, because the cause 
enters in as a constituent of the total result, which is called the 
effect. Yet in all cases, without exception, St. Thomas<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> insists that 
there is an otherness in the shape of some perfection produced: hence a 
thing that is simply <i>self-<!--
300 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING 
--><A NAME="p300"></a>caused</i>, according to our definition of causality, is an 
impossibility. If ever God is styled the cause of Himself, the phrase 
is an inaccuracy; we should say God is self-existent, or is His own 
sufficient reason. Moreover, His immanent action is quite identical 
with His substance, and has therefore no strict causality; His thoughts 
and volitions, for example, viewed apart from any external effect that 
they produce outside God, are thus identified with the Divine Essence: 
whereas in the immanent action of creatures the agent as agent is 
distinguishable from the agent as patient. We distinguish the soul as 
productive of thought from the result, the soul as informed by its own 
thought: but what precisely the distinction is Psychology must say.<p>
Though Lewes has declared the four Aristotelic causes to be "not 
verifiable, inadequate, and unscientific," we must take leave to set 
aside the verdict as not sound. Reid<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> had previously objected against 
them that they could not be called causes for want of a common generic 
concept, to which difficulty Hamilton had replied that "they have this 
much in common, that each is an antecedent, which not being given, the 
consequent called the effect would not be." Our sufficient reply is, 
that each comes under the definition which we have assigned to cause in 
general, as that which is <i>a principle of Being to another</i>, or 
<i>that upon which the Being of another depends</i>.<p>
<i>Material</i> and <i>formal</i> causes are such, that each 
contributes itself as a constituent of the whole 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 301 
--><A NAME="p301"></a> 
which results from the union of the two. Not by mere mutual 
interaction, but by mutual self-communication, they combine to produce 
the total effect; so that if the subject is said to support the form, 
this support, though grammatically it is represented as an action, is 
not physically an action in the ordinary sense of the word, as when a 
pedestal supports by its action a statue. Accidental unions of the kind 
are such as those between marble and its form in a piece of sculpture, 
and between the mind and its thought: while the connexion of soul and 
body is an instance of substantial union between matter and form. No 
mere presence in space or dynamic interaction will suffice for such 
union: the two causes are constituent, not efficient. Nevertheless, not 
all constituents are straightway to be ranked as matter or form in 
relation to one another: but only such as stand to one another as 
recipient, determinable subject, and determination received. That 
relations of this kind are entered upon so as to produce definite 
effects cannot be denied, and practically is not denied, even by those 
who theoretically ridicule the whole conception of matter and form; the 
only controvertible question is whether the schoolmen have pushed the 
idea too far, and such controversy is out of place here.<p>
It is impossible to explain at any length material and format causality 
without entering upon Special Metaphysics: and therefore we must rest 
content with indicating two of the questions which will be found to 
have received due attention in other treatises; in <i>Cosmology</i> the 
discussion about the ulti<!--
302 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p302"></a>mate constitution of matter, and in <i>Psychology</i> the 
discussion about the substantial union between man's soul and body, 
bring out pretty nearly all that the schoolmen have to say on matter 
and form.<p>
The <i>final</i> cause is another subject which receives its fullest 
degree of attention in the treatise on Natural Theology. There, under 
the heading of the Argument from Design, authors inquire what evidences 
of a planning mind are to be discovered even in the physical univerre; 
whether all the laws and the harmonious working together of the 
material elements to constitute a cosmos, can be ultimately 
attributable to blind forces acting uniformly through. out indefinitely 
long ages. Again, philosophers frequently discuss whether vegetable and 
animal<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> organisms have risen up spontaneously and without foresight, 
or whether they point irresistibly to an intelligent Creator. Lastly, 
the finite intelligence itself is taken into account, and the inquiry 
is made whether it originated out of blind elements without design on 
the part of some Supreme Intelligence. This sketch is enough to show 
how completely the subject of teleology is discussed in the scholastic 
system. If we start from the most certain testimony of consciousness, 
it is thereby put beyond reasonable doubt, that we are induced, by ends 
which we propose to ourselves as desirable, to carry out even long 
series of works in order to achieve such ends. They clearly are causes 
in our 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 303 
--><A NAME="p303"></a> 
regard, not because they compel our efforts, but because at any rate 
they solicit them, and call forth our energies, which would remain 
inactive if there were no solicitation brought to bear upon them. When 
a man, who perhaps otherwise would have been a sluggard, makes it the 
struggle of a lifetime to carry out his fixed purpose of becoming Prime 
Minister of England before he dies; when one who has spent half his 
days in idle luxury is suddenly roused to intense activity in order to 
repair the fortunes of his house which he has ruined, it would be a 
lamentable sacrifice of truth to some pet theory if certain 
philosophers persisted in maintaining that final causes had no real 
influence. So real is their influence that we may call them even 
<i>efficient</i> causes, if only we remember that their efficiency is 
of a peculiar character -- one which is adapted to the manner of acting 
proper to a moral agent, who is moved not physically, but through his 
intelligence and will. It is no part of the doctrine of free-will, as 
adversaries sometimes suppose,<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> that it maintains motiveless action; 
on the contrary, it holds that motives are quite necessary, and that 
freedom consists in following the call of one motive in preference to 
another. The error is rather with some of the opponents of free-will, 
who while they scout the notion of motiveless action, yet deny that 
motives, when regarded precisely as intellectual motives, have any 
causality. Mr. Huxley considers it probable that the conscious 
phenomenon in man 
<!--
304 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p304"></a> 
is a mere concomitant of the choice, in no degree a determinant. We 
take up the position that final causality is absolutely demonstrable 
from an analysis of our own conduct, about which we cannot be deceived.<p>
Final causes include the main object at which we aim, or the end to be 
reached (<i>finis qui</i>); the actual possession, or the actual 
production of this object, accordingly as it is a <i>finis 
possidendus</i> or a <i>finis efficiendus</i>, a goal to be reached, 
like the summit of a mountain, or a work to be accomplished, like the 
carving of a statue (<i>finis quo</i>); and lastly, the person for 
whose sake the object is sought, whether thisbe self or not-self 
(<i>finis cui</i>, or <i>cujus gratia</i>).<p>
The <i>exemplary</i> cause is such as guides the artist in the 
execution of his work, whether it be the copying of a masterpiece, or 
the realization of an original conception. God who created all things, 
not unintelligently, but according to His own prototypic ideas, used 
these as <i>exemplary</i> causes. These may also be regarded as 
<i>formal</i> causes, if we remember that they are extrinsic, not 
intrinsic, to their matter.<p>
But our chief concern in this chapter is with <i>efficient</i> 
causality in the strict sense, as defined by Aristotle, "a principle of 
change in another." The definition is variously reproduced thus: "That 
which by the activity of its powers makes something to be which before 
was not;"<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> "That which 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 305 
--><A NAME="p305"></a> 
transfers from non-existence to existence what was incapable of self-
existence;" "That from the real physical activity of which the 
production of something follows." To defend this definition will be our 
task: but we will premise a few points of detail, not indeed necessary 
to our main object, but still useful. One observation especially 
deserves attention, namely, the relation of efficient causality to the 
chapter on Possibility. In that chapter what we called <i>intrinsic</i> 
possibility mainly engaged our attention, and of <i>extrinsic</i> 
possibility we said very little. The treatment here of efficient 
causation supplies the previous omission.<p>
Answering to every <i>action</i> is a corresponding <i>passion</i>, at 
least if we leave out of account simple creation from nothing, where in 
reference to the whole object the <i>passion</i> is metaphorical rather 
than literal. Again, action is <i>transient</i> or <i>immanent</i> 
according as it passes out of the agent or abides in it as in a 
subject: the action of one billiard ball on another is transient, the 
action of the thinking faculty is immanent. In both cases, though in 
less degree for one than for the other, the schoolmen assert some 
distinction between agent and patient; because even in immanent agency, 
the agent as active and productive must be somehow different from 
itself as passive and receptive. It is an opinion, which St. Thomas at 
least in certain places approves,<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> that the action and the passion, 
are the same thing under different relations; the action is the effect 
as dependent on the cause, the 
<!--
306 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p306"></a> 
passion is the same effect as received by the subject. At this point 
Suarez<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> has a subtle argument whereby he wants to establish a modal 
distinction between the action and its term: but this is a delicate 
question which we may leave for defter hands to manipulate, as our 
broad inquiry turns on much more tangible pivots. If however it is 
remarked upon as strange, that by the above theory we have as a result 
that the action is in the patient, the schoolmen reply that under one 
aspect it is, in another it is not: as that which is produced and 
received into a subject, the action is in the patient; but so far as 
the agency producing and communicating the action belongs to the 
efficient cause, the action was in the latter potentially. Suarez 
further teaches that by acting the agent <i>qua</i> agent, if we regard 
the matter in ultimate analysis, makes no change in itself, but only in 
the patient. To do justice to this assertion we must observe that it 
does not exclude the facts so obvious, at least in material changes, 
that every action is repaid by reaction, so as to make every agent also 
a patient; and also that in a complex agent one part acts upon another, 
so as notably to change the agent as a whole.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> For example, in 
severe bodily labour man in his entirety undergoes many changes. But to 
understand the  
<!--
CAUSALITY. 307 
--><A NAME="p307"></a> 
aspect from which action works no change in the agent as an agent, we 
should have to take a simpler case than ever our rude experience brings 
us across.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup><p>
From these subtleties let us pass to the more tangible matter of 
dispute. We have to settle whether that on which all science ultimately 
rests, namely, efficient causality, is real: and the subject is so 
vital that Hobbes was near the truth when, as he tells us, it dawned 
upon him quite in a startling light, that the most important 
philosophic question a man can put to himself is, Why does anything 
pass from rest to motion, whether it be in physics, or ethics, or 
politics?<p>
(2) If we wish for anything like thoroughness in our appreciation of 
the controversy about efficient causality, we must not shrink from the 
inquiry into what has been actually maintained on the point by the 
champions of each side; and if we have anything like a philosophic 
temper, we shall deem such inquiry interesting rather than wearisome. 
Our opponents may be divided into two great classes (a) those who fully 
allow the fact of causality, but think that certainly in regard to 
matter, and perhaps in regard to mind, God must be the sole cause of 
the activities; and (b) those who, equivalently abolishing causality, 
reduce it to mere constancy of sequence. We will take each of the pair 
separately. 
<!--
3O8 TRANSCENDENTAL BEINC.  
--><A NAME="p3"></a><p>
(a) Occasionalism, which we find St. Thomas already in his time 
opposing,<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> is the name under which the first doctrine that we have 
to attack is known. It teaches that created things are the mere 
occasions on which the Divinity takes the opportunity to act 
conformably to the requirements of the objects present. This theory is 
specially characteristic of the school of Descartes, and is in intimate 
connexion with the reduction of matter by that philosopher to 
extension, with inertia for its chief property. Matter, according to 
him, can itself do nothing: it is a mere receptivity and channel of 
communication or transference for the motion imparted by the Creator: 
it can hand about movement from particle to particle, but it cannot 
originate or destroy any; and thus it is opposed to mind, the very 
essence of which is thought or activity. Matter is inert extension, 
thought is ever-operative inextension. One short paragraph in the 
Principia<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> is a complete exposition of the theory: "We must consider 
motion in its two causes, the primary and universal cause, to which is 
due all the motion that is in the world, and the particular cause to 
which it is due that various portions of matter acquire the movements 
which before they had not. As to the former, it is evident to me that 
it must be attributed to God Himself, who in the beginning created 
matter along with motion and rest, and ever since has preserved these 
in the same quantity. For, though motion is nothing but a mode in the 
thing which is moved, yet it is of a definite amount that 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 309 
--><A NAME="p309"></a> 
remains constant for the whole universe, though it varies in regard to 
the several parts." This constancy the author connects with God's 
attribute of Immutability. He continues: "Whence it follows that it is 
most consonant to reason for us to suppose that God always preserves in 
the world just so much motion as He impressed on it at its first 
creation." To the soul Descartes allows an activity of its own, but 
subject to certain qualifications which he fails definitely to express; 
for he wavers in his view as to the innateness of ideas, and as to the 
power of intellect to form its own notions on the occurrence of 
sensible experiences; while he clearly commits himself to the argument 
that a God must exist, because only as a gift from Him could finite 
intellect possess its idea of the infinite.<p>
A disciple of the master -- namely, Geulinx, carries his principles to 
the extreme of rendering both body and soul passive subjects under the 
Divine hand, denying as well the influence of soul upon body -- which 
Descartes allowed -- as that of body upon soul. His doctrine in brief 
is, "Secondary causes have no activity of their own" -- <i>Causae 
secundae non agunt</i>.<p>
Another Cartesian, somewhat more moderate, is Malebranche,<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> who 
quite denies all activity proper to matter, and goes near to making the 
soul inactive, but saves himself in a sort of mistiness of expression. 
He fully agrees with his master that all the movement which is to be 
found in things material is from God, but does not appear to care 
<!--
310 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p310"></a> 
much for the addition that the sum-total of motion was communicated at 
the first Creation; while as to the soul he allows it only one mode of 
immediate intuition -- namely, self-consciousness, all other objects 
being known to it "through the medium of ideas," which are derived from 
the intimate presence of God to the mind. It is by his express 
repudiations that Malebranche saves himself from the charge of some 
awkward inferences which might be drawn out of his principles in favour 
of pantheism, and of a direct vision of God in Himself. No doubt he was 
a pious, well-meaning man, but often not a wise one; and his system 
cannot be maintained in anything like its substance.<p>
Among our English philosophers many in past, and even in present days, 
must be ranked with the occasionalists as regards material bodies. 
Cudworth's remark is good as far as it goes,<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> "that it seems not so 
agreeable to Nature, that Nature, as a distinct thing from the Deity, 
should be quite superseded, or made to signify nothing, God Himself 
doing all the things immediately." Clarke was openly an occasionalist 
in respect to matter; Locke sets the question aside as not properly 
coming in his way, yet describes material impulse as the mere transfer 
of impressed motion.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> Reid and Stewart decidedly tend to 
occasionalism. The former says:<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> "Whether the Creator acts 
immediately in the pro<!--
CAUSALITY. 311 
--><A NAME="p311"></a>duction of events in the natural world, or by subordinate 
intelligent agents, or by instruments that are unintelligent -- these I 
suppose to be mysteries placed beyond the limits of human knowledge. 
The active power of which alone we can have any distinct conception can 
be only in beings that have understanding and will. Power to produce 
any effect implies power not to produce [a confusion between power in 
general and power of choice]; we can conceive no way in which power may 
be determined to one of these rather than to another in a Being that 
has no will." "We are unable to conceive any active power to be exerted 
without will. The only distinct conception I can form of an active 
power is that which is an attribute in a Being, by which he can do 
certain things if he wills. This is, after all, only a relative 
conception. It is relative to the effect and to the will producing it. 
Take away these and the conception vanishes. They are the handles by 
which the mind takes hold of it. When they are removed our hold is 
gone. If any man, therefore, affirms that a Being may be the efficient 
cause of an action which that Being can neither conceive nor will, he 
speaks a language which I do not understand. It seems to me, then, most 
probable that such things only as have some degree of understanding and 
will can possess active power; and that inanimate Beings must be wholly 
passive. Nothing we perceive without us affords us any good ground for 
ascribing active power to any inanimate Being: and everything we can 
discover in our own constitution leads us to think that active 
<!--
312 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p312"></a> 
power cannot be exerted without will and intelligence." The 
consequence of this opinion, which we often find re-affirmed by English 
writers, is that though science were to reduce all sensible phenomena 
to their laws, it would, as Reid himself remarks, only assign the rules 
according to which some cause works, but it would not prove that cause 
to be matter itself.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> Stewart at first sight seems to go further 
than Reid, and positively to assert occasionalism in regard to matter; 
for he affirms,<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> that "<i>power, force, energy</i>, and 
<i>causation</i> are all attributes of mind, and can exist in mind 
only:" but a closer inspection of the context will show that his 
meaning may be to say, as Reid does, that we know no force but that of 
will, and that the phrase, "material force," is addressed only to our 
ignorance, on the strength of an obscure analogy between will and 
bodily movement. Distinguishing "metaphysical or efficient causes" from 
"physical," the latter of which means only constancy of antecedent to 
consequent, he maintains that physical science has to do only with 
"physical causes," and that "we know nothing of physical events but the 
laws which regulate their succession." Soon afterwards, if his words 
are to be taken literally, he distinctly contemplates the 
<i>possibility</i> of matter being an efficient cause; for speaking of 
the popular rejection of <i>actio in distans</i>, he says: "That one 
body may be the efficient cause of the motion of another body placed at 
a distance from it, I do by 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 313 
--><A NAME="p313"></a> 
no means assert; but only that we have as good reason to believe that 
this may be possible as to believe that any one natural event is the 
efficient cause of another." With the examples now given we may suppose 
the doctrine of occasionalism to have been sufficiently illustrated, so 
that its meaning and the reasons for it are clearly before the mind.<p>
(b) The next theory to be considered, while retaining the name, 
virtually abolishes the notion of causality altogether; and Hume is the 
prime representative of this doctrine. The truth about his theory may 
be conveyed in three statements: (i.) First, he sometimes argues as 
though he were going on the supposition of real efficient causality, 
and labours to prove merely that causality is known to us by its 
effects alone, while its inmost nature cannot be penetrated by our 
methods of inquiry. We get no insight into the mode of causality, how 
it is that agents work, and why their effects are what they are. With 
this assertion we very largely agree. (ii.) Secondly, he argues that 
from <i>single experiences</i> of any kind we have no "impression of 
power," and hence can have no valid "idea" of it from this source; but 
after <i>frequent experiences</i> of similar sequences, custom produces 
in us a feeling" or an "impression of power." (iii.) Thirdly, he 
teaches that this idea of power does not carry us beyond the knowledge 
of invariable sequence; it does not give us efficient causality; we 
have no notion of one thing literally acting by its influence upon 
another. Mill tries to improve on this doctrine, but not with much 
success; both authors deny 
<!--
314 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p314"></a> 
causality in its proper sense. The details of their criticism, very 
important for the right understanding of much modern thought, but too 
long for the body of this chapter, may be found in the first of the 
notes at the end of it; they require a little patient reading, but not 
very deep thought.<p>
(3) The proposition which has now to be proved must be reduced to its 
most generalized conditions by abstraction from all those connected 
questions, each of which opens out a field of endless controversy. It 
can be so detached. We can leave out, for instance, the consideration 
how created agents act, whether immediately by their substance or 
through really distinct faculties; and whether any effects from created 
causes are new substances, or only modifications in pre-existing 
substances. Again, we can omit the extremely difficult problem of 
isolating any case so as to get precisely this as cause and that as 
effect: for every case that we can select, no matter how simple in 
appearance,, is sure to contain more complexities than we can well 
unravel. Not to take the simplest example, but to take one which, for 
the ordinary mind, would seem simple enough, let us suppose a drunkard 
sleeping out in the field at night, bringing on a very severe attack of 
pneumonia, and dying. His friends would say variously, and with great 
assurance, "it was all owing to the drink," "to the cold night air," 
"to the misfortune of sleep having come on," "to the severity of the 
inflammation," "to delay in sending for the doctor," "to having 
summoned Dr. A. instead of Dr. B." The fact is, the process has many 
<!--
CAUSALITY 315 
--><A NAME="p315"></a> 
steps of successive causes and effects, and to follow them all out in 
detail baffles human skill.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> After having given a few specimens of 
the particulars which might make our path a thorny one, we return to 
our declaration that we undertake to show, only in most general terms, 
that in this world of real changes there must be efficient causes to 
bring them about, else evolution or development, and decline or 
retrogression, would give place, if to anything, then to a dead level 
of perpetual sameness.<p>
(a) We begin with two uncontrovertible assertions, that there are real 
changes in our universe, and that there must be for these a sufficient 
reason or cause, wherever that cause may reside. To declare with the 
Eleatics that change is nothing, is absurd, and it is only an extreme 
of Hume's<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> unreasonableness which can account for his words: "We can 
never demonstrate the necessity of a cause to every new existence, or 
new modification of existence, without showing at the same time the 
impossibility there is that anything can ever begin to exist without 
some productive principle. Now, that the latter proposition is utterly 
incapable of a demonstrative proof, we may satisfy ourselves by 
considering that all distinct ideas are separable from each other, and 
as the ideas of cause and effect are evidently distinct, it will be 
easy for us to consider any object to be non-existent this moment and 
exist the next, without conjoining to it the 
<!--
316 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p316"></a> 
distinct idea of a cause or productive principle. The separation, 
therefore, of the idea of a cause from that of a beginning is plainly 
possible for the imagination, and consequently the actual separation of 
these objects is so far possible, that it implies no contradiction or 
absurdity."<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> For it is a principle which Hume adopts, that what is 
conceivable is possible.<p>
To those who instead of a mechanical association of units, called 
ideas, believe in man's power of rational insight into objective truth, 
it is clear that the only sufficient account of real change is what we 
designate by the term "efficient causality." Whatever before was not, 
and now begins to be, owes its being to something other than itself. 
The otherness may not be complete, but at least it is partial, for even 
an immanent agent under the aspect of its power to produce an effect is 
distinguished from the same agent under the aspect of its receptivity 
of that effect in itself a subject, and from the effect received. No 
real act is without real effect, though the effect be identical with 
the act. All science depends on holding these principles, and not only 
all science in the grander meaning of the word, but likewise in the 
meaning of all genuine knowledge.<p>
The dynamic aspect of the world is, therefore, as real as the static; 
the universe presents problems of kinetics as well as kinematics. We 
must admit something which is as truly an agent as it is a Being, 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 317 
--><A NAME="p317"></a> 
which acts as truly as it is. Where this agency is we leave an open 
question for the present; but a real agency we prove to exist.<p>
In support of the universal recognition of efficient causes Reid 
appeals to the unmistakeable tokens of conviction among mankind.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> 
"The arguments which I have adduced," he says, "are taken from these 
five topics: That there are many things which we can affirm and deny 
concerning power with understanding: That there are in all languages 
words signifying not only power, but signifying among other things that 
empty power, such as action and passion, cause and effect, energy, 
operation, and others: That in the structure of all tongues there is an 
active and a passive form in verbs, and a different construction 
adapted to these forms, of which diversity no account can be given but 
that it has been intended to distinguish action from passion: That 
there are many operations of the human mind familiar to every man come 
to the use of reason, and necessary in the ordinary conduct of life, 
which imply some degree of power in ourselves and in others: That the 
desire of power is one of the strongest passions of human nature." One 
always regrets that Reid, who says so much which is good about the real 
power of created will, should also have said so much against any real 
power proper to material things, and should have lamented that<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> 
"even the great Bacon seems to have thought that there is a <i>latens 
processus</i>, as he 
<!--
318 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p318"></a> 
calls it, by which natural causes really produce their effects."<p>
The argument for the bare fact of efficient causality must be completed 
by the settlement of a question which arises as to the immediacy of the 
perception in regard to the abstract principle. The inquiry is, whether 
the general principle, that every new reality must have a cause, is 
immediately evident, or whether it is, as Mill contends, an induction 
from experience. To save himself from the vicious circle of grounding 
Induction on the principle of Causality and the principle of Causality 
on Induction, Mill<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> distinguishes a <i>natural</i> knowledge of the 
principle which precedes the inductive proof, from the scientific 
knowledge which is the outcome of that proof. In behalf of the need of 
an induction, Mill argues from the fact of the very tardy acquiescence 
of mankind in the reign of law, or in the belief that things do not 
happen at hazard, but all according to definite causation. We reply 
that rude peoples are not so much astray about the abstract principle, 
that whatever happens must have a cause, as about its application. They 
see so much happen for which they cannot account, and they are so 
accustomed to the freaks of their own free-will, that they overlook the 
need of an account to be rendered for every event, or they find that 
account in a cause called Fate, which is the impersonation of the 
freakish Will. But whatever may be the explanation of the blunders of 
the incompetent, when we rationally consider the principle of 
causality, we have a right 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 319 
--><A NAME="p319"></a> 
to pronounce it immediately evident, or if we like to resolve it into 
elements, we may.<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> It contains the propositions: Every thing must 
have a sufficient reason why it is rather than is not, and why it is 
thus rather than otherwise: The only sufficient reason for a real 
change is efficient causality: Therefore every real change has an 
efficient cause. So worded the principle escapes the charge of 
tautology, to which it is liable as long as it stands in this shape, 
"Every effect must have a cause."<p>
(b) So far we may claim to have established that we do find efficient 
causality at work in the world; the next point we have to prove is, 
that this causality is not simply Divine, but that creatures act. We 
will begin the inquiry by another question about immediacy, Have we any 
immediate perception of created causality itself, or is it all at best 
a matter of inference? The answer depends largely on our way of 
talking, and is akin to the difficulty found by logicians in 
discriminating what they call immediate inferences from inferences in 
strict syllogistic form. At least it may be affirmed that man has 
immediate consciousness of his own activity, as that of which he is the 
cause, in some of the acts of the will. If it is objected that 
consciousness testifies to facts, but not to what philosophers often 
call the how of facts, we deny the assertion to be universally true, 
otherwise we should not know some acts to be pleasant, others 
unpleasant, some to be according to our will, others against it. When 
it is said that such truths 
<!--
32O TRANSCENDENTAL REING. 
--><A NAME="p32"></a> 
as the spirituality, the immortality, the substantiality of the soul 
are matters not of direct consciousness, but of inference therefrom, 
there can be no intention to place every piece of information about the 
thinking principle in the position of an inference: at least some 
characters are immediately revealed. Notably our own causal activity is 
a fact of which we are directly aware; and if we single out the act of 
free choice especially, it is not that we wish to exclude all other 
acts from the list of these which give immediate testimony to our 
causality; but we fix upon the most prominent of our own free acts as 
pre-eminently establishing the point in question. Nor do we think it 
any objection to the immediacy of the testimony, that it needs some 
reflective thought explicitly to recognize what causality is, how it 
differs from mere sequence, what it is to be the principle whence 
causality flows; and so forth. Even the three primary principles about 
Being and Not-Being need reflexion explicitly to formulate them, and, 
as we were made painfully to perceive in the chapter on Being, the 
primitive notions can be described only by the employment of great 
care. Under fair allowances for immediacy we have some immediate 
knowledge of causal activity as a fact in the concrete.<p>
(c) Having found at least one case of efficient causality in created 
agents, we have now to prove it for other cases. Anticipating results, 
we may divide man's experienced proof of efficient causality into a 
succession of certainties, all deserving their name, but varying in 
rank. (i.) His highest certainty is 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 321 
--><A NAME="p321"></a> 
about the activity of his own intellect and will. Coleridgians insist 
mainly on the latter, and say that only by the consciousness of an 
originative will within us can we be secure against Hume. (ii.) Man's 
certainty next in degree, is that he exercises some causality in 
movements of his own body -- in some if not in others; and this truth 
holds in spite of Reid's assertion,<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> "For anything I know to the 
contrary, some other Being may move my hand as often as I will to move 
it." (iii.) Man is sure that other bodies act on his, and also (iv.) 
that they act <i>inter se</i>, one on another, though knowledge of the 
fact depends on their action upon his own body.<p>
All our task will be accomplished if we can give valid reason for 
holding that material substances are real agents. We may begin with a 
difficulty that applies equally to acts of our own will, though we did 
not mention it when speaking on that subject: for its plausibility is 
greater with regard to the agency of external bodies, about which we 
are now to treat. Suarez, in defence of his peculiar theory that action 
is modally distinct from its own intrinsic term, or that the product of 
the action has the action itself for its really distinct mode, allows 
that God might absolutely bring about these acts without the 
concurrence of the faculties in which they inhere.<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> "God might 
Himself alone produce these acts, so far as they are certain qualities, 
without the active concurrence of the faculties, whether He produced 
them as forms inherent in the faculties, or not; for this latter point 
is quite 
<!--
322 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p322"></a> 
another inquiry. Hence it is not of their essence that these qualities 
should depend on the faculties." Having allowed that this opinion has 
the support of so respectable an authority as Suarez, we deny its force 
against the doctrine we here maintain. For to pass over what we have 
already shown, that whatever might have been, yet <i>de facto</i> 
consciousness testifies the origin of our thoughts and volitions to be 
from our own causal agency, and testifies against the mere infusion of 
them into our passive soul; we single out especially the effects that 
take place in material bodies, and observe that at best the theory of 
Suarez would go to show that by miracle God might work the results 
which we call natural. Now we do not dispute that God might, by His 
sole power supply much of the causal influence which brings about 
physical changes in matter; but that He commonly does so is a 
supposition derogatory to the Divine attributes. We are at least half-
way on to pantheism if we make all material action Divine; furthermore, 
as we know things only by their activities, there is no reason why we 
should assert those inert masses if we suppose them to be nothing but 
idle occasions of the Divine operations. As Berkeley says, "Nobody will 
miss them," so let them go. Leibnitz and many others declare that the 
very notion of a Being with no activity native to it is a 
contradiction, and that there can be no <i>actus primus</i> without an 
<i>actus secundus</i>. At any rate God's works have a perfection of 
their own which marks them as worthy of their Maker; hence the 
maxims:<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup>
<!--
CAUSALITY. 323 
--><A NAME="p323"></a> 
<i>Natura non deficit in necessariis</i> -- "Nature fails in no 
requisite;" and <b>ouden mat&ecirc;n</b> -- "Nothing is without a 
purpose," as matter would be, if it were so absolutely inert as to be 
in a condition of simple do-nothingness. It may be said that these 
maxims are theological. This is not exclusively true, for they have a 
foundation on the generalizations of experience; but they are also 
theological, and under this aspect they just meet present exigences. 
For the occasionalists against whom we are contending appealed 
precisely to God in their theory that the efficiency, which we want to 
prove to be in nature, was not from nature, but from its Author: and it 
is on considerations which concern the requirements of Divine wisdom 
that we frame our reply.<p>
We give the argument from St. Thomas: "If effects are not produced by 
the activity of creatures, then they cannot manifest to us the powers 
of creatures; for it is only by means of the activity which, coming 
forth from the cause, finds lodgment in the effect, that the effect can 
show us what the power of the cause is. Now the nature of an agent is 
known from its effects, only so far as its power is thereby known; the 
power being in accordance with the nature. If, therefore, creatures 
exert no activities that produce effects, it follows that never could 
the nature of a creature be known by its effects: thus we lose all 
natural science, which proceeds chiefly by the method of demonstrating 
causes from their effects."<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup><p>
The proof admits of a further development on 
<!--
324 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p324"></a> 
these lines: it is a matter of our inmost conscious experience that 
our own bodies act: therefore matter has certain inherent activities; 
therefore it is reasonable to assert the activity also of lifeless 
matter. If in the living body matter is not the mere passive recipient 
of the soul's causality, but has a causality due to itself, then the 
theory that matter is essentially inert, in the sense of wholly 
inactive, falls to the ground.<p>
Here then we end our argument for the broad fact of natural causality: 
but we must repeat that it is only the broad fact for which we have 
been contending, not for the mode of operation. Mr. S. Hodgson must be 
trusting most deceptive guides when he affirms, in the teeth of plain 
facts, that "the schoolmen assumed the general conception of causal 
energy as equivalent to a knowledge of what causal energy consists in;" 
and that Hume made a strong point against them when he showed we have 
no knowledge of what is the nature of force. The schoolmen were well 
aware of the distinction between the <i>that</i> and the <i>how</i>, 
and did not stake the fate of the first inquiry on the success of the 
second. Rather it was those who were bent on penetrating the <i>how</i> 
who fell away from the common-sense view. To account for his defection, 
Malebranche says:<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> "The chief reason is the inconceivability of the 
thing: try as I may, I cannot find a representation in my mind of what 
this power is which is commonly attributed to creatures." Hume also 
insists much on the same inconceiva<!--
CAUSALITY. 325 
--><A NAME="p325"></a>bility to justify his scepticism. The difficulty is admitted, but 
fortunately it need not be encountered, else we should be in a hopeless 
state, for it has puzzled the most penetrating genius. Laplace declared 
that "the nature of force is and ever will be a mystery." But he did 
not on that account deny force, or renounce all knowledge of its 
nature: he held that we can determine "its actions and its effects." 
The <i>mystery</i> of essence and the <i>mystery</i> of the 
<i>substratum</i>, were the stalking-horses behind which adversaries 
attacked essence and substance; and under the same shelter of 
<i>mystery</i> they attack causality. We allow a mystery, but likewise 
contend for something plain to the ordinary intelligence. We are not to 
be driven from this plain truth by the cry of mystery. Hence we are 
struck more by the incompetence than by the argumentative skill of a 
man who will tell us, like Mill,<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> "that the notion of causation is 
deemed by the school of Metaphysics most in vogue at the present 
moment, to imply a <i>mysterious</i> and most powerful tie, such as 
cannot, or at least, does not exist, between any physical fact and that 
other physical fact on which it is invariably consequent, and which is 
properly termed its cause; and that thence is deduced the supposed 
necessity of ascending higher into the essences and inherent 
constitution of things, to find the true cause, the cause which is not 
only followed by, but actually produces the effect." Unmistakeably in 
our intellectual ascent we can go as high as "the cause which certainly 
produces the effect:" but we 
<!--
326 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p326"></a> 
do not pretend to have risen to that upper region of the mysterious; 
we content ourselves with what we can claim to be securely sure of, 
namely, real efficiency. Kant is another opponent of the reality of our 
notion about causality; but as this is not the place to open out the 
whole question of his <i>a priori</i> categories, we must content 
ourselves with the assertion that what he regards as a mental form, we 
have proved to be the idea of a reality. We have shown that there are 
real causes effecting real changes among things in themselves. Even 
Kant has confessed as much. For, greatly to the disconcertment of his 
friends, he argued that we know the existence of <i>noumena</i>, or of 
things in themselves, <i>because they are the efficient causes of 
impressions upon our organs</i>. No special pleading has been able to 
conceal this inconsistency in Kant's theory. Whereas he ought to have 
regarded the category of causality as not valid beyond subjective 
phenomena, he has unguardedly applied it to things in themselves, as 
though they were knowable as real causes. He was right in so arguing, 
but the argument implies the renunciation of his theory about the 
categories. And as we are on the subject of differences of meaning in 
the use of terms, it may prevent useless cavils if we add, that in 
defending the reality of created force, spiritual and material, we take 
the word on our own interpretation of it, not in any or all of the 
interpretations which various authors have given. Hence many an 
adversary will be saved a deal of misdirected efforts, if he puts aside 
his own notion of what force ought to mean, and investi<!--
CAUSALITY. 327 
--><A NAME="p327"></a> gates whether our sense is not vindicated by our arguments.<p>
(4) While we do not pretend to clear up many of the obscurities which 
beset the question of causality, at least we may give explanations of 
some current phrases, and so dispel certain mists that unnecessarily 
are allowed to confuse the view.<p>
(a) "The effect is like its cause." How, then, have the same 
philosophers who adopt this principle, divided causes into univocal and 
equivocal, the univocal being those in which like produces like, as 
when living things produce their offspring, and the equivocal being the 
opposite to univocal? The whole account seems preposterous, and has 
proved a scandal to more than one weak brother in the philosophic 
fraternity. If an artist carves the figure of some animal whose name is 
a reproach when applied to man, are we justified in quoting to him the 
maxim, "The effect must be like its cause"? All the difficulty arises 
from taking cause and effect in the rough, instead of in their proper 
analysis. What we ought to look to is the precise causality --that and 
nothing more -- which the artist has exercised. We find that he did not 
produce his own materials, nor did he expend upon them every variety of 
his causal powers, still less his whole self; yet he did exert upon 
them a certain causality, or rather a countless succession of 
causalities, which are identified with his total effect upon the 
materials, and therefore it would be strange indeed if this causality 
were not like the effect. Though the causality may not always be such 
as to indicate 
<!--
328 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p328"></a> 
the full nature of the agent, it must always be in conformity to that 
nature: no agent can effect anything quite out of character with 
himself or itself. This is the substantial meaning of the principle we 
are explaining, and the meaning evidently conveys a truth in flat 
contradiction to Hume's error. He said that for aught we can determine 
<i>a priori</i>, anything may produce anything, and events may succeed 
quite at random.<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup> "As all objects which are not contrary are 
susceptible of a contrary conjunction, and as no real objects are 
contrary [the only contraries with Hume being <i>existence</i> and 
<i>non-existence</i>], I have inferred from these principles, that to 
consider the matter <i>a priori</i>, anything may produce anything, and 
that we shall never discover the reason why any object may or may not 
be the cause of any other, however great or however little the 
resemblance may be betwixt them. This evidently destroys the reasoning 
concerning the cause of thought or perception. For though there appears 
no manner of connexion betwixt motion and thought, the case is the same 
with all other causes and effects." A man to whom causality is mere 
succession of ideas without reasonable objectivity and without any 
efficiency, may easily acquiesce in the conclusion that anything may be 
the cause of, that is, be constantly followed by, anything. Still, if 
Hume can show that there are "no real opposites," he will have gained a 
decided point in his favour: and, moreover, he may seem to be able to 
claim some support from us, 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 329 
--><A NAME="p329"></a> 
who have laid down such doctrines as that evil is not a thing, that 
impossibility is nonentity, and that all Being is true. Now, if these 
teachings are correct, and especially if Being is essentially true, the 
proposition that truth cannot contradict truth may be turned into Being 
cannot contradict Being. The inference is that there are no real 
opposites, and that the only opposition is, as Hume says, between 
existence and non-existence: hence no real opposition between any cause 
and any effect, and so far at least "anything may produce anything." In 
reply, let us recall what our doctrine has been. We have taught not 
that nothing evil is real, but that the evil <i>qua</i> evil, might be 
reduced to the idea of a privation. An illustration used was that a 
cancer is a real evil to man's body, but that yet the cancerous growth 
in itself, as an existence, is not evil; its progress is all very well 
for the cancer. The evil springs from the relationship; man and cancer 
have not got sufficient powers to enter upon terms of mutual 
accommodation, and the good fortune of the cancer results in 
deprivation to man. Two finite perfections may be such as to be 
essentially opposed, and mutually exclusive; but the opposition comes 
of the finiteness of one or other, or both, not of their perfection as 
such. Similarly, our explanation of impossible combinations between 
finite Beings, each of which was true in itself, left ample room for 
contradiction, and positive contradiction, in falsely asserted 
conjunctions. When then we, against Hume, maintain that between certain 
causes and certain effects, the opposition may be such as 
<!--
330 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p330"></a> 
to warrant the argument <i>a priori</i> that certain causes cannot 
have certain effects, we speak of an opposition between realities. Such 
opposition we may call real, however true it may be that opposition 
implies contradiction, and a contradiction is a nonentity, or the 
intrinsic impossibility of actualization. So far as no cause can give 
what it has not got, by producing something wholly opposed to its 
nature, which furnishes the law of its activity, we are right in the 
statement that effects must resemble their causes to the extent in 
which these causes are productive of the effects; but we must be 
careful to note, if we can, what precisely is this extent.<p>
To sum up results: nothing gives what it has not got: nothing can act 
in a way quite unlike its own nature: therefore every activity must 
have a certain likeness to the agent. Now the effect, so far as it is 
the effect of this particular agent, is only that agent's activity as 
received into some subject: in this sense, and not in some mysterious 
sense which no one can exactly make out, every effect is like its 
cause. The likeness must be recognized simply in the way we have 
pointed out, not by trying to make a drawing of it, in any other manner 
that is unavailing. The case is analogous to the likeness of knowledge 
to its object; consider what true knowledge must mean, and then observe 
that likeness expresses the relation; do not try to paint the likeness.<p>
(b) "The cause is prior to its effect" -- <i>Prius est esse quam 
agere</i>. To the bucolic intelligence the statement wouki seem 
obvious, and the agricultural 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 331 
--><A NAME="p331"></a> 
labourer would quote in proof of it his spades, hoes, scythes, and 
ploughs, which have to be made before they can be used. The whole 
substantial thing exists at least before many of its acts; still it has 
other acts not usually taken into account, which in point of time are 
as early as the substance. As far as we can see, a newly created piece 
of matter would be created gravitating; and, indeed, if we look at 
action, not as the production of new "forms," but as attraction and 
repulsion, it seems questionable whether the elements ever do anything 
else than act with one equal intensity from beginning to end, all 
difference in effects being due to differences in the balance of 
opposing forces, and in their respective distances. We are told that a 
weight on a table, though it does no work, gravitates all the time, and 
must have its downward tendency checked by an antagonist pressure 
upwards. We are almost quite in the dark as to the mode of action; but 
it is a wholesome reminder to be told not to be too free in speaking of 
causes issuing from potency into act, or of an effect being <i>in 
fieri</i> and <i>in facto esse</i>, in process of production and a 
product. What is taken as the first issuing forth of activity may be 
only the first release of that activity into open manifestation, and 
what is taken as the process of one effect is often the succession of 
many different effects. Here once more the case is presented in which 
we must be on our guard against taking a series of causations for one 
simple causation. If the fire is considered as the cause, and the 
condition of being cooked as the effect, then it 
<!--
332 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p332"></a> 
looks as though the effect on a round of beef was a long time in 
coming -- quite an illustration of the difference between <i>in 
fieri</i> and <i>in facto esse</i>. But if we examine the process more 
accurately, each factor of the causation is found to be synchronous 
with each factor of the effect. Hence the maxim, <i>Causa in actu et 
effectus in actu sunt simul</i>. It is not, then, in the <i>order of 
time</i>, but in the <i>order of nature</i> that the cause, acting 
<i>qua cause</i>, must be prior to its effect. Not that with Lewes we 
may make the effect the mere sum-total of the <i>causal agents</i>: for 
besides the agents there must be their agencies, real issuings forth of 
activity, and it is the sum-total of these that may be identified with 
the effect. The cook who makes a pie <i>efficienter</i>, as efficient 
cause, does not make it <i>constitutive</i>, as constituent cause, or 
we should often be cannibals at dinner. The cook is not identified with 
the cooked materials or with any part of them, but the cook's agency -- 
which is only a portion of the whole agency required -- is identified 
with her effect upon the materials. She really does produce an effect, 
and "in the order of nature" the <i>producer</i> is always prior to the 
<i>producing</i>, though in time producer and its production may 
occasionally have a simultaneous origin. Herein our doctrine differs 
from that of Lewes, who says,<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup> "Cause means <i>unconditional 
antecedence</i>. The metaphysical conception of a cause, the 
<i>producer</i> of an effect, needs limitation. We can know nothing of 
the final nexus. When we say heat produces expansion, we 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 333 
--><A NAME="p333"></a> 
simply express the <i>observed facts</i> that one heated body brought 
near a colder body begins to contract, and the other simultaneously 
begins to expand; nothing new has been <i>produced</i>, a mutual change 
in the condition of the two bodies has resulted in the 
<i>transference</i> of so much motion (heat, expansion) from one body 
to another." To effect even a transference is some sort of real 
production; but what we should give special attention to is, that on 
Lewes's showing, "invariable <i>antecedence</i>" is declared not to be 
antecedence; or causality is reduced to antecedence, on the 
understanding that the antecedence need not be antecedent. For if cause 
and effect are simultaneous, one is not before the other; there is no 
precedence where the conditioned is simply the sum of the conditions. 
Hence Lewes himself adds, "Rigorously speaking, we must limit even the 
expression of <i>necessary sequence</i>, which is held to express all 
that is known of causation. There is no <i>following</i> of effects 
from causes; but, as Sir John Herschel more truly says, the causes and 
the effects are <i>simultaneous</i>. . . . We say that the earth's 
attraction causes the weight of the apple; but the weight is the 
attraction, they are two aspects of one unknown reality." This is 
awkward in the mouth of Lewes; but we can easily accommodate ourselves 
to circumstances. We say that inasmuch as action is productively 
exercised by a substance which is the <i>causal agent</i>, the 
<i>cause</i> is prior, at least "in the order of nature," to the 
effect; but the <i>causality</i> is contemporaneous with <i>its</i> 
effect -- not necessarily with the whole result which is roughly 
denominated 
<!--
334 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p334"></a> 
effect -- for the two are the same thing under different aspects. Thus 
we at any rate are free from certain grave difficulties which beset the 
empiricist, for whom causality ought always to mean antecedence in 
time.<p>
(c) "The same cause, under the same circumstances, always has the same 
effect." An ambiguity here lies in the word "circumstances." As before, 
we found "attribute" taking the place of its opposite, "essence" or 
"substance," so that we got "essential" or "substantial attributes," 
and as we found "accidents" having their own inferior kind of 
"essences," so that we could speak of the essence of some accidental 
property being so and so; similarly now, "circumstance " comes to usurp 
the whole field to itself. At last we ask in bewilderment, "Where is 
that round which something else stands?" Now, if we take man's free 
choice as this central point, then it forms an exception to the rule, 
"The same cause, under the same circumstances, always has the same 
effect," provided we further understand cause as "agent," and not as 
"agency," as that which acts, and not as one definite mode of its 
activity. But apart from liberty of choice in all other causes the rule 
holds both of agent and of agency. It is true that exposure to what we 
may suppose the same climate is said to give different men different 
diseases, and other men no disease at all; but even if we allowed the 
exposure to be exactly the same for all, yet the men exposed differ 
vastly one from another. Hence if generically "man" and "climate" are 
the constants, 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 335 
--><A NAME="p335"></a> 
in the concrete we have not the same "circumstances." In what is 
called the "plurality of causes" -- or the doctrine that one effect may 
be due to a variety of causes, we must distinguish two things -- its 
bearing on practical science and its bearing on philosophic analysis of 
what precisely causality is. On practical science the result may often 
be very prohibitive, because, <i>at least so far as we can detect</i>, 
a given effect may be due to any one of a multitude of causes. The 
obstacle is real, though its reality may be exaggerated.<sup><small><a name="n35"><a href="#n_35">{35}</a></a></small></sup> Next, in 
abstract philosophy, the case is still a difficulty. An angel, a human 
arm, or an explosive mixture may each give the same rate of velocity to 
a missile: if we identify the causality with the effect, so far it 
looks as though in each cause the causality was the same, though 
certainly the three causes were very different. The more we go into the 
details, into the several modes of producing motion, into the 
difference between agent as acting, action, and effect, the more we 
find opportunity for raising questions. And yet, after all, we may 
defend our original statement as true. For whatever may be the correct 
doctrine about the "plurality of causes,"<sup><small><a name="n36"><a href="#n_36">{36}</a></a></small></sup> that is a matter which 
affects only the  
<!--
336 TRANSCENDENTAL BEINO. 
--><A NAME="p336"></a> 
tracing back of <i>special</i> results to <i>special</i> causes; it is 
an empirical process, an investigation <i>a posteriori</i>. Whereas our 
proposition is <i>general</i>, its procedure is in the reverse 
direction, from causes to effects; its truth is <i>a priori</i>. We 
affirm that given a necessary cause which has fixed laws of action, 
then if that cause exerts itself under conditions that are just alike, 
its own precise effect will be just alike. Otherwise we should have 
indeterminism in Physics, and contradiction in Metaphysics. It is 
raising quite an irrelevant issue to remark, that never, in the whole 
history of the cosmos, are exactly the like circumstances repeated; 
they approximate near enough to identity for all practical purposes.<p>
(d) "On the cessation of the cause the effect sometimes ceases, 
sometimes not." When Keats desired to have as his epitaph, "Here lies 
one whose name is writ in water," he evidently distinguished the effect 
which perishes at once from that which endures. What is it that makes 
the difference? In the world of mind, according to some, there are no 
passing effects, but all are permanently stored up in memory; such at 
least is a theory which Hamilton adopts.<sup><small><a name="n37"><a href="#n_37">{37}</a></a></small></sup> But if we take the world 
of matter, then probably our best guides are the laws of motion, 
according to which no effect ceases, except when it meets with some 
counteracting cause whereby it suffers transmutation. By the force  
<!--
CAUSALITY. 337 
--><A NAME="p337"></a> 
of gravitation waters just divided close up again; the wind 
obliterates traces on the sand; the London atmosphere eats away 
carvings on stone; and the whole question of endurance appears as one 
of the absence of opposing forces. We are not justified in saying 
positively that local movement is the only effect producible by matter; 
even in those sciences which are mathematically reducible to modes of 
motion, these modes need not be the whole effect; still the laws of 
motion seem to give us the best criterion we can find for judging about 
the nature of permanency in material effects. A German philosopher, 
Herbart, has largely used the analogy of impact between material 
particles to illustrate the process by which ideas are checked by 
ideas; but it is only an analogy and is overworked.<p>
On the whole we must admit that the saying, "On the cessation of the 
cause, the effect ceases," is only as a piece of popular philosophy, 
and that it needs to be explained, and even explained away.<p>
The axioms about causality so far discussed are typical instances; and 
what we have laid down in their regard will serve for the elucidation 
of others, such as that the "effect cannot excel its cause." 
Throughout, the principles on which we must fall back are especially 
two given by St. Thomas, that between the agent and the patient there 
must be some sort of difference, and that yet action and passion are 
one thing under different relations. "The thing under the same aspect 
cannot be both in act and in potency:" "When something effects 
<!--
338 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p338"></a> 
an alteration in itself, it is not agent and patient, mover and moved 
under the same aspect;"<sup><small><a name="n38"><a href="#n_38">{38}</a></a></small></sup>  "Action and passion are the same entity, 
and differ only according to their different relations."<sup><small><a name="n39"><a href="#n_39">{39}</a></a></small></sup> So teaches 
St. Thomas, though because of other passages,<sup><small><a name="n40"><a href="#n_40">{40}</a></a></small></sup> his meaning is not 
undisputed. In the utterance last quoted, which contains a principle to 
which we have often recurred, he is but repeating doctrine to be found 
in Aristotle, who said<sup><small><a name="n41"><a href="#n_41">{41}</a></a></small></sup> that "action and passion and motion are the 
same thing"  -- <b>pr&ocirc;ton men h&ocirc;s tou autou ontos tou 
paschein kai tou kineisthai kai tou energein leg&ocirc;men</b>. Mr. 
Wallace<sup><small><a name="n42"><a href="#n_42">{42}</a></a></small></sup> thus translates the whole passage: "Let us in the first 
place agree to regard in our discussion the words passive impression, 
movement, and activity as identical: for movement is a species of 
realized activity, though it is imperfect. Now in every instance things 
are impressed and set in movement by something which is capable of 
producing an impression, and which exists in full activity. And thus an 
impression is in one sense made by the like, in another sense by the 
unlike; for it is as unlike that anything suffers an impression; after 
the impression has been made, it is converted into like." In this sense 
it is said that while the effect must be like its cause, the agent, as 
such, must be unlike the patient, as such; and yet the agent must have 
a nature conformable or like to its own activities. 
<!--
CAUSALITY 339 
--><A NAME="p339"></a><p>
(e) "A cause is more than a condition." This saying is of a different 
type from those previously explained, and leads some people to a hazy 
and erroneous idea, that a condition may positively do something, 
without being a cause. We must try to distinguish different senses.<p>
The most pure instance of a condition is one which does nothing, but 
consists in the mere absence of an obstacle. Thus a window is a 
condition of seeing, because it does not impede the course of light; it 
may be a simple hole, as in more primitive buildings, or it may be 
glass, inasmuch as it has the negative quality of not appreciably 
obstructing the luminiferous waves. But the best glass gives no light 
of its own, as we may verify for ourselves at night, when the candles 
are out.<p>
The second case of a "condition," is one where the reality does 
something positive, but, as a cause, it is so comparatively inferior in 
rank, or so far removed from the final result as not to be reckoned 
among the causes. This is instanced by the oft-quoted relation of the 
bellows-blower to the organist. The former has positively to cause 
something, but his work is unskilled labour, and he is not the 
immediate producer of the musical sound. If we were so inclined we 
might also call the organist a condition; for he only opens the vents 
and lets the imprisoned air act on the tubes; but because it requires 
much skill to press the keys in the ways required, the actions are 
dignified with the title of principal causes. The <i>remoteness</i> of 
the organ-builders, or of the musical composer from 
<!--
340 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p340"></a> 
the actual playing at the time, would lower them to "conditions," 
though in point of <i>dignity</i> they might claim to be <i>causes</i>.<p>
A third meaning of "condition" refers to a moral agent, who is not 
simply made to act upon the fulfilment of certain "conditions," but 
chooses to act where these motives are presented. Thus, the grace of 
God is sometimes "conditioned" by certain acts on the part of man, 
though there is no obligation, not even one consequent on a promise 
given. If not the free acts only, at least the free acts especially, of 
a moral agent deserve to be styled acts dependent on conditions.<p>
We conclude that in reference to a moral agent, so far as his action is 
distinctively moral, a condition furnishes a requirement without which 
he will not act: while in reference to physical agency as such, a 
condition is either a remote or a comparatively insignificant cause, or 
else it is the absence of a possible obstacle.<p>
An <i>occasion</i> is a conjunction of causes, efficient and material. 
Those who speak of the evolution of our solar systems from a primitive 
nebula, have noticed that, not only the primitive elements of matter in 
such a nebula need to be accounted for, but that likewise their 
collocation, their arrangement, their distribution, is a distinct fact 
about them, of which some account should be rendered. Now an occasion 
answers to this collocation: it always must have a distinct cause, but 
in itself we regard it as an incident of causation, not as a cause. If 
on the occasion when a flower is ready 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 341 
--><A NAME="p341"></a> 
to scatter its seeds a high wind arises, they are dispersed all the 
further; if on the occasion when a tile falls from a roof a man is 
passing just under the spot where it falls, he is injured. Our ordinary 
practice is, to take the conjunction of two or more causes which we 
regard as practically independent, to ignore the cause or causes which 
have brought them into conjunction, and then, to speak of their 
combination as occasional. In the example of a free agent, he may 
choose his occasions because of their special fitness to his purpose, 
and they may become conditions of his action.<p>
We forbear further illustration of the maxims of causality. We fail 
indeed to explain some of the points which they suggest because our 
knowledge of the mode of causality is very limited; nevertheless, we 
are able to sustain our main proposition, which is, that we can make 
sure of real causes in the created universe.<p>
NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.<p>
(1) The promised account of the three doctrines about causality which 
are to be found in Hume, must now be given.<p>
(i.) In proof of the first of the three assertions, that often Hume 
only argues that our knowledge of causes is <i>a posteriori</i>, not 
<i>a priori</i>, it is enough to refer to the <i>Essays</i>, sect. vii. 
Part I. Here it will be seen that he is working out his principle, that 
"when we know a power we know the very circumstance in the cause by 
which it is enabled to produce the effect; so that from such knowledge 
we should be able to predict, apart 
<!--
342 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p342"></a> 
from experience, all that the power is able to effect." His arguments 
tend not to disprove real causality, but merely to show that while we 
are made aware of much real activity, yet we never penetrate into the 
secrets of its nature. For lack of the perfect knowledge of power in 
its inmost character, he renounces his claim even to the imperfect 
knowledge, which, nevertheless, he perpetually supposes. He says, for 
example, of our inner experiences, that "if by consciousness we 
perceived any tower or energy, we must know this power; we must know 
the secret union of soul and body, and the nature of both these 
substances." The assumption is more than a trifle extravagant, that 
unless a man knows all about power he knows no power at all. It is the 
old story of the "hidden essence" and the "hidden substratum," which we 
considered when treating of essence and substance; nothing is known 
because something is hidden.<p>
(ii.) Our second statement about Hume, that the "impression" of force 
or power is given by no single experience, but only by repeated 
experiences, is proved by citation from Part II. of the same Essay, 
which may be copied out with little comment; it contains the pith of 
his whole theory, and should be carefully read: "We have sought in vain 
for any idea of power, or necessary connexion, in all the sources from 
which we could suppose it to be derived. It appears that in single 
instances of the operation of bodies, we never can, by our utmost 
scrutiny, discover anything but one event following another; without 
being able to comprehend any force or power, by which the cause 
operates; or any connexion between it and its supposed effect. The same 
difficulty occurs in contemplating [singly] the operations of mind on 
body, where we observe the motion of the latter to follow on the 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 343 
--><A NAME="p343"></a> 
volition of the former, but are not able to observe nor conceive the 
tie which binds together the motion and the volition. The authority of 
the will over its own faculties and ideas is not one whit more 
comprehensible." After examining the operations of outer body upon 
outer body, of will upon our own body, and of will upon the mind's own 
actions, he pronounces that, "on the whole, there appears not any one 
<i>instance of connexion</i> which is conceivable by us." So he repeats 
the old blunder of confounding together the knowledge of a fact, and 
the knowledge of its inmost nature; because he cannot conceive the 
<i>how</i> (<b>dioti</b>) of the connexion, he cannot affirm the 
<i>that</i> (<b>hoti</b>) -- that there is a connexion. Hence he 
continues, "All events seem entirely loose and separate; one event 
follows upon another, but we never can observe any tie between them." 
Then he draws his conclusion, that from <i>single experiences</i> there 
is no "impression of power," and consequently no "idea." What he fails 
to find in single instances, he next proceeds to seek and find in the 
<i>repetition of many similar instances</i>. From neglect of this part 
of the theory, some report Hume as wholly denying that we have the 
impression of power from any source. Whereas his words are clear: 
"There is nothing in a number of instances different from every 
<i>single</i> instance, which is supposed to be exactly similar, except 
only that after the repetition of similar instances the mind is 
<i>carried by habit</i>, upon appearance of one event, to <i>expect its 
usual attendant</i>, and to believe that it will exist. This connexion, 
therefore, which we <i>feel in the mind</i>, or <i>customary transition 
of the imagination</i> from one object to its usual attendant, is the 
<i>sentiment</i> or <i>impression</i> from which we form the 
<i>idea</i> of power or necessary connexion."<p>
(iii.) The third point that remains to be shown is the manner in which 
Hume arrives at no objective 
<!--
344 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p344"></a> 
knowledge of causality, strictly so called, but only at invariable 
sequence, and that in the subjective order of feelings. The passages in 
support of this interpretation are embarrassingly numerous. Let us 
begin with the following:<sup><small><a name="n43"><a href="#n_43">{43}</a></a></small></sup> "<i>Reason</i> can never show us the 
connexion of one object with another, though aided by experience and 
observations of their constant conjunction in all past instances." 
Therefore, whatever be the way in which Hume arrives at causal 
connexion, it is not by the way of reason; and that is an important 
declaration, though afterwards what it says is unsaid. "When the mind 
passes from the idea or impression of one object to the idea or belief 
of another, it <i>is not determined by reason</i>, but by certain 
principles <i>which associate together the ideas of these objects</i>, 
and unite them in the imagination. <i>Had ideas no more union in the 
fancy than objects have in the understanding</i>, we could never draw 
any inferences from causes to effects, nor repose belief in any matter 
of fact. <i>The inference, therefore, depends solely on the union of 
ideas</i>." In strict logic, he assures us, each new revision of our 
judgments should go on diminishing their probability, which was all 
they had to start with, till at last every vestige of probability is 
lost. Logically this should be; but nature is too strong for Logic, and 
the only good we get out of considering what Logic has to object 
against our way of procedure is, that it "makes the reader more 
sensible that all our <i>reasonings</i> concerning causes and effects 
are derived from nothing but <i>custom</i>; and that belief is more 
properly an act of the sensitive than of the cogitative part of our 
nature." For the result of reflexion being such that it gradually 
"reduces the original evidence to nothing," the inference is that<sup><small><a name="n44"><a href="#n_44">{44}</a></a></small></sup> 
"if belief were only a simple act of thought, without 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 345 
--><A NAME="p345"></a> 
any peculiar manner of conception or addition of force and vivacity, 
it must infallibly destroy itself." Nevertheless, since each one, 
"though he can find no error in the foregoing arguments, yet continues 
to believe as usual, he may safely conclude that <i>reasoning</i><sup><small><a name="n45"><a href="#n_45">{45}</a></a></small></sup> 
and belief is <i>some sensation</i> or <i>peculiar manner of 
conception</i>, which 'tis impossible for mere ideas and refiexions to 
destroy." Thus the reason which Hume sets over against mere modes of 
sensation or feeling, in the end is reduced to a mode of feeling; and 
the principle of causality, which reason cannot prove, is declared to 
be reasonable, because reason after all is not reason, but a kind of 
sentiment which is natural to us, and which it is useless logically to 
dispute, though logical disputation, if employed, is fatal to its 
claims. We know causality by a process which both is not reasonable and 
is reasonable: it is not reasonable, because reason is logical, and 
Logic pronounces against causality; it is reasonable, because reason is 
a kind of feeling, and we have a "feeling" of causality. If these 
exhibitions of fatuity should do anything towards making apparent the 
chaos of confusion into which Hume precipitates himself, the effect on 
the appreciation of much modern philosophy will be highly useful; for 
this last is not radically better than that of Hume which it aims at 
slightly improving.<p>
It is well that we should thus be brought across Hume's wavering 
tendency between making knowledge a matter of "natural propensity," and 
distinguishing "natural propensity" from knowledge. He says,<sup><small><a name="n46"><a href="#n_46">{46}</a></a></small></sup> "After 
the most accurate of all my reasonings, I can give no reason why I 
should assent to it; and feel nothing but a strong propensity to 
consider objects strongly under that view under which they appear to 
<!-- 
346 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p346"></a> 
me." And his final decision, given almost at the end of the First 
Book, takes this shape: "Where reason is <i>lively</i> and mixes itself 
up with some <i>propensity</i> it ought to be assented to; where it 
does not, it can never have any title to operate upon us." If some 
should think that this is only a clumsy expression of the truth, that 
ultimately we must believe because of felt conviction, they have only 
to consider the application to our present subject of causality, and 
they will see how Hume makes it the very triumph of his system, that it 
holds equally for the animals below man and for man himself. Once more 
our vouchers shall be Hume's own words. He has to explain the necessity 
of connexion, which forms part of our notion of causation; and here is 
his explanation:<sup><small><a name="n47"><a href="#n_47">{47}</a></a></small></sup> "The idea of <i>necessity</i> must be derived from 
some internal impression. There is no internal impression which has 
relation to the present business, <i>but that propensity which custom 
produces</i> to pass from one object to the idea of its usual 
attendant. This, therefore, is the essence of necessity. <i>Upon the 
whole, necessity is something which exists in the mind, not in 
objects</i>;<sup><small><a name="n48"><a href="#n_48">{48}</a></a></small></sup> nor is it possible for us ever to form the most distant 
idea of it, considered as a quality in bodies. Either we have no idea 
of necessity, or necessity is the determination of the thought to pass 
from causes to effects, and from effects to causes, according to their 
experienced union." Then he adds<sup><small><a name="n49"><a href="#n_49">{49}</a></a></small></sup> as "an invincible proof" of his 
system of explanation, that it applies to the knowledge both of man and 
beast. He is aware that this theory is of all his paradoxes<sup><small><a name="n50"><a href="#n_50">{50}</a></a></small></sup> "the 
most violent," and very much against "the inveterate pre<!--
CAUSALITY. 347 
--><A NAME="p347"></a>judices of mankind;" yet he makes bold to maintain it 
notwithstanding. In regard to causality, he asks us to believe, on the 
one side, that as far as <i>reason</i> can see, "anything may produce 
anything; creation, annihilation, motion, reason, volition" -- all 
these may arise from one another, or from any other object we can 
imagine, on the other side "we infer a cause immediately from its 
effect, and this inference is not only <i>a true species of 
reasoning</i>, but <i>more convincing than when</i> we interpose 
another term to connect the two."<sup><small><a name="n51"><a href="#n_51">{51}</a></a></small></sup> Evidently Hume has two sorts of 
reason, and the marvel about them is, that one of them is irrational 
yet valid, while the other is rational yet invalid.<p>
Of Hume's recent followers we will take only one, Mill, who felt that 
his leader's definition of cause was inadequate. The definition stood: 
"The cause is an object followed by another, and where all the objects 
similar to the first are followed by objects similar to the second;" or 
"a cause is an object followed by another, and whose appearance always 
conveys the thought of that other." Mill saw that this clumsy formula, 
so far as it provided for anything, provided only for invariable 
sequence, and invariable sequence need not be causality; hence he added 
the word "unconditional," and said that causality was "invariable and 
unconditional sequence."<sup><small><a name="n52"><a href="#n_52">{52}</a></a></small></sup> Day may have invariably followed upon 
night, without thereby proving itself the effect of the latter, for it 
is conditioned "on the existence of the sun or some such luminous body, 
and on there being no opaque medium between that body and the part of 
the earth where we are situated; these are the sole conditions, and the 
union of these, without any superfluous (?)<sup><small><a name="n53"><a href="#n_53">{53}</a></a></small></sup> circumstance, 
<!--
348 TRANSUENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p348"></a> 
constitutes the cause." All the advance which Mill here makes upon 
Hume, is that he secures attention to a completer enumeration of the 
several parts of the antecedent; but having provided for this completer 
enumeration, he leaves causality in the category of mere invariable 
sequence, without any productive power. He has pointed<sup><small><a name="n54"><a href="#n_54">{54}</a></a></small></sup> out with a 
great deal of good sense, that what we generally call "the cause," is 
only a part of it, and he adds that, adequately taken, "the cause is 
the sum-total of the conditions, positive and negative, taken together; 
the whole of the contingencies of every description, which being 
realized, the consequent invariably follows." The practical difficulty 
is to know where to stop in the attempt at such an exhaustive method of 
enumeration; for it would carry us back to the beginning of the world; 
and the fact that we must break off a long way short of this initial 
point has formed one link in the argument of some who assert that our 
propositions about nature, because we can never perfectly isolate one 
truth from its connexions, must be hypothetical, not categorical. In 
his own writings, and in the very place we are discussing, Mill 
exemplifies the incompleteness which he is condemning. For he is 
satisfied with the presence of a luminous body and the absence of an 
opaque medium, as constituting the conditions of day; whereas there is 
further need of a transmissive medium, such as the luminiferous ether. 
Again, so long as he assigns no exact meaning to the word "day," it is 
impossible to decide whether, even apart from the omission of the 
ether, he is right in calling a luminous body, and the absence of an 
opaque medium between it and the earth, rather "the cause of day," than 
day itself. Some people call it "day," even though a solar eclipse 
should 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 349 
--><A NAME="p349"></a> 
be going on between sunrise and sunset; and in that case one of Mill's 
"invariable antecedents" to the undefined consequent "day," has taken 
the liberty to vary. In a later chapter of the same book (c. xix. 
&sect; 1), Mill gives his account of day in other words: "Day is not 
the cause of night: both are successive effects of a common cause, the 
periodical passage of the spectator into and out of the earth's shadow 
consequent on the earth's rotation and on the illuminating property of 
the sun."<p>
But our main objection to Mill is that he denies our knowledge of 
efficient causality, without which his "invariable and unconditional 
sequence" can never be rationally deduced from any amount of 
experience. His improvement on the position of Hume is only one of very 
superficial appearances.<p>
(2) Brown, in his <i>Inquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect</i>, 
clearly ranges himself on the side of those who reduce causality to a 
matter of invariable sequence. In Part I. sect. i. we read, "It is the 
mere relation of uniform antecedence, so important and so universally 
believed, which appears to me to constitute all that can be 
philosophically meant in the words <i>power</i> and <i>causation</i>, 
to whatever objects, material or spiritual, the words may be applied. . 
. . A cause, therefore, in the fullest definition that it 
philosophically admits, may be said to be that which precedes any 
change, and which, existing at any time in similar circumstances, has 
always been, and will always be, immediately followed by a similar 
change. Priority in the sequence observed, and invariableness of 
antecedence in the past and future sequences supposed, are the 
elements, and the only elements, combined in the notion of a cause." In 
rejecting what he conceives to be a definition, which makes power 
something more than invariable antecedence, he 
<!--
350 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p350"></a> 
describes such power as "something mysterious, at once a part of the 
antecedence and yet not a part of it, an intermediate link in a chain 
of physical sequences, that is yet itself no part of the chain, of 
which it is said, notwithstanding, to be a link." Finally, in Part III. 
sect. v. he sets forth his view of the origin of our belief in uniform 
sequence or causation, which he attributes neither to perception nor to 
reasoning, nor to Hume's "customary association of ideas," but to a 
special intuition or instinct implanted by the Creator. "That with a 
providential view to the circumstances in which we are placed, our 
Divine Author has endowed us with certain instinctive tendencies, is as 
true as that He has endowed us with reason itself. We feel no 
astonishment in considering these when we discover the manifest 
advantage that arises from them; and of all the instincts with which we 
could be endowed there is not that which seems -- I will not say so 
advantageous, merely -- but so indispensable for the very continuance 
of our being, as that which points out to us the future, if I may so 
speak, before it has already begun to exist. it is wonderful indeed -- 
for what is not wonderful? -- that the internal revelation which this 
belief involves, should be given us like a voice of ceaseless and 
unerring prophecy. But when we consider who it was that formed man, 
then difficulty vanishes." This completes the positive statement of 
Brown's own view; but in the Fourth Part, where he proceeds to explain 
and reject Hume's theory, he ought to have been more struck by words so 
very like his own, as are these from the Inquiry, Part II. sect. vii.: 
"What stronger instance can be produced of the surprising ignorance and 
weakness of the understanding than the present? For surely if there be 
any relation among objects, which it imports us to know perfectly, 'tis 
that of cause and 
<!--
CAUSALITY. 351 
--><A NAME="p351"></a> 
effect," Yet observation and reasoning are declared incompetent to 
produce this belief: we owe it to the instinctive force of custom, in 
which "those who delight in the discovery and contemplation of final 
causes have ample subject to employ their admiration." (scct. v. in 
fine.)<p>

<a name="n_5"><a href="#n5">{5}</a></a> In the living organism the tendency to an organic end -- so clear 
that Clifford has called organization "the good " -- is much insisted 
on, as <i>Zweckstrebigkeit. Zweckmauml;ssigkast</i>.<p>
<a name="n_6"><a href="#n6">{6}</a></a> Even Reid thinks that there may be capricious acts "without all 
motive," and even "against all motive." (<i>Works</i>. p. ix.)<p>
<a name="n_7"><a href="#n7">{7}</a></a> The <i>before</i> is generally understood of time: but if any one 
believes that creation <i>ab aeterno</i> is possible, then he would 
have to accommodate the meaning of <i>before</i>, and of any other such 
term, to his own theory.<p>

quidam modus ipsius termini ilium constituens dependentem a sua cause: 
est habitudo viae ad terminum."<p>
<a name="n_10"><a href="#n10">{10}</a></a> Hence the otherness between cause and effect must be taken for 
neither more nor less than is required by the definition of active 
power, <i>principium mutationis in alio quatenus est aliud</i>, and of 
passive power, <i>principium recipiens mutationem ab alia, quatenus est 
aliud</i>.<p>
<a name="n_11"><a href="#n11">{11}</a></a> This important point, the source of so much confusion. is fully 
explained later where it will be seen how very vague is man's ordinary 
conception of <i>the</i> cause and <i>the</i> effect; where there are 
<i>many</i> causes and <i>many</i> effects. It is vague as with 
<i>many</i> logicians is <i>the</i> induction.<p>

bridge over the difficulty by a not very clear use of their distinction 
of effect <i>in fieri</i> and <i>in facte esse</i>. The effect <i>in
