THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING.</h4></center><ul><p>

(1) The true notion of the Finite and the Infinite.<p>
(2) False doctrines about the Infinite. (a) That there is no such 
thing, or at least no such notion. (b) That the notion is made up 
empirically by the addition of finite quantities. (c) That the notion 
can only be innate.<p>

Infinite especially in regard to the so-called "sum of all 
possibilities."</ul><p>
THERE is one more division of Being which we must discuss, before we 
pass on to the second book of this treatise: it is the partition of 
Being into Infinite and Finite. Straightway some readers will be 
inclined to limit our inquiry to the one aspect of space, as though 
infinity in extension were the only meaning of the term; and, 
therefore, we wish distinctly to forestall such misconception, because 
otherwise it may do a great deal to prevent our words from being 
rightly understood. We have already used "perfection" as in some way 
synonymous with Being; and if we say that our present investigation 
concerns the difference between infinite and finite perfection in 
things, we shall be conveying a much truer notion than if we spoke as 
thougb 
<!--
190 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p190"></a> 
endless space and limited space were the two special objects of our 
interest.<p>
(1) The amount of discussion that has gone on in the world about the 
finite and the infinite has been appalling, not simply on account of 
its vastness, but more still because of the bewildering nature of many 
of the speculations into which philosophers have wandered. It will, 
therefore, be well to open the discussion by as concise an account of 
the two ideas as possible, in order that the reader, having distinctly 
before his mind what he ought to mean by the finite and the infinite, 
may be enabled afterwards to take a few peeps into the wilderness of 
confusion, with a steady confidence that it need not frighten him.<p>
We began this treatise by making quite clear to ourselves the 
signification and the reality of <i>Being</i>; also we have, in various 
ways, been brought across the idea of <i>negation</i> or <i>limit</i>; 
we need only put these two elements together, and we obtain the notion 
of <i>finite Being</i>. That we ourselves are such Beings is brought 
home most certainly to our consciousness by means of reflexion, no 
matter how earnestly pantheists or monists may labour to persuade us of 
our identification with the infinite.<p>
The notion of Infinite Being is what we have next to make clear. The 
success of the effort will not depend on the number of pages over which 
we extend our account; if a few sentences amply suffice for our 
purpose, all the better, except for the danger there is lest what is 
contained within the compass of a single page should fail to secure the 
attention 
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING. 191 
--><A NAME="p191"></a> 
which it deserves, because it covers only one page. It would be 
insulting to the reader to print in large capitals, or have fingers 
drawn, pointing to the short passages that are important beyond the 
measure of their length; but we may respectfully invite careful 
advertence to the following paragraph which contains, substantially, 
all the positive doctrine that <i>General Metaphysics</i> has to 
deliver about the Infinite. In <i>Natural Theology</i> the subject has 
to be further developed with painful elaboration.<p>
Before, by denying more than a certain degree of perfection to Being we 
got finite Being; and now if we deny our previous denial, and assert 
unlimitedness of Being, we have got the idea of the Infinite, provided 
we can satisfy one peremptory condition. We must give guarantee that 
our new phrase is not self-contradictory; and this we cannot do by a 
simple inspection and comparison of the two terms, "unlimited" and 
"Being." Therefore we borrow from the treatise to which we have so 
frequently to make recourse: we take from <i>Natural Theology</i> the 
proposition that there actually exists an Infinite God, according to 
inferences that are convincingly drawn. Thereupon, what otherwise would 
have been no better than the suggestion of an idea, becomes a real 
idea, and we are assured that our conception of "unlimited Being" is 
valid. It is not a mere subterfuge like the pretence to pile finite 
upon finite till the Infinite is reached: it commits us to no assertion 
that the finite is made up of parts; it gives us simply Being which, as 
such, is not confined within any bounds. While the idea so 
<!--
192 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p192"></a> 
formed really does attain to its object, we are free to confess that 
it does so after a very imperfect mode, because it has to proceed by 
way of negation, instead of positive intuition; and though the 
negation, inasmuch as it is the negation of a negation, that is, of a 
limit, is so far turned into something positive, yet for all that it 
does not give us a direct positive conception of the infinite. Later on 
we shall allow for all shortcomings, but here we are insisting upon the 
success of our enterprise, so far as we have achieved a success. We may 
now turn to the failures of others, which will take us more time to 
consider, for error is often more roundabout than truth.<p>
(2) (a) Some of the old pagan systems, even though they do not 
explicitly deny the existence of the Infinite, implicitly deny it by 
allowing only a finite quantity of material elements and certain 
presiding spirits whose attributes declare them to be certainly finite. 
Others argue that existence means determinate existence; that all 
determination is limitation; and that, therefore, there can be nothing 
actual which is not bounded.<p>
It is, however, to the denial of our power to conceive the Infinite 
that we may more profitably turn, because the arguments on this side 
have about them a greater show of reason. Hobbes in his rough 
leviathan-like way, quite ignoring the distinction between sensitive 
and intellectual powers, thinks to crush, as with a sledge-hammer, 
man's pretence to know the Infinite.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> "Whatsoever we 
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING. 193 
--><A NAME="p193"></a> 
<i>imagine</i> is finite. Therefore, there is no <i>idea</i> or 
<i>conception</i> of anything we call infinite. No man can have in his 
mind an <i>image</i> of infinite <i>magnitude</i>, nor conceive 
infinite <i>swiftness</i>, infinite <i>time</i>, or infinite 
<i>force</i>." The identification here of imagination, of the sensitive 
picturing of infinite magnitude or velocity, with the intellectual 
conception of the infinite is very characteristic. We all allow that we 
cannot picture the Infinite; nor are we concerned to defend the 
conceivableness of an infinite magnitude, nor yet of infinity in any 
material order. Hence we quite disagree with the principles of a man 
who, as Hobbes does, acknowledges no other actuality but what he calls 
"body." He continues, "When we say anything is infinite, we signify 
only that we are not able to conceive the ends or bounds of the things 
named; having no conception of the thing, but of our inability. And, 
therefore, the name of God is used, not to make us conceive Him, for He 
is incomprehensible; but that we may honour Him. Also because 
whatsoever we conceive has been perceived first by sense, a man can 
have no thought representing anything not subject to sense. No man, 
therefore, can conceive anything, but he must conceive it in some place 
and endowed with some determinate magnitude." All contrary declarations 
"are absurd speeches, taken upon credit, without any signification at 
all, from deceived philosophers and deceived or deceiving schoolmen."<p>
While differing widely from Hobbes as to the power of intellect above 
sense, Hamilton agrees with him that we cannot conecive the Infinite. 
<!--
194 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p194"></a> 
For, he contends, "to conceive is to condition;" hence to think the 
Infinite would be to condition the unconditioned, or to destroy it. 
Nevertheless, we are bound to <i>believe</i> the Infinite, "believing 
what we cannot prove," for "we have but <i>faith</i>, we cannot 
know."<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Our attempt to conceive the Infinite reveals a mere 
impotence," "the negation of a concept," "a fasciculus of negations." 
With these assertions Hamilton would have to reconcile what he says in 
his <i>Logic</i>: "The manifestation of belief necessarily involves 
knowledge; for we cannot believe without some consciousness or 
knowledge of the belief, and consequently some consciousness or 
<i>knowledge of the object of belief</i>."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> This is rational, but it 
warns us off the statement that simply we cannot <i>know</i> the 
Infinite. Hamilton, however, is here pledged to a principle, which 
occupies a great place in his system, and which he could not forego 
without a notable retreat from a position long stoutly maintained.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> 
"The sum of what I have stated," he says, "is that the conditioned is 
that which alone is conceivable or cogitable; the unconditioned is that 
which is inconceivable or incogitable. The conditioned or the thinkable 
lies between two extremes or poles, and these extremes or poles are 
each of them unconditioned, each of them inconceivable, each of them 
exclusive or contradictory of the other. Of these two repugnant 
opposites the one is that of unconditional or absolute limitation, the 
other that of unconditional or infinite illimitation." For example, 
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING. 195 
--><A NAME="p195"></a> 
neither can we conceive a finite object which is an absolute whole or 
an absolute part, nor can we conceive an infinite object, "for this 
could only be done by an infinite synthesis in thought of finite 
wholes, which would itself require an infinite time for its 
accomplishment."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> Here precisely we catch Hamilton tripping; for 
addition of finites is not the only mode that man has of attempting the 
idea of the Infinite, since we have already given another and a valid 
mode. And this is the sufficient refutation of Hamilton, whose appeal 
to Aristotle's<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> "The Infinite is unknowable as Infinite;" "The 
Infinite is the object neither of the reasoning nor of  
<!--
196 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p196"></a> 
the perceptive faculty," will not avail him against the fact that 
mankind have actually hit upon a means of conceiving the Infinite, 
which manifestly does attain to the Infinite itself -- to the whole 
Infinite, though not to a comprehensive, exhaustive knowledge of its 
nature. No parts of it are left out, for it has no parts; still the 
conception is partial in the sense that while it seizes the whole 
object it does not wholly comprehend its nature.<p>
In behalf of Hamilton, the defence which his pupil Mansel has to make 
ought fairly to be heard, but it cannot be admitted to satisfy all 
requirements. He contends<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> that Mill's attack is beside the mark, for 
his great objection is, that Hamilton, instead of addressing himself to 
the consideration of the concrete thing which is supposed to be 
Absolute or Infinite, tries to prove "the unmeaning abstractions to be 
unknowable;" whereas the truth is that "Hamilton maintains the terms 
Absolute and Infinite to be perfectly intelligible as abstractions, as 
much so as Relative and Finite, but denies that a concrete thing can 
possibly be conceived as absolute or infinite." The abstractions are 
knowable, "in the only sense in which abstractions can be known, by 
understanding the meaning of their names;" but this meaning cannot be 
intelligently applied by man to a concrete example, because "in order 
to conceive the unconditioned existing as a thing, we must conceive it 
as existing out of relation to every thing else, as one, simple, and 
universal." The apology cannot be accepted, for the word Absolute 
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE iN BEING. 197 
--><A NAME="p197"></a> 
certainly can be applied to an object without excluding from it all 
relation; the thing may be absolute under one aspect, relative under 
another. This is clear enough in regard to finite natures: and with 
respect to God, if we pass over the Trinity as belonging to Revelation, 
all should admit that the Creator enters into <i>what are conceived as 
relations</i> to His creatures; and if many theologians refuse to call 
these relations <i>real</i>, it is only to save the appearance of 
asserting any intrinsic change within the immutable God, or any real 
dependency. Others, with the proviso, that the Divine attributes are to 
be kept inviolate, say that the relation may be called real, in order 
to signify that creation on the part of God is most really His work, 
though He does not work after our way of passing from potency to act 
and of depending on materials.<p>
As a further instance of the view, that man can form no intelligible 
notion of the Infinite, we may appeal to sermon literature, where we 
shall find Kingsley addressing these words to a Christian public:<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> 
"It is said God is infinite and absolute, and how can the finite 
comprehend the Infinite? These are fine words, but I do not care to 
understand them. I do not deny that God is infinite or absolute, though 
what that means I do not know. But I find nothing about His being 
infinite and absolute in the Bible. I find there that He is righteous, 
just, loving, merciful, and forgiving: and that He is angry, too, and 
that His wrath is a con<!--
198 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p198"></a>suming fire; and I know well enough what these words mean." It is 
not the way of Scripture to use philosophic terms to express a 
doctrine; but there are plenty of texts setting forth the 
illimitableness of the Divine Being, and these are taken by the early 
Christian Fathers to mean that God is infinite, so that literally "of 
His greatness there is no end."<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup><p>
From Hamilton's doctrine that we must believe God infinite, though we 
can form no conception of the Infinite God, onwards to Kingsley's 
opinion, that a word which for us is empty of meaning need not be held 
to declare a Divine attribute, the step is very easy. Dr. Martineau<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> 
goes further still: his view is that instad of creation out of nothing 
we must assume a sort of chaotic matter, coeval with God; and his 
answer to Spencer's argument about the unknowableness of the Absolute 
is, that it is enough to know God in His relation to His creatures. 
"True, God, so regarded, will not in the rigorous, metaphysical sense, 
be absolutely infinite. But we know no reason why He should be: and 
must leave it to the schoolmen who worship such abstractions, to go 
into mourning at the discovery." For Catholics, however, the Vatican 
Council has inserted among its decrees a passage to the effect, that 
God is a God of infinite perfection, the grounds for which doctrine may 
be found in theological treatises, <i>De Deo</i>,<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup>  
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING. 199 
--><A NAME="p199"></a> 
while the meaning of the term "infinite" must be gathered, not from 
Hamilton, or Kingsley, or Dr. Martineau, but from the philosophy which 
the Church uses.<p>
The Hamiltonian teaching about the inconceivability of the Infinite, 
which has become widely diffused in this country, and which Professor 
Huxley has lately described as having exercised a great influence 
philosophically on his youthful mind, is akin to, but not identical 
with, the Kantian distinction between the understanding, which judges 
only according to the finite categories, and the reason which has 
regulative ideas about the infinite, such, however, that we can 
speculatively assert no real object corresponding to these subjective 
ideas. Hegel, who kept the distinction between understanding and 
reason, represented the true Infinite as not other than the finite, but 
as that into which all finite objects are absorbed by the identifying 
reason. He blames Kant for separating the infinite from the finite, and 
making it a "transcendent," or an object beyond the reach of human 
intelligence. Nevertheless, Kant's antinomies or contradictions have 
largely prevailed: and they give Mr. Spencer, at the beginning of his 
First Principles, his chief grounds for asserting the basis of things 
to be the Unknowable.<p>
(b) Next to the explicit rejection of a true notion, is its implicit 
rejection by describing it in a way fatal to its essence: and such is a 
description of the Infinite to which we have already referred, and 
which makes it out to be the result of an indefinite 
<!--
200 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p200"></a> 
addition of finite quantities. This intellectual piling of Pelion upon 
Ossa to some may seem a very sublime effort: but there is much truth in 
Hegel's sarcasm against Locke on this point; that we must abandon the 
occupation not because it is too sublime, but because it is too 
tedious. Locke's teaching is<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> that "finite and infinite are looked 
on as modifications of expansion," and that "as by the power we find in 
ourselves of repeating as often as we will any idea of space, we get 
the idea of immensity, so by being able to repeat the idea of any 
length of duration, we come by the idea of eternity." Really this 
process never brings us up to the notion of infinity: it leaves us at 
some finite point, whence we look forward to a possible advance 
indefinitely extending: but this is the indefinite, not the infinite. 
At most it might be regarded as implying or presupposing the Infinite: 
for, to take the example of space, if we assert that no matter how we 
add space to space in our imagination, we can always go further in our 
additions, we do in some sort insinuate that there is an unlimited 
expanse to draw upon. If the idea does not involve self-contradiction, 
about which there are grave doubts, then our way of conceiving infinite 
space would be precisely by denying all limit to it. Locke, however, 
omits this most necessary element in the process, and contents himself 
with the indefinitely numerous parts. We are not, therefore, surprised 
to find the patrons of this system equivalently admitting that they 
have not got an idea of the Infinite, but only 
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING. 201 
--><A NAME="p201"></a> 
a substitute for it; a fact which appears in Mr. Calderwood's polemic 
against Hamilton. "It does not follow," he writes, "that since we have 
not a clear and definite knowledge of the Infinite, we can have no 
knowledge at all; we can have an indefinite knowledge of it; our notion 
of the Infinite is a notion of that to which there is always something 
beyond." To call the notion indefinite is to spoil it; only when a 
previously determinate notion of the Infinite has been formed, can we 
describe it as something such that, no matter what finite greatness we 
assign to it, "there is always something beyond." This latter 
description is a secondary account of the Infinite, and is insufficient 
in itself, though, as we shall see presently, it has some authority in 
Aristotle. Again, if we carry out the Lockian theory in Mr. Sheddon's 
fashion,<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> and compare the acquisition of the idea of the Infinite to 
climbing a mountain, which ever presents new peaks to our ascending 
energies, then, with the same author, we must admit that "the Infinite 
is for ever beyond our grasp." He " believes in its existence," but he 
destroys the notion by which the object of the belief is expressed.<p>
(e) To assert that the idea of the Infinite is innate in man, is about 
the only resort left for those who, on the one hand, firmly hold that 
he has the conception, and on the other, that his single way of 
endeavouring to acquire it for himself by experience must be through 
the addition of finite to finite. Descartes is a representative of the 
<i>a priori</i> 
<!--
202 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p202"></a> 
theory of thinking: he maintains that only the Infinite Being could 
have infused into our finite minds the knowledge of Infinity. From such 
an inference we dissent; but otherwise what Descartes has to remark 
upon the subject is not without some valuable hints. "As God alone," he 
says,<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> "is the only true cause of all that is and can be, it is 
clear that we shall be following the best course in our philosophy, if 
from the knowledge of God Himself we try to deduce the account of the 
things which He has created. Now that we may do so in security from all 
danger, we must use the caution always to bear most carefully in mind, 
that God is infinite and we altogether finite. Hence, if it should 
happen that God reveal anything to us about His own nature, for 
examples, the mysteries of the Blessed Trinity and of the Incarnation, 
we shall not refuse to believe these truths which are beyond the reach 
of our natural apprehension; nor shall we be in the slightest degree 
surprised, that both in the immensity of His own nature, and in the 
objects which He has created, there are many things which pass our 
understanding. Never shall we weary out our minds in disputations about 
the Infinite; for seeing that we ourselves are finite, it is absurd to 
suppose that we can come to conclusions about it, and it would be 
absurd in us to try to bound it within our comprehension. Therefore we 
shall not be at pains to frame answers to those who ask whether, if a 
line were infinite, the half of it would also be infinite; or whether 
an infinite number be 
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING. 203 
--><A NAME="p203"></a> 
odd or even; because it seems that no one ought to presume to have 
ideas on these questions, unless he thinks his own mind to be infinite. 
We for our part, in regard to all those objects to which, from some 
aspect, we can discover no limit, shall not indeed call them infinite, 
but shall look upon them as indefinite. For example, since we cannot 
imagine an extension so great that it cannot be greater, we shall say 
that things possible are indefinitely many." Upon this very point we 
must presently enlarge a little, and the conclusion we shall try to 
enforce is, that it seems safest to take refuge in the limitations of 
our powers, and to confess our inability even to ask properly the 
questions that are supposed to be so effective on one side of a 
controversy or on another. We have to acknowledge not only insoluble 
problems, but also problems that we cannot even state adequately. 
However, before we take up this point, we have a few words to add. The 
school of philosophers known as ontologists agree with the Cartesians 
in teaching that we begin with the knowledge of the Infinite, and 
thence descend to the knowledge of the finite; that our idea of the 
Infinite is wholly a positive idea, and that the use of the negation 
comes in when we conceive the finite as the negation of the Infinite. 
The intuition of God and the infusion of ideas, which are the 
postulates upon which the doctrines respectively rest, are both 
contrary to sound psychological principle, or to speak more simply, to 
the results of the most ordinary examination of experience. We must not 
assume means which are beyond our powers, but must account for 
<!--
204 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p204"></a> 
each notion that we have, by assigning to it such an origin as we 
discover in the workings of our own mind; and this we do when we trace 
our idea of the Infinite to a conception of Being without limit. When, 
however, we affirm that the notion of the finite comes before that of 
the Infinite, lest we should seem to deny that correlatives can be 
known apart, we must allow that a perfect perception of finite requires 
us to observe that it is the opposite of the Infinite. Still there is a 
less perfect knowledge of the finite to be had by observing the 
difference in magnitude between two finite objects. To perceive that 
one thing is smaller than another gives the idea of limitation; and 
even though the idea of illimitation as applicable to Being, do not 
then and there spring up, a sufficient contrast is at hand to produce 
the notion of the finite. It may be only later that a deliberate effort 
is made to give precision to the full contrary opposition of infinite 
to finite; then an implicit idea becomes explicit.<p>
(3) Without postulating any innate idea, we have shown how the Infinite 
can really become an object of our knowledge; but at the same time, 
because it was not an intuition, nor any fully comprehensive notion of 
the object, that we proved to be ours, but only a sort of made-up idea, 
needing the device of negativing all limit, it cannot surprise us, as 
we have just heard Descartes remark, that our conception of the 
Infinite leaves many puzzles to perplex the mind. We meet with no 
downright contradiction of our doctrine: but we do meet with 
difficulties apparently 
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING. 205 
--><A NAME="p205"></a> 
beyond our powers of perfect solution. Unsolved difficulties, however, 
cannot upset the partially acquired truths out of which they spring; 
they show only the incompleteness of the knowledge, not that the 
knowledge is not correct as far as it goes. The serious difficulties 
about the Infinite do not so much begin with the One Infinite Being: 
for He is declared to be without beginning or end, without parts or 
composition, without change or any potentiality. But when we come to 
the assertion of an infinite that has not this simple unity, but is 
supposed to be constituted by finite parts, straightway strong 
arguments appear against the validity of such a conception. St. 
Thomas<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> indeed regards it as not demonstrable that creation could 
not have been from eternity; but he distinctly says that there cannot 
be an actually infinite number or multitude, and when he puts to 
himself the explicit question, "Can the human intellect know an 
infinity of objects?" he answers that "it cannot actually know an 
infinity of objects, without numbering all the parts, and this is an 
impossibility;" and that we can know Infinity <i>in potentia</i> only, 
which is defined by Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> to be "something such that those who 
take any quantity of it have always more yet to take." This definition 
is adopted by others, being rendered by Silvester Maurus<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> as 
follows: "The infinite is that which always leaves something over and 
above, so that he who subtracts from its quantity can always take more 
and more, without ever exhausting the whole." 
<!--
206 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p206"></a> 
This quantitative infinite is quite a different thing from the 
infinite perfection of simple Being -- simple not in the sense that it 
is mere Being without determinate attributes that are mentally 
distinguishable by us, while not really so, but simple in the sense of 
uncompounded. Hence the Aristotelian definition really explains to us 
no more than the indefinite; it tells us that no finite magnitude, 
which we choose to name, will exhaust the possible extension of 
quantity; but it does not tell us that there is an infinite extension, 
nor even that infinite extension has a valid meaning. It informs us 
only that, however far we stretch quantity, we can always stretch it 
further. It gives us no more guarantee that we can predicate of it 
infinite greatness, than that we can predicate of it, by reason of its 
indefinite subdivisibility, infinite smallness, or parts infinitely 
minute.<p>
The inquiry has its direct bearing on the question of possibilities 
which we treated in the last chapter. We are asked, Is their sum-total 
infinite, or finite, or indefinite? If we reply finite, we seem to 
limit the Divine power; if we reply indefinite, we seem to be using a 
term that has reference only to human ignorance, and has no application 
to the Divine knowledge; and therefore the remaining word, infinite, is 
strongly urged upon our acceptance as the only one eligible. On the 
threshold we may remark upon a frequent assumption which requires more 
caution on the part of its friends than it generally receives. It is 
taken for granted that there must be possible an infinite production as 
the only 
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING. 207 
--><A NAME="p207"></a> 
adequate term of omnipotence. But if this principle be urged 
unqualifiedly, then omnipotence ought to be able to create another God; 
and inasmuch as what is thus implied is the height of extravagance, we 
have a right to affirm that God's power of creation has not an 
absolutely illimitable term for its object. Here is a fact which at 
least should be borne in mind while we are discussing the so-called sum 
of all possibilities. Next we may premise, that from the point of view 
of our limited capacities, "indefinitely many" forms a fair reply when 
it is asked of us, How many things God can make? Never will so many be 
assigned in numbers that He cannot produce more. We have the like 
example of an indefinitely large multitude when we consider the 
limitless subdivisibility, not perhaps of matter itself, but of 
abstract, mathematical extension. In it there is no bound assignable by 
us to the possibility of halving, and halving again, without ever 
coming to a necessary stoppage. Once more, if it be asked, how many 
thoughts will go through the mind of a person who is eternally to live 
and to be mentally active, our powers of framing an answer at least 
carry us as far as "indefinitely many."<p>
But next, when we no longer consider our limited knowledge, which 
easily allows of the indefinite, but God's knowledge which seems to 
exclude indefinity, we feel driven to say that God could give a 
definite reply to the query, "What is the sum of the possibles?" One 
great advantage which He has over us certainly will enable Him to know 
an infinite number or multitude, if that expression has an 
<!--
208 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p208"></a> 
intelligible meaning. For He does not number things successively: He 
would not have to pass over successive steps in order to reach an 
infinite number, if such a number have a real signification. To God, 
then, perhaps, the sum of all the possibilities is infinite, or rather 
infinitely infinite, in the sense that He contemplates an infinite 
number of individuals in each of an infinite number of different 
kinds.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup><p>
If by these considerations we could be driven into a plain 
contradiction, it would be fatal to our philosophy: but if from them it 
be proved only that about the infinite there are some questions which 
we cannot satisfactorily, we will not say answer, but propose, then 
that proves our knowledge to be restricted, but it does not discredit 
the little that we do understand. If objectors cannot give a 
sufficiently clear meaning to the inquiries which they are trying to 
put to us, and by which they seek to reduce us to mental confusion, 
then the limitation of their and our faculties may be betrayed; but our 
theory about possibilities may still claim to be unshaken, so far as 
ever we professed to have established a theory. It is enough, 
therefore, if we succeed in showing that the almost flippantly made 
interrogation, "What is the sum of all the possi<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING. 209  
--><A NAME="p209"></a>bilities on the supposition that their origin is in an infinite 
God?" is dark, not with "excess of light," but with defect of light. 
Perhaps it is absurd. At any rate, we shall content ourselves with 
maintaining that its want of demonstrable intelligibility in any form 
which we can give to it, is enough to bar its force as a decisive 
objection to any doctrine. Others may meet the objection directly, but 
we shall not attempt more than an indirect defence of our position 
against the attack.<p>
Recalling, as a thing to be kept in mind, our remark that omnipotence 
cannot produce another God, we fasten upon the phrase, "sum of all the 
possibilities," and demand proof that it is not incoherent in its 
terms. We do not positively affirm that it is incoherent: but we ask to 
have grave suspicions allayed which are against its coherency.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> At 
least it is an obscure combination of words, and we want more 
clearness. It seems to ask what is the summation of a series which can 
never end, and which cannot be submitted to any mathematical formula, 
and which very likely would not gain much if it could be so submitted, 
because mathematicians proceed by a convention in regard to the 
infinite, leaving it to philosophers to explain the convention if they 
can. The mathematician, as such, is quite  
<!--
210 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p210"></a> 
content to write <img src="math1.gif" width="62" height="16">, and sometimes <img src="math2.gif">, and despises ultimate 
explanation, because from his <i>hypothetical</i> point of view there 
is no need of considerations that are in the present case 
<i>absolute</i> . The theory of infinitesimals, or of absolute 
ultimates in smallness, and the theory of limits -- either of these two 
can be worked by the mathematician, who can work also with what he 
recognizes to be, and calls, surds. He can allow the symbols for 
impossible operations to enter into his workings and he ordinarily 
considers it no necessary part of his business to venture any 
philosophy about the deeper meaning of &nbsp;<img src="math3.gif" width="33" height="16">. For him the important point 
about the infinite is that no finite quantity shall ever be allowed to 
satisfy its requirements; and, as every one must see, this stipulation 
is quite consistent with the impossibility of an infinite number, for 
it exacts no more than the exclusion of a definite limit being set to 
number in a particular case. Number in this instance is not an infinite 
source actually existing, which, because it is infinite, enables us to 
draw upon it indefinitely; it is only a magnitude capable of indefinite 
expansion, but it is the expansion which gives the magnitude and 
defines its limits at each stage: we are at liberty to push these 
stages further and further, but it is a convention when the 
mathematician supposes them infinitely advanced. We should need a more 
philosophic explanation of that convention than the bulk of 
mathematicians care even to attempt, before we could accept their use 
of the terms as proof that a number literally infinite involves no 
contradiction, or is not like a 
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING. 211 
--><A NAME="p211"></a> 
surd. Mathematicians, then, at least leave us unsatisfied; professedly 
many of them ignore the philosophic difficulties underlying their 
convention. Suppose, therefore, we try for ourselves to discover what 
is the meaning of all the possibles. We find that it is often treated 
as the exhaustive term of inexhaustible power; the summation of an 
unsummable series, or better perhaps, the last number in an arithmetic 
progression, which ascends always by an increment of one, and has no 
last term; the gathering up of all into one collection in spite of the 
agreement that outside any assignable collection of the individuals, 
there should always be more left to gather. Word our account of "all 
the possibles" as we like, when we suppose them gathered into one sum, 
the cautious mind will be slow to set aside its suspicions about the 
validity of the expression. However, its defenders rest the case on 
another consideration. They allow their inability to explain infinite 
number; they appeal to the parallel instance of infinite Being, which, 
nevertheless, we admit to be actually existent, though we cannot 
comprehend it. Against such a subterfuge we have two things to say. 
First, there are proofs producible for the infinite perfection of God; 
but as God cannot create another God, there is a want of directness 
about the argument from His own infinity to show that He can create, or 
must regard as possible, an infinity of different kinds, or of 
individuals under any one kind. Second, an infinity of finite objects 
has difficulties which are avoided in the case of God who is one, 
indivisible, uncompounded, and perfectly 
<!--
212 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p212"></a> 
simple in His essence. Hence with Him there is no constituting the 
infinite out of parts: whereas the supposed infinity of possibles is 
the result of an aggregation, which gives rise to endless and hopeless 
perplexities, when inquiries are made about the results of adding or 
subtracting units. The infinite number would have to be made up of 
units, and these are elements which have furnished such difficulties 
against the number itself that it seems safe to say, they have been 
satisfactorily answered by no one; all attempt at reply rests on an 
assumption which cannot rationally be justified. De Morgan is right in 
his explanation of the numerals: they start, as he affirms, from one, 
and then proceed by the addition of a unit at each successive advance. 
Thus,<p>
<blockquote> 2 is the conventional sign for 1 + 1.<br> 3 is the 
conventional sign for 2 + 1.<br> 4 is the conventional sign for 3 + 1. 
</blockquote><p>
Hence we can never get rid of the difficulties arising from the fact 
that any number whatsoever is made up of separate units; and these 
difficulties are serious.<p>
The first Roman numerals are undisguisedly I, II, III.<p>
Here it may be worth while to point out a defect in the expression, 
that the numerals "tend to infinity." If we say that the asymptote 
tends to touch its curve, or that a polygon of ever-multiplying sides 
tends to a circle, the contact with the hyperbola and the contact with 
the circle are in themselves terms which are most clearly intelligible 
whatever may be 
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE iNFINITE IN BEING. 213 
--><A NAME="p213"></a> 
said of their being reached by the asymptote and the polygon. But if 
any one says that ever-increasing number "tends to infinity," the 
ultimate term itself here lacks the clear intelligibility which we 
admitted in the former cases. It seems rather that the very law of 
<i>number</i>,<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> or if some people prefer the word, of 
<i>multitude</i>, should he that there shall be no term to which it can 
tend as to its completion; just as it seems the law of the production 
of parallel lines, that they should always as rigorously preserve their 
distance, as if an inflexible bar held them apart. They have no law of 
nearer and nearer approach, such as is apparent in the case of the 
asymptote.<p>
The force of the above arguments will be missed if the reader forgets 
that they are purely sceptical, not dogmatic proofs against the 
possibility of infinite multitude. They insist only on the two facts -- 
that there are unsolved difficulties against such infinity, and that we 
cannot be compelled to sink these difficulties, because of some proof 
<i>aliunde</i>, that there must be an infinite number or multitude. If 
certain mathematical results seem to be against the latter assertion, 
we plead in explanation, that these results depend on <i>a priori</i> 
conventions which, at the time they were made, were not philosophically 
analysed. The results follow deductively on the convention, but we wait 
for the fuller analysis of that convention itself. As we have more than 
once said, and must 
<!--
214 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p214"></a> 
repeat again because of the undue air of triumph with which the 
consideration is pressed upon us, the difficulty of the infinite 
multitude is not on the part of the Divine knowledge of it; if it be a 
rational object of thought, God would know it all at once, 
collectively, without successive summing up of parts. Still the parts 
would be there and they are the obstacle; and we are quite unsatisfied 
in mind when we are told to ignore the parts and regard only the whole, 
as God would do. We are pertinacious in our assertions; the parts are 
there, they make up the whole, and if their very nature appears to 
throw grave doubt on the rationality of such a whole, to such doubts we 
will cling until, we will not say our opponents, but our instructors, 
make their instructions more intelligible to our powers of 
understanding. For we cannot accept a proposition without some sort of 
motive, intrinsic or extrinsic to the subject, and such as we can 
understand.<p>
Our position of non <i>probatur</i>, or <i>not proven</i>, against 
those who hold an infinity of possibles may be further illustrated by 
the failure of the attempt to translate eternity into clear terms of 
time. If any one likes to say that eternity equals an infinity of 
years, months, weeks, days, hours, or seconds, he has the power to 
utter these words, but what do they signify? and what is their warrant? 
and what is the excess of the infinity of years over the infinity of 
seconds, sixty of which go to each minute? We should prefer to confess 
that we do not know how to effect the translation of eternity into 
time. Similarly we do not know which is the way to 
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING. 215 
--><A NAME="p215"></a> 
express how God now looks comprehensively upon the thoughts of a 
creature who is going to elicit thoughts throughout an eternity, that 
is, who is going to posit a series which will never reach a final 
limit, though it had a definite starting-point. Efforts to express 
eternity in measures of time seem to lead us into fallacies comparable, 
in part, to those whereby Zeno disproved the possibility of motion. 
Motion continuous, successive, and without actually divided parts was 
treated more or less like a fixed line, of co-existent parts, along 
which it might be supposed to take place and have its resting-places. 
But the fact is we cannot divide continuous motion itself into fixed 
intervals of rest. Neither have we any right to speak of the 
<i>duration</i> of an indivisible instant, nor to regard a finite 
duration as made up of instants without duration, nor to make sundry 
other suppositions which occasionally are made in dealing with those 
very unique ideas, motion and duration, which are without first 
<i>part</i> or last <i>part</i>, without <i>co-existent parts</i>, nay, 
without any actual <i>part</i> at all. For motion of its own nature is 
best conceived under the figure of an evenly-travelling point, which 
leaves no record behind it, but simply goes ever uniformly forward. On 
this subject we shall have to speak afterwards; at present we are only 
calling attention to the fallacy of translating continuously successive 
motion into co-existence and rest, and we are paralleling it with the 
fallacy of translating the infinite into the finite.<p>
Balmez has tried to illustrate the difficulties of  an infinity of 
finite parts. He says, in regard to  
<!--
216 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p216"></a> 
the assumed divisibility of finite space into infinite parts:<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> 
"Absurdities if we suppose infinite divisibility, absurdities if we 
suppose the opposite; obscurities if we admit unextended points, 
obscurities if we deny them. Victorious in attack, reason is helpless 
in defence, and unable to maintain an opinion. Nevertheless, reason 
cannot be in conflict with itself: the proof of two contradictories 
would be the absolute negation of reason. Therefore, the contradiction 
is but apparent; but who shall untie for us the knot!"<p>
We maintain that the foundation of the possibilities in an Infinite God 
leads to no proved contradiction, but only to a question which is 
suggested, yet seems incapable of clear formulation by the human mind. 
And when we remember the mere artifice to which we must have recourse, 
in order that we may have an idea of the infinite, which, while it 
really attains its object, yet fails to comprehend its inmost nature, 
we cannot be surprised that about this notion we have intimations of 
questions to be put, but cannot clearly put them. If we may borrow a 
rather distant analogy, we may use the illustration of a man who knows 
sound only as it is heard, but who knows nothing about its mode of 
propagation in a vibratory medium. He would ask some most unscientific 
questions about the wonder that there should be a sound apiece for each 
listener, about the disappearance of the sound as soon as it has been 
heard, and about other matters equally vexatious to the educated man. 
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING 217 
--><A NAME="p217"></a> 
What seems a hopeless inquiry when sound is discussed with no approach 
to an understanding of its physical conditions, becomes an intelligible 
question only when an adequate hypothesis has been framed. So we may be 
hopelessly muddling our brains over the infinite, because our 
conception of its nature is so very indirect and inadequate. It does 
not, then, seem extravagant to conclude, that perplexities concerning 
the infinite and its relations to the finite, are no real 
contradictions, but only attempts to think out problems that are beyond 
our data. We are trying to stretch our terms till they reach to heights 
and depths for which they are much too short. So when we are asked the 
question with which we started this discussion, "What is the sum-total 
of all the possibles?" we venture to maintain that the questioner has 
no right to press that inquiry upon us, till he has satisfied us that 
he has a determinate meaning to his words. Of course we must abide by 
the law of excluded middle: and <i>if</i> the subject of the sentence 
has a real meaning, and <i>if</i> in the case under discussion
non-finite is the same as infinite, then to the assertion, "The entire 
number of possibles is either finite or infinite," we must yield our 
assent. But we claim at present to take refuge in the conditionality of 
the conditional particles, the two <i>ifs</i>: and we wait till these 
can be replaced by the purely categorical statement, "The entire number 
of possibles is either finite or infinite." We take refuge in Mill's 
difficulty against the law of excluded middle, with this difference: he 
supposes 
<!--
218 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p218"></a> 
his difficulty to be valid against the law itself, while we hold it to 
be valid only against an uncertain application of the law. His 
proposition is, that when a predicate is declared either to belong or 
not to belong, to a certain subject, the assertion is open to the 
exception, that possibly the term standing as subject is devoid of real 
significance. This may be the defect of the phrase, "All the 
possibilities."<p>
It is the more needful to insist on the precise position which we take 
up, for it borders so near on the Hegelian territory, that it may 
easily be mistaken for one of its belongings. Hegel,<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> for example, 
teaches us that "in the narrower sense dogmatism consists in the 
tenacity which draws a hard and fast line between certain terms 
supposed to be absolute, and others contrary to these. We may see this 
clearly in the strict 'either -- or,' for instance, the world is either 
finite or infinite; but one of these two it must be. The contrary of 
this rigidity is the characteristic of all speculative truth. There no 
such inadequate formulae are allowed, nor can they possibly exhaust it. 
These formulae speculative truth holds in union as a totality, whereas 
dogmatism invests them in their isolation with a title to truth and 
fixity." Our way of dealing with the limitations of our understanding 
is quite different from the Hegelian. Instead of postulating a power  
<!--
THE FINITE AND THE INFINITE IN BEING. 219 
--><A NAME="p219"></a> 
higher than understanding, we simply do our best to make allowances 
for its limitations, so that the partial truths we reach are considered 
by us, not only as true, but also as partial, or as true only under the 
recognition that they are partial. Where we recognize a distinct 
contradiction between propositions, no matter how narrow, we refuse to 
believe that this real contradiction can he overcome by a so-called 
reason. Hence we cannot accept what follows on the passage just cited: 
"The soul is  the one just as much as the other, and in that way 
neither finite only, nor infinite only: it is really  neither one nor 
the other." If finite and infinite are here referred to the same 
aspect, and if the subject of the proposition, "soul," <i>can</i> be 
taken, as "the sum-total of possibilities" <i>cannot</i> be taken, with 
a perfectly clear and valid meaning; then on  the principle of excluded 
middle, the soul certainly is either infinite or not infinite, 
"infinite" here meaning inferentially finite, for it cannot be 
indefinite.<p>
The only reason why we cannot apply the like dichotomy to "the sum of 
the possibles," is because we cannot make sure about the meaning of  
the phrase. Given that "the sum of the possibles" has a clear 
signification and validity, then as we have said before, and now repeat 
for the sake of  emphasis, we should have to meet the difficulty from 
the law of the excluded middle. Some, therefore, would allow the 
infinity: others would say that non-infinite is not obviously the same 
as finite, but may be the indefinite. We ourselves have not allowed the 
question to go as far as this stage: we 
<!--
220 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p220"></a> 
have stopped the inquiry at its very birth by a demand for a perfectly 
intelligible interpretation of the words, "the sum of the possibles." 
On the ground above marked out we find a battlefield large enough for 
the quarrels which probably philosophers will not settle till the end 
of time, after which something higher than philosophy will enlighten 
those who, during life, have been consistently something higher than 
philosophers. Meantime we wait in humble acknowledgment of our 
limitations.<p>

and consequently can know, only the <i>conditionally limited</i>. The 
<i>unconditionally unlimited</i> or the Infinite, and the 
<i>unconditionally limited</i>, or the Absolute, cannot positively be 
construed to the mind: they can be conceived only by thinking away 
from, or abstraction of, those very conditions under which thought 
itself is realized: consequently the notion of the unconditioned is 
only negative -- the negative of the conceivable itself. For example, 
we can positively conceive, neither an absolute whole, that is, a whole 
so great that we cannot also conceive it as a relative part of a still 
greater whole; nor an absolute part, that is, a part so small that we 
cannot conceive it as a relative whole divisible into smaller parts." 
In further making the Absolute to be the contradictory of the Infinite, 
Hamilton only adds to the evidence that he is misconceiving the two: 
"<i>Absolutum</i> means <i>finished, perfected, completed</i>: it thus 
corresponds to the <b>to holon</b> and <b>to teleion</b> of Aristotle. 
In this acceptation -- and it is that in which I myself exclusively use 
it -- the Absolute is diametrically opposed to, is contradictory of, 
the Infinite." Our doctrine is, that if we take the Absolute to be that 
which is complete in its own nature, then the Absolute may be either 
infinite, as in the case of the Divine nature, or finite, as in the 
case of any created nature.<p>
