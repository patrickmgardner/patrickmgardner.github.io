(A) THE second part of this work has an aim like that of the first, so 
far as it takes up some of those perpetually recurrent notions upon 
which certain writers have managed to throw very dark 
<!--
222 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p222"></a> 
shadows. Bringing these forward to the open daylight, it tries to show 
plain men that they can understand them and be sure of their real 
validity. The opponents whom we shall seek to encounter will be mainly 
our English Empiricists, because they represent the most natural 
aberrations of British intellect; whereas other aberrations are of an 
imported character, being borrowed especially from Hegel. Lest, 
however, we be accused of hiding away that luminary from the sight of 
our readers, we will give a summary statement of his doctrine about the 
ideas with which we are going mainly to deal; and should this summary 
seem inviting to readers, they will be set on the task of investigating 
for themselves, with what results we will leave them to find out for 
themselves. Mr. Wallace shall furnish the synopsis:<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> "If the first 
branch of Logic was the sphere of simple Being in a point or series of 
points, the second is that of difference and discordant Being, broken 
up in itself. The progress in this second sphere -- of <i>Essentiae</i> 
or Relative Being -- consists in gradually overcoming the antithesis 
and discrepancy between the two sides of it -- the <i>Permanent</i> and 
the <i>Phenomenal</i>." Here precisely are the notions with which we, 
in our own way, are going to deal, while Hegel follows his way thus: 
"At first the stress rests upon the <i>Permanent</i> and true Being, 
which lies behind the seeming, upon the <i>Essence</i> or Substratum in 
the background, which lies behind the seeming, on which the show of 
immediate Being 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 223 
--><A NAME="p223"></a> 
has been proved, by the process in the first sphere, really to rest. 
Then, secondly, <i>Existence</i> comes to the front and 
<i>Appearances</i> or <i>Phenomena</i> are regarded as the only 
realities with which science can deal. And yet even in this case we 
cannot but distinguish between the <i>phenomena</i> and their 
<i>laws</i>, between <i>force</i> and its <i>exercise</i>; and thus 
repeat the relativity, though both terms of it are now transferred into 
the range of the <i>Phenomenal</i> world. The third range of essential 
Being is known as <i>Actuality</i>, where the two elements in relation 
rise to the level of independent existences, essences in phenomenal 
guise, bound together, and deriving their very characteristics from 
that close union. Relativity is now apparent in actual form, and 
comprises the three heads of <i>Substantial Relation, Causal 
Relation</i>, and <i>Reciprocal Relation</i>." <i>Substance, Canse, 
Relation</i>, and others are the notions we now want to investigate; 
but we shall not use the Hegelian method, though the fact of its 
existence we cannot now be accused of having failed duly to advertise. 
We can claim no more than to have advertised it, for to make its 
meaning plain is more than we profess to be able to accomplish. At 
least the reader will recognize the notions which Hegel wants to 
interpret to him to be those which we also discuss in the following 
chapters; and furthermore, he will have a specimen page, to show him 
what very tough material Hegel offers for the philosopher's 
mastication. In detail we shall seldom recur to Hegel; for our best way 
of refuting him is to make the clearest and most convincing exposition 
we can of 
<!--
224 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p224"></a> 
our own positive doctrine; to which work without further preface we 
proceed.<p>
The course we have yet to travel over is not quite settled either by 
the nature of things or by common agreement; but under the guidance of 
"sweet reasonableness," after having brought Ontology in its stricter 
sense, as the doctrine of Being, to its close, we must survey those 
other grounds which General Metaphysics may fairly claim to occupy. 
Next to Being the scholastics generally place in the treatise a 
selection from the highest genera, such as they are declared to be by 
the Aristotelian categories; for these come nearest in their generality 
to the "transcendental" term which is confined within no one genus 
however high. The categories are Substance, Quantity, Quality, 
Relation, Where? When? Posture, Action, Passion, Habit. Of these 
Substance and Action will claim the lion's share of our attention; 
Cosmology deals with nearly all the others as well as with the two just 
mentioned; but we shall merely add to the latter a few notions as to 
Time and Space. At once it will be perceived that the second part is 
divided from the first by no very hard and fast line; for in the 
former, after we had considered Being in its rigorously transcendental 
characters, we went on further to consider it in its determinations as 
actual and possible, necessary and contingent, infinite and finite. The 
chief difference now is, that we are going to borrow the determinations 
from some of the Aristotelian categories, and consider Being as 
substantial and accidental, as active in opposition 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 225 
--><A NAME="p225"></a> 
to passive, as relative in opposition to absolute, as spacial and as 
temporal. So that if any one wants a more accurate partition of our 
work, he may have it under three headings -- Being as quite 
undetermined or transcendental, Being as determined by highly general 
characters not contained in the Aristotelian categories, and Being as 
determined by highly general characters contained within those 
categories.<p>
If we may make here one remark as to a matter of precise terminology, 
the schoolmen do not usually rank God under the categories; yet they 
apply analogously to Him the terms Substance, Relation, Action. With 
this understanding we shall make some provision for the application of 
Substance and Action to God.<p>
(B) (1) The whole of Being is divisible into Substance and Accident; but 
how these differ it will take us some time to settle, for we shall have 
much to do in the way of refutation before we come to our own positive 
doctrine. To begin with, we may make short work of certain definitions 
which tend to limit, or do actually limit, substance to a single 
instance, and so favour pantheism. Thus Descartes lays it down<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> that 
"substance is a thing which exists of itself, in such sort that it 
needs for its existence no other thing; and, indeed, the substance 
needing absolutely nothing else can be but one, namely, God." Though 
the author does not himself teach that God is the only substance, but  
<!--
226 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p226"></a> 
rather that God is the only perfect substance, yet he leads the way to 
the pure pantheism of Spinoza,<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> who writes, "By substance I 
understand that which is in itself and is conceived by itself; in other 
words, that the concept of which does not need the concept of anything 
else to aid its formation." That there may be no mistake about his 
meaning, he plainly declares that no substance can produce another, and 
that only one substance can exist, of which all other things are either 
attributes or modes. We should allow to these definitions the element 
of truth that the completely independent substance is only one; that 
God is a substance with a perfection wherewith no created thing is a 
substance; still as we cannot tolerate that finite objects should be 
regarded as real parts of God, either His attributes or His modes, we 
dislike the definition of Descartes, while that of Spinoza we wholly 
repudiate.<p>
(2) The next error about substance will cost us much more labour in its 
discussion, for we shall have to enter somewhat minutely into the 
history of opinions. Some may shrink from such minutiae, but perhaps 
they will have the courage to overcome their repugnance if they are 
reminded of the importance of the issue. There is a traditional English 
philosophy which has much vogue in our country to-day; its boast is 
that it has brought the scholastic notion of substance into utter 
contempt -- in fact has put it out of all reasonable consideration.
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIbENT. 227 
--><A NAME="p227"></a><p>
This verdict is widely accepted by numbers who have no notion of the 
real meaning of the controversy. Hence it is worth while to trace at 
some length the course of this revolution in thought; and no apology 
for repeated quotations will be wanted by those who understand that if 
they are to judge a weighty and intricate case, they must have the 
patience to hear the witnesses. After the evidence shall come a clear 
verdict; but it is unwise to precipitate the decision. Moreover, the 
accused shall speak for themselves, and not through reporters, who 
often report inaccurately. Locke leads the way in the departure from 
sound doctrine, but as in the case of essence,<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> so too in the present 
case, he builds up again with one hand what he had pulled down with the 
other: he is only a half-hearted destroyer. There are indeed sentences 
in the 23rd chapter of his second book which seem to prove him a 
thorough-going iconoclast; for instance this: "Not imagining how simple 
ideas can subsist by themselves, we accustom ourselves to suppose some 
<i>substratum</i> wherein they do subsist, and from which they do 
result; which therefore we call substance. So that if any one will 
examine himself, <i>concerning his pure notion of substance in 
general</i>,<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> he will find that he has no other idea of it at all, 
but only a supposition of he knows not what support of such qualities 
as are capable of producing simple ideas in us, which qualities are 
commonly  
<!--
228 TRANSCENDENTAL BRING. 
--><A NAME="p228"></a> 
called accidents. The idea of substance being nothing but the 
supposed, but unknown support of those qualities we find existing, 
which we imagine cannot subsist <i>sine re substante</i>, without 
something to support them, we call that support <i>substantia</i>." 
There are two radical errors here: first, the usual blunder of Locke, 
that because all actual things are singular, general names do not stand 
for realities, but are "fictions of the mind;" and, second, the error 
of fancying that the primary notion of substance is some hidden-away 
support, really distinct from the accidents which it holds together. As 
we shall see later, the radical notion of substance is preserved, even 
though it should prove true that it is substance itself which 
immediately acts on our senses, manifesting its own qualities as modes 
of its own activity. Locke himself, whose errors are often rather those 
of confusion than of complete misrepresentation, gives, in his reply to 
Stillingfleet, the most ample assurances that in spite of appearances 
he still believes in the reality of substance.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> "It is laid to my 
charge that I took the being of substance to be doubtful, or rendered 
it so by the imperfect or ill-grounded idea I have of it. To which I 
beg leave to say that I ground not the <i>being</i>, but the 
<i>idea</i> of substance on our accustoming ourselves to suppose some 
<i>substratum</i>: for it is of the idea alone that I speak there, and 
not of the  
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 229 
--><A NAME="p229"></a> being of substance. And having everywhere affirmed and built upon 
it, that a man is a substance, I cannot be supposed to question or 
doubt of the being of substance. Further, I say, 'Sensation convinces 
us that there are solid, extended substances, and reflexion that there 
are thinking ones.' So that I think the being of substance is not 
shaken by what I have said; and if the idea<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> of it should be yet (the 
being of things not depending on our ideas) the being of substance 
would not be shaken by my saying we had but an obscure, imperfect idea 
of it, and that that idea came from our accustoming ourselves to 
suppose some <i>substratum</i>; or, indeed, if I should say that we had 
no idea of substance at all. For a great many things may be, and are 
granted to have a being, of which we have no ideas. The being then of 
substance being safe, let us see whether the idea of it be not so too. 
I have said that it is grounded upon this, 'That we cannot conceive how 
simple ideas of sensible qualities subsist alone, and therefore we 
suppose them to exist in, and be supported by, some common subject, 
which subject we denote by the uame substance.' Which I think is a true 
reason, because it is the same your lordship grounds the supposition of 
a <i>substratum</i> on in this very page; even on the repugnancy to our 
conceptions that modes and accidents should subsist by themselves."  
<!--
230 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p230"></a> 
Thus Locke takes up the not very clear position, that whether or not 
he has any real idea of it, there is such a thing as substance; and, 
moreover, that he has a real idea of it, because of his "custom to 
suppose a <i>substratum</i>, not imagining how simple ideas can subsist 
by themselves:" indeed on no account will he be thought "almost to 
discard substance out of the reasonable part of the world." What he 
really wants to teach us is, that we understand no more of the admitted 
reality, substance, than that it is a something -- we know not what -- 
which is always needful to account for the groups of phenomena brought 
under our experience; that beyond this generic conception of substance 
we cannot advance; that being known as a <i>substratum</i>, but 
otherwise unknown, it may be called "the unknown substratum," which is 
"fiction of the mind" simply because it is "a general idea."<p>
A last quotation we will give as strongly illustrative of Locke's 
position, not only as to substance, but as to essence also -- two 
subjects which authors generally treat in a kindred spirit.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> "Had we 
such ideas of substances as to know what real constitutions produce 
those sensiblc qualities we find in them, and how those qualities flow 
from thence, we could, by the specific ideas of the real essences in 
our minds, more certainly find out their properties, and discover what 
qualities they had or had not, than we can now by our senses; and to 
know the properties of gold it would be no more necessary that gold 
should exist and that 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 231 
--><A NAME="p231"></a> 
we should make experiments upon it, than it is necessary for the 
knowing the properties of a triangle, that a triangle should exist in 
any matter. But we are so far from being admitted into the secrets of 
nature, that we can scarce so much as even approach the first entrance 
towards them. For we are wont to consider the substances we meet with, 
each of them as an entire thing by itself, having all its qualities in 
itself, and independent of other things; overlooking for the most part 
the operations of those invisible fluids they are accompanied with, and 
upon whose motions and operations depend the greatest part of these 
qualities which are taken notice of in them, and are made by us the 
inherent marks of distinction whereby we know and determine them. Put a 
piece of gold anywhere by itself, separate from the influence and reach 
of all other bodies, it will immediately lose all its colour and 
weight, and perhaps malleableness too; which, for aught I know, would 
be changed into a perfect friability. Water, in which to us fluidity is 
the essential quality, left to itself would cease to be fluid. But if 
inanimate bodies owe so much of their present state to other bodies 
without them, that they would not be what they appear to us, were these 
bodies that environ them removed, it is yet more so in vegetables . . . 
and animals . . . . We are then quite out of the way when we think that 
things contain within themselves the qualities that appear to us in 
them; and we in vain search for that constitution within the body of a 
fly or an 
<!--
232 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p232"></a> 
elephant, upon which depend those qualities and powers we observe in 
them."<p>
Enough now has been done to give a view of Locke's position; and our 
next labour must be to find out how Hume took up some of Locke's 
sceptical hints, and carried them further than his predecessor ever 
dreamt of going with them. Hume reduces man<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> to a series of 
"perceptions," which are divisible into "impressions" and "ideas," the 
impressions being further subdivisible into "sensations" and "emotions" 
or "passions." The emotions are termed "reflexions."<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> The test of an 
"impression" is its liveliness as compared with an "idea," which is its 
"faint copy," and the test of the reality of an "idea" is the 
possibility of tracing it back to some "impression" as its source. All 
that can be said of this source itself is, that "sensations arise 
originally in the soul from some unknown causes:" they are in our 
regard ultimates. Moreover, impressions and ideas cannot be said to 
have any substance to hold them together: we are in a position to 
assert only the bond of phenomenal association.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> "Were ideas 
entirely loose and unconnected, chance alone would join them; and 'tis 
impossible the same simple ideas should fall regularly into complex 
ones (as they commonly do)  
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 233 
--><A NAME="p233"></a> 
<i>without some bond of union among them, some associating quality by 
which one idea naturally introduces another</i>. This uniting principle 
among ideas is not to be considered as an inseparable connexion; for 
that has been already excluded from the imagination; nor yet are we to 
conclude that without it the mind cannot join two ideas; for nothing is 
more free than that faculty; but we are only to regard it as a gentle 
force which commonly prevails. The qualities from which this 
association arises, and by which the mind is conveyed from one idea to 
another, are three, namely, Resemblance, Contiguity in time and place, 
and Cause and Effect." Thus the perceptions themselves are made all in 
all: they are the acts of no substantial soul; they come and go by 
their own mutual affinities. Not to real outer substances, but to 
association of impressions and ideas, is attributed what we know of the 
arrangements called the order of physical nature: inasmuch as "the 
senses, in changing their object, are necessitated to change them 
regularly, and take them as they lie contiguous to each other." Yet 
Hume does not wholly fail to distinguish "a natural world" from "a 
mental world": for he says, whatever may be the consistent meaning of 
his words,<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> that "there is a kind of attraction which in the mental 
world will be found to have as extraordinary effects as in the natural, 
and to show itself in as many and in as various forms." One would think 
that he had pretty nearly identified the two worlds for all purposes of 
human know<!--
234 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p234"></a>ledge. Yet, as though he had been a common realist, he is at pains 
to assure us of the correspondence between the two, as between two 
different orders.<p>
We are brought next explicitly to Hume's doctrine on the notion of 
substance. He tells<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> us to renounce the quest of causes, and to be 
content with analyzing effects, dividing our "complex ideas" into 
"Relations, Modes, and Substances." An examination of the last will 
show us "that we have no idea of substance distinct from the collection 
of particular qualities. The idea of Substance as well as that of Mode 
is nothing but a collection of simple ideas that are united by the 
imagination, and have a particular name assigned to them, by which we 
are able to recall, either to ourselves or others, that collection." 
Commonly indeed, but by a "fiction," "the particular qualities are 
referred to an unknown <i>something</i> in which they are supposed to 
inhere."<p>
Thus, whereas Locke had maintained that we could not in reason deny 
substance, though we knew no more about it than that it was a something 
in which attributes inhered as in their subject, Hume goes beyond his 
predecessor and declares that reason demands no such bond. He is 
content with "perceptions," and their laws of association. He is so 
little concerned with Locke's great question about perceptions, namely, 
the question of innate ideas, that he dismisses the whole business with 
a short reference to his own psychology; it is a mere matter of the 
difference between vivid and 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 235 
--><A NAME="p235"></a> 
faint states of consciousness.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> "Understanding by innate what is 
original or copied from no precedent perception, we may assert that all 
our impressions are innate, and all our ideas not innate." Even 
admirers of Hume, can hardly withhold their confession that this 
treatment is too off-hand for so serious a controversy. It is shallow, 
as is much else in the same author. His thoroughly perverted notion of 
substance is only part of a perverse system. The reason why Hume cares 
very little for the word "innate" is obvious: for besides his denial of 
efficient causality, he leaves no mind wherein ideas may be innate: he 
has only ideas themselves, and of course it is useless to inquire 
whether these are innate in themselves. On this point Mr. Huxley, who 
seems to take his author so much more seriously than that author took 
himself, gives us most apposite quotations:<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> "What we call the mind 
is nothing but a heap or collection of different perceptions united 
together by certain relations." "The true idea of the human mind is to 
consider it as a system of different perceptions, or different 
existences which are linked together by the relation of cause and 
effect,<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> which mutually produce, destroy, influence, and modify each 
other. In this respect I cannot compare the soul more properly to 
anything than to a republic or common<!--
236 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p236"></a>wealth, in which the several members are united by the reciprocal 
ties of government and subordination, and give rise to other persons 
who propagate the same republic in the incessant changes of its parts." 
The members of a state are separate substances, living on a substantial 
part of the globe, and so they can manage to keep up their connexion: 
but how Hume's unsubstantial perceptions are to hold together in 
orderly existence without a substantial mind, baffles all conception. 
The supposition that they do so cohere, offers, as a basis for 
psychology, a hypothesis on which no solid system can possibly be 
built.<p>
Hume's very words, and many of them, have purposely been given because 
of the conviction that, if seriously weighed, they will utterly 
discredit their author. It is a fact that numbers of people go on 
swallowing, as a child will swallow poison which is sweetened over with 
sugar, the reiterated assertion that Hume thoroughly unmasked the 
fiction of substance, and proved it to be the idlest of scholastic 
dreams, for which he substituted a thoroughly scientific conception. 
Whereas the fact is, that his theory stands a very portent of 
unscientific construction for any one who will examine the case by 
pulling to pieces the ill-compacted monstrosity. Hume did not believe 
in his own extravagances. Though he speaks of sensations "as innate," 
and "rising originally in the soul from unknown causes," yet when 
forced to retreat from this position, he takes shelter under the 
ordinary derivation of them, and declares that "an impression first 
strikes on the senses; of it 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 237 
--><A NAME="p237"></a> 
there is a copy taken by the mind." What gives the impression is 
"body," and in the reality of "body" we have got to acquiesce, whatever 
speculatively may be our doubts. For<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> "a man must assent to the 
principle concerning the existence of <i>body</i>, though he cannot 
pretend by any arguments of philosophy to maintain its veracity. Nature 
has not left this to his choice, and has doubtless esteemed it an 
affair of too great importance to be trusted to our uncertain 
reasonings and speculations. We may well ask what causes induce us to 
believe in the existence of <i>body</i>: but 'tis vain to ask whether 
there be <i>body</i> or not; that is a point which we must take for 
granted in all our reasonings." This <i>Body</i>, if analyzed, will 
turn out to be material Substance, and with regard to it Hume's 
instruction to us is: If you believe what I have been pleased to call 
my philosophy, you won't believe in body: but the fact is you can't 
help believing in body, and making it the very basis of your reasoning 
on corporeal things. Therefore, in practice, yield to the superior 
force of nature over my philosophy: but all the same respect my 
philosophy from grounds of high speculation where practical 
impossibilities may be disregarded.<p>
We have now got a fairly adequate sketch of Hume's vagaries on the 
question of substance; with the exception that we have not yet quoted 
his admission that even on the principles of speculative philosophy 
there are substances, if calling substance no longer a 
<i>substratum</i>, we define it as<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> 
<!--
238 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p238"></a> 
"something that can exist by itself." Because, when the time comes, we 
shall make this our own primary idea of substance -- <i>id quod per se 
stat</i> -- the declaration of Hume is important, and to some extent we 
shall agree with our adversary; though we shall have to disagree with 
his application of the definition which leads to the result that "every 
perception is a substance, and every distinct part of a perception is a 
distinct substance."<p>
To the point raised here we shall recur later; at present we will only 
recapitulate the whole of Hume's most objectionable doctrine in a very 
few words from Ueberweg:<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> "We have no clear ideas of anything but 
impressions: a substance is something quite different from an 
impression: hence we have no knowledge of substance. Inherence 
(inhesion) in something is regarded as necessary for the existence of 
our perceptions; but in reality they need no substrate. The questions 
whether perceptions inhere in a material or in an immaterial substance 
cannot be answered; neither has it any intelligible meaning." It is the 
acceptance of this doctrine by so many of the philosophers in England 
that is a disgrace to the sound sense of the nation. The theory would 
not be received if its real nature were better understood; and 
therefore so many pages have been expended in its statement.<p>
Having traced an error from Locke to Hume, we will add a few words 
about its recent champions. As on of the chief propagators of Hume's 
bad philosophy in our own generation stands Mill. Not quite 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT 239
--><A NAME="p239"></a> 
unwaveringly, but characteristically, he is an idealist with regard to 
matter, and assigns to it no known reality outside the senses.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> 
"Matter may be defined as a permanent possibility of sensation. If I am 
asked whether I believe in matter, I ask whether the questioner accepts 
this definition of it. If he does, I believe in matter, and so do all 
Berkeleians; in any other sense I do not." So much for his profession 
of belief as to matter; mind he reduces similarly to actual and 
possible states of consciousness, with the important addition, that 
between these there must be some real, though undescribable bond, a 
bond not required for the connexion of material objects.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> "The 
theory which resolves mind into a series of feelings, with a background 
of possibilities of feeling, can effectually withstand the most 
invidious of the arguments directed against it. The remembrance of a 
sensation, even if it be not referred to any particular state, involves 
the suggestion and belief that a sensation, of which it is a copy, 
actually existed in the past; and an expectation involves the belief, 
more or less positive, that a sensation, or other feeling to which it 
directly refers, will exist in the future. Nor can the phenomena 
involved in these two states of consciousness be adequately expressed, 
without saying that the belief they include is, that I myself formerly 
had, or that I myself shall hereafter have, the sensations remembered 
or expected. If, therefore, we speak of the mind as a series of 
feelings, we are obliged to complete the statement by calling it a 
series of 
<!--
240 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p240"></a> 
feelings aware of itself as past and present, and we are reduced to 
the alternative of believing that the mind, or <i>Ego</i>, is something 
different from the series of feelings, or possibilities of them, or of 
accepting the paradox that something, which <i>ex hypothesi</i>, is but 
a series of feelings, can be aware of itself as a series." So
deep-seated is Mill's horror of substance that he prefers to take up 
the paradox, which he calls, "an ultimate inexplicability," such as in 
last analyses, he says, we must come across because we can explain no 
further. The same is Mr. Spencer's plea for calling all ultimate 
scientific ideas "inconceivable," or "unknowable": to "know" is "to 
comprehend," that is, to rank under some more ultimate idea; but 
ultimate notions themselves cannot be ranked under more ultimate; they 
must be accepted with a vague consciousness, but they cannot be known. 
Mill, therefore, summons up his resolution to make an act of faith 
"that something which has ceased, or is not yet in existence, can still 
be in a manner present; that a series of feelings, the infinitely 
greater part of which is past or future, can be gathered up, <i>as it 
were</i>, into a single present conception accompanied by a belief of 
reality." Truly this is "a paradox" on Mill's principles, and may well 
require the qualifications "in a manner," and "as it were," or some 
other saving clause to help it out.<p>
In a later edition<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> Mill was driven to make more explicit 
acknowledgment of the real bond that is requisite to unite together the 
several states 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT 241 
--><A NAME="p241"></a> 
of consciousness. "The inexplicable tie or law, the organic union 
which connects the present consciousness with the past one, of which it 
reminds me, is as near, I think, as we can get to a positive conception 
of self. That there is something real in this tie, real as the 
sensations themselves, and not a mere product of the laws of thought, 
without any fact corresponding to it, I hold to be indubitable. Whether 
we are directly conscious of it in the act of remembrance, as we are of 
succession in the fact of having successive sensations, or whether, 
according to the opinion of Kant, we are not conscious of self at all, 
but are compelled to assume it as a necessary condition of memory, I do 
not undertake to decide. But this original element which has no 
community of nature with any of the things answering to our names, and 
to which we cannot give any name but its own peculiar one without 
implying some false or ungrounded theory, is the <i>Ego</i>, or 
<i>self</i>. As such I ascribe a reality to the <i>Ego</i> -- to my own 
mind -- different from that real existence as a permanent possibility, 
which is the only reality I acknowledge in matter."<p>
It would not be easy to declare exactly what was the view either of 
Hume or of Mill; for they both labour under a certain degree of 
inevitable obscurity; but at any rate the tendency of their teaching 
has been sufficiently indicated, and we shall possess a fairly clear 
idea what it is that we have to refer when we seek to establish 
controversially our knowledge of substance. Mill might suffice as the 
exponent of Humism in the nineteenth 
<!--
242 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING 
--><A NAME="p242"></a> 
century; but his great ally, Mr. Bain, may usefully be quoted, because 
some of his utterances will discover to us still more fully the enemy's 
position, before we make our onset.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> "Substance is not the 
antithesis of all the attributes, but the antithesis of the 
fundamental, essential, or defining attributes, and such as are 
variable or inconstant.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> From the relative character of the word 
attribute, the fancy grew up that there must be a <i>substratum</i>, or 
something different from attributes, for all attributes to inhere in. 
Now as anything that can impress the human mind -- Extension, 
Resistance, &c. -- may be and is termed an attribute, we seem driven 
entirely out of reality if we find a something that could not be called 
an attribute, and might stand as a substance. Substance is not the 
absence of all attributes, but the most fundamental, persisting, 
inerasable or essential attribute or attributes in each case. The 
substance of gold is its high density, colour, lustre -- everything 
that we consider necessary to its being gold. Withdraw these, and gold 
itself would no longer exist; substance and everything else would 
disappear." Mr. Bain is not wholly wrong in some of these assertions; 
for it is true that, in the wide sense of attribute, we can put almost 
anything into the shape of an attribute,<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> saying even that it is the 
attribute of a certain 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT 243 
--><A NAME="p243"></a> 
object to be a substance; for we can predicate of it that it is a 
substance. But while we can go with him a certain way, he makes it 
clear to us that we cannot go with him the whole length of his 
doctrine. For after telling us that the substance of matter is inertia 
or resistance, he declares that the substance of mind is feeling, will, 
and thought; and that "the supposition of an <i>Ego</i>, or self, for 
the powers to inhere in, is a pure fiction, coined from non-entity by 
the illusion of supposing, that because attribute applies to something, 
there must be something which cannot be described as an attribute." 
Finally, in <i>Mind</i> Mr. Bain has declared that to him "the word 
substance has no meaning." He cannot therefore allow that behind 
phenomena "there is anything to scrutinize;" and, he is confident that 
"certainly in respect to matter we seem to know all that is to be 
known, as far as regards ultimate properties," and that "if there be 
anything beneath all this which a grudging power hides from us, we need 
say nothing about it: to us the curtain is the picture." So we are to 
give up hankering after a revelation of "an unknown and unknowable 
<i>substratum</i>," because this is "an idea we cannot possibly obtain 
by experience.<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup><p>
Our English philosophers in their denial of substance have a following 
in France, where M. Taine<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> declares his opinion that "there is 
neither spirit nor matter, but only groups of movements actual and 
possible, and groups of thoughts actual and possible; 
<!--
244 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p244"></a> 
there are no substances, but only systems of facts, . . . substance 
and force being relics of scholastic entities: there exist only facts 
and their laws, events and their relations." The only legitimate sense 
which he allows to substance is that "substance is the whole of which 
the qualities are the constituent parts," or "the different points of 
view," taken singly and by abstraction from the rest. The empirical 
school, in their denial of substance, were opposed by Hamilton and his 
school; but he rests his cause on his very awkward law of the 
Conditioned, which is so often dragged in to decide a controversy. By 
this law we are supposed to be forced to pass beyond the phenomenal to 
the noumenal.<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> "Take substance. I am aware of a phenomenon -- a 
phenomenon be it of mind or of matter; that is, I am aware of a certain 
relative, consequently conditioned, existence. This existence is only 
known, and only knowable, as in relation. Mind and matter exist for us 
only as they are known for us: and they are known only as they have 
certain qualities relative to certain faculties of knowledge in us, and 
we certain faculties of knowledge relative to certain qualities in 
them. All our knowledge of mind and matter is thus relative, that is, 
conditioned." But we cannot think mind or matter as only thus 
conditioned, but "are compelled by a necessity of nature to think that 
out of this relativity it has an absolute or irrelative existence -- an 
existence as absolute or irrelative, unknown and incomprehensible; that 
it is the known phe<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 245 
--><A NAME="p245"></a>nomenon of an unknown substance." It is very troublesome to have to 
believe an object which we declare unknown: and therefore we will try 
to give an account of substance which shall make it the known object of 
our conceptions as well as of our belief. We will endeavour to show 
that it is a notion quite intelligible in itself, to which reality 
answers on the side of the object, and which is derived from the most 
ordinary use of our understanding.<p>
(3) The work now before us, which is not a slight one, is gradually to 
disengage the essential idea of substance, and to show that this idea 
represents something real.<p>
(a) Roughly it is said that substance is what exists by itself and does 
not inhere in another: but this declaration is open to misconstruction 
until it is more precisely limited. For a spoon inserted into some 
preserves is a substance, though it inheres in something else. Upon 
this earth of ours, where nothing seems to stand by itself, but 
everything is supported by some other objects, we need a more accurate 
determination of substance than simply to say, it is that which exists 
of itself without being sustained by another. Not only may substance 
rest on substance, but the schoolmen speak of substantial forms, which 
are obviously not accidents, yet which inhere in matter, as, for 
instance, man's soul in his body; and they speak also of substantial 
forms still more dependent on matter, so that they could not exist 
alone, as does man's soul after death. To put before ourselves a clear 
notion of the 
<!--
246 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p246"></a> 
mode of inherence which distinguishes an accident, we had better 
select a class of real accidents about which there can be no dispute. A 
man may dispute whether his faculties are really distinct from his 
soul: but that the acts of these faculties, his thoughts and volitions, 
are in some real sense distinct from his soul is a truth which St. 
Thomas says no sane person can dispute.<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> Ideas and wishes come and 
go: they so depart as to leave habits formed, and memories of 
themselves afterwards recallable: they are joined to a continuous 
consciousness in the unity of the <i>Ego</i>, or I; the successive 
states are real, and the mind to which they belong is real, and the 
contrast between the two gives, on reflexion, the two different notions 
of substance and accident. It is irrational, after the teaching of 
Hume, to regard each "perception" or mental phenomenon as a distinct 
substance, and it is equally irrational to regard it as an activity or 
state belonging to no substance. Wandering thoughts we may have in one 
meaning of the phrase, but it is nonsense to talk of thoughts existing 
apart from a thinking substance, or, as Mill puts it, "a series of 
states aware of itself as a series." This will appear more clearly when 
we declare what we mean by substance. The like contrast between 
substance and accidents is shown indisputably between an organism and 
its sensations, a projectile and its velocity, a carriage and its 
motion. No one can intelligibly maintain that sensation, velocity, and 
motion are realities of no sort, or that they are 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 247 
--><A NAME="p247"></a> 
realities not inherent in substance, or that they are realities quite 
identified with the reality of their substance as such. The examples 
chosen have all been of the more incontrovertible order: for whether 
there exist those more than mere modal accidents, as they are sometimes 
called, that is, quantity and qualities which most theologians suppose 
to be proved capable of a separate existence by the mystery of the 
sacramental species in the Holy Eucharist, -- this is a question which 
we way leave to Theology, for it is chiefly thence that the philosophic 
theory has been derived. But in the case of thoughts, volitions, and 
motions we have manifest instances of what we mean by real accidents: 
for these even by Divine power could not exist at all unless they had a 
subject of inhesion. On the other hand, no substance rests upon another 
as in a subject of inhesion: the substance exists <i>per se</i>, and 
the best way to fix in the mind the distinction between the two modes 
of existence is steadily to contemplate the case of mind with its 
thoughts and volitions, or of body with its movements at different 
velocities. "Substance is Being inasmuch as this Being is by itself; 
accident is that whose Being is to be in something else (<i>tanquam 
cujus esse est inesse</i>)." Such is the definition of St. Thomas 
formed in accordance with the method of discrimination above 
explained.<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup><p>
As repetition in these matters is useful, the account already given 
shall be given again in the 
<!--
248 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p248"></a> 
words of a scholastic writer who is not at all inclined to exceed in 
his scholasticism. "As soon as we begin," says Tongiorgi,<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> "to 
reflect upon our experience, whether inner or outer, we obtain the 
notion of substance and accident, even though the philosophic names be 
unknown to us. For in truth so many changes, and such constant 
succession in things, straightway show us that there must be something 
which is recipient of these -- which gains and loses them -- which is 
their subject. For example, the wax which I handle is now warm, now 
cold; first hard, then soft, and finally liquid; by the pressure of the 
fingers it acquires first one shape, and afterwards another: yet 
throughout it is the same piece of wax. There is, therefore, a subject 
permanent under the successive changes: it is one while they are many; 
it can be without any particular set of them, they cannot be without 
it, for they are precisely its modifications. Similarly as regards the 
experience of our inner consciousness: amid the multitude, variety, and 
succession of the ways in which we are consciously affected, we 
perceive something which is one, the same, and constant, namely, that 
which is the subject of the different states, and which experiences 
them as its own. Thus experience, outer as well as inner, furnishes us 
the idea of something which is <i>per se</i> and of something which is 
<i>in altero</i>; the former is substance, the latter accident. And 
between these two conditions of Being there is no medium: there is no 
Being which does not belong to the one or the 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 249 
--><A NAME="p249"></a> 
other category." Hence substance is said to be <i>id quod est</i>, 
while accident is said to be <i>id quo est</i>: substance is that which 
is: accident is that whereby substance is modified. Of the two orders 
of experience, internal and external, the former is the most telling: 
the merest rustic is convinced that he has some permanent self, which 
undergoes the real vicissitudes of joy and sadness, of love and hatred, 
of heat and cold, of hunger and satisfied appetite. The unity is 
necessary for the comparison, and the variety of conscious affections 
is necessary to furnish the materials of comparison.<p>
When, therefore, it is said that analysis or reflexion is necessary to 
draw out from experience the distinction between substance and 
accident, it need not be strictly a philosophic process: common sense 
is adequate to the task, though philosophy may do it more perfectly. 
Reid<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> introduces an unnecessary mystery into the grounds for the 
judgment that qualities imply a subject; whereas it is an obvious 
interpretation of facts, when we assert substances and accidents, and 
declare the latter to depend for their existence upon the former, or to 
be inherent in their respective subjects. We maintain the distinction 
to be given by a most rational analysis of experience, within the 
competence of any fairly educated man: whereas Reid attributes it to 
unaccountable "suggestion," or to "an inference" which we cannot 
logically defend. "If any man should demand proof that sensation cannot 
be with<!--
250 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p250"></a>out a mind or sentient Being, I confess that I can give none; and 
that to pretend to prove it seems to me almost as absurd as to deny 
it."<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup> Then he falls back as usual on the mysterious process of 
nature which no man can account for:<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup> "Leaving Hume's philosophy to 
those who have occasion for it, and can use it discreetly as a chamber 
exercise, we may still inquire how the rest of mankind, and even the 
adepts themselves, except in some solitary moments, have got so strong 
and irresistible a belief, that thought must have a subject, and be the 
act of some thinking Being: how every man believes himself to be 
something distinct from his ideas and impressions -- something which 
continues the same identical self when all his ideas and impressions 
are changed. It is impossible to trace the origin of this opinion in 
history, for all languages have it interwoven in their original 
construction. All nations have always believed it. The constitution of 
all laws and governments, as well as all common transactions of life, 
suppose it. It is no less impossible for any man to recollect when he 
himself came by this notion; for, as far back as we can remember, we 
were already in possession of it, and as fully persuaded of our own 
existence, and the existence of other things, as that one and one make 
two. It seems, therefore, that this opinion preceded all reason, and 
experience, and instruction: and this is the more probable because we 
could not get it by any of these means. . . By what rules of logic we 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 251 
--><A NAME="p251"></a> 
make the inference it is impossible to show; nay, it is impossible to 
show how our sensations and thoughts can give us the very notion either 
of a mind or of a faculty." Reid's mystery is merely the mystery, how 
there can be such a thing as reason at all; but if we take the fact on 
the abundantly sufficient evidence which comes before the consciously 
active reason that is within us, all will go well. We must reach an end 
of explanations somewhere, and if that before which we are brought to a 
standstill is self-evident truth, there is no room for decent 
complaint; it is not as though we stopped short at Mr. Spencer's 
"inconceivable ultimates." The analysis by the reflecting mind of its 
own experience into acts or phenomena which are transient, and into 
subjects of such acts or phenomena, giving to them their connexion, 
rests ultimately on intuitively evident data. Therefore it is a 
rational process with which we ought to rest content. We have already 
in part described the process: but more remains to be done before we 
have adequately established the idea of substance.<p>
(b) It is necessary to explain more fully what is meant by existing 
<i>per se</i>, and what by existing <i>in alio</i>. There is a sense in 
which God alone exists <i>per se</i>, that is, independently of all 
else; and there is a sense in which every created substance exists 
<i>in alio</i>, for in God "we live, move, and have our being." Not 
only did God create all finite things, but He is omnipresent to them, 
and ever conserves them in existence, or else they would be 
annihilated. "For how could anything endure if Thou wouldst not? or 
<!--
252 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p252"></a> 
be preserved if not called by Thee?"<sup><small><a name="n35"><a href="#n_35">{35}</a></a></small></sup> By agreement, then, the 
schoolmen have settled that they will not mean by <i>per se</i> the 
self-existence which is proper to God alone. To mark the distinction, 
St. Thomas even rejects, with an explanation, the definition of 
substance, which under another explanation might be accepted. "The 
definition of substance," he writes,<sup><small><a name="n36"><a href="#n_36">{36}</a></a></small></sup> "is not Being <i>per se</i> 
without a subject" (<i>ens per se sine subjecto</i>). At first sight 
the words appear to deny what we want to prove, namely, that to be 
<i>per se</i> is just what we ought to mean by substance. But the 
divergence simply turns on a double use of Being, either for 
<i>existence</i> or for the <i>thing</i> or <i>quiddity</i> which may 
exist: St. Thomas is speaking of the former, we are keeping our 
original engagement to abide by the latter. He says that absolutely to 
exist <i>per se</i> is peculiar to the Divine substance; but that 
<i>hypothetically</i>, if a created substance exist, it will exist 
<i>per se</i> (<i>quidditati seu essentiae substantiae competit habere 
esse non in subjecto</i>). On a like supposition St. Thomas, in another 
place,<sup><small><a name="n37"><a href="#n_37">{37}</a></a></small></sup> defines substance as "a thing <i>to the nature of which it 
is due</i> that it should not exist in a subject" (<i>res cujus naturae 
debetur non esse in alio</i>). The schoolmen, in order to leave <i>per 
se</i> applicable to both uncreated and created substance, have chosen 
<i>a se</i> to signify the special character of the former. When they 
affirm that some created things must exist <i>per se</i>, they do not 
deny that these things are from God, but they assert that the created 
world is not a mere 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 253 
--><A NAME="p253"></a> 
series of accidents, one inherent within another, and the whole either 
left without any subject or assignable to God as a subject. Such a 
series, whether it is regarded as finite or infinite, and such an 
inherence of all creatures in God as their substance, both involve 
impossibilities. Therefore our conclusion is that there are created 
substances, which in their own order are ultimate subjects, and do not 
inhere in other subjects: so far they exist <i>per se</i>. They are the 
<i>entia</i>, while their accidents stand in regard to them as <i>entia 
entium</i>. The doctrine is as old as Aristotle, who teaches that 
substance is "primarily and simply Being" (<b>to pr&ocirc;t&ocirc;s on, 
kai hapl&ocirc;s on</b>),<sup><small><a name="n38"><a href="#n_38">{38}</a></a></small></sup> while accidents are  "not simply Being" 
(<b>oud onta, h&ocirc;s hapl&ocirc;s eipein</b>).<sup><small><a name="n39"><a href="#n_39">{39}</a></a></small></sup> St. Thomas 
repeats the same doctrine. Even Hume, in a passage already quoted, says 
that he admits the reality of substances in the sense of things that 
exist by themselves: his error is to declare "perceptions" to be 
substances of this kind. Accordingly we are safe in our definition and 
in our understanding of it: substance is that which exists <i>per 
se</i>, or which has its own proper Being (<i>id cui ratione sui 
convenit esse, cui competit esse non in alio</i>); and thus it is 
opposed to accident, which exists <i>in alio</i>, or which at least 
naturally, whatever may happen preternaturally, has its Being only by 
inherence in a subject.<p> 
(c) It will give us the key to a host of difficulties if we hold firmly 
to this as the most radical definition of substance. According to it we 
see that 
<!--
254 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p254"></a> 
God is a substance, though He has no accidents, and does not present 
within Himself the double fact of a permanent essence, modified by 
perpetual changes of state. Etymologically indeed substance suggests 
<i>substare accidentibus</i>, "to underlie accidents:" but many a word, 
when applied to God, has to give up its etymological meaning, which 
even as applied to creatures often presents a superficial aspect rather 
than an essential nature. Now the chief attack on substance is made 
precisely on this misconception, that the inmost essence of the notion 
is a <i>substratum</i>, hidden away under qualities really distinct 
from itself, a fixed, unchangeable thing clothed in attributes, some 
variable, some constant, but all, as was just said, really distinct. 
Such is the interpretation of the scholastic theory by most opponents: 
while the schoolmen themselves have held up existence <i>per se</i> as 
the fundamental notion of substance. For, first, it is clear that they 
could apply no other definition to God, whom they never regarded as a 
compound Being, with attributes that were "accidental." Moreover, even 
with regard to created substance, they were aware of the enormous 
philosophic difficulty in the proof of what are sometimes called 
"absolute accidents that are more than merely modal," for the 
demonstration of which they relied not on mere arguments from reason, 
but upon consequences which they thought to be involved in the Church's 
doctrine about the Holy Eucharist. Notwithstanding which dogma, they 
had among their numbers those who taught that the substance of the soul 
was the 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 255 
--><A NAME="p255"></a> 
immediate agent in thought and volition, and did not act through the 
medium of really distinct faculties. In support of this historic 
assertion about the schoolmen, take the words of an author writing in 
the thirteenth century, Henry of Ghent:<sup><small><a name="n40"><a href="#n_40">{40}</a></a></small></sup> "The substance of the soul, 
which is really one thing, nevertheless according to its different 
determinations is said to have different faculties of intellect and 
sense: but radically its faculties are nothing but its simple 
substance, the diversity of powers adding nothing over and above its 
essence, except a reference to the diversity of its activities 
according as their objects vary." Duns Scotus was another who taught 
that the substance of the soul was the immediate agent in its 
activities, without the interposition of really distinct faculties; and 
he, being the head of a school, had many followers. These words are 
his:<sup><small><a name="n41"><a href="#n_41">{41}</a></a></small></sup> "The substance of the soul is really identical with its 
faculties; so that while in relation to body the soul is its 
substantial form, it takes the name of different faculties according to 
its different operations. Thus the soul is the eliciting principle and 
the recipient of its own acts, as appears in the act of intelligence: 
by its own substance it is at once the efficient cause and the subject, 
not by any faculty which is really distinct." What is here taught in 
regard to the soul was taught also in regard to material agencies: and 
Suarez, if not an  
<!--
256 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p256"></a> 
advocate of the opinion, is at least a witness as to its probability 
on mere philosophic grounds<sup><small><a name="n42"><a href="#n_42">{42}</a></a></small></sup> He says:<p>
"St. Thomas, with a sufficient amount of proof (<i>satis 
probabiliter</i>) establishes, that in every created nature the 
immediate principle of action is distinct from the substance, and is, 
therefore, an accident. To assign a reason for this <i>a priori</i> is 
difficult, though St. Thomas gives several probable arguments, which 
Scotus and others impugn, while Capreolus and Cajetan offer a vigorous 
and wideranging defence. But I think the efforts of these two latter 
writers unavailing, because in truth their reasons are not conclusive, 
nor ought a wise philosopher, in a question so recondite, to look for 
demonstration.<sup><small><a name="n43"><a href="#n_43">{43}</a></a></small></sup> For unless it can be shown to be above the degree of 
perfection possible to a created substance to be the immediate and 
single principle of an act which is in the order of accidents, we can 
assign no <i>a priori</i> reason why our present created agencies 
should always stand in need of an accidental principle whereby to act. 
That a creature should act proximately and solely by its own substance 
does not seem to require an infinite perfection in the order of 
substances; and only infinite perfection seems to be incommunicable to 
creatures."<sup><small><a name="n44"><a href="#n_44">{44}</a></a></small></sup>  
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 257  
--><A NAME="p257"></a> 
The purport of these quotations must not be misconceived: we have not 
got to settle the question of the real difference between substance and 
the most absolute of the "absolute" accidents, bu we have got to 
refute a common error. That error is that the scholastic notion of 
substance stands or falls with the truth of the supposed 
<i>substratum</i>, upon which are engrafted qualities or activities 
really distinct from it, and manifesting themselves to us as the only 
objects of our immediate experience. Against this theory we are showing 
that the essential notion of substance is, not that it is such a 
<i>substratum</i>, but that it is a Being existing <i>per se</i>: and 
that so far as substance is a <i>substratum</i>, the one class of 
accidents which are philosophically demonstrable beyond all controversy 
are modal accidents, such as thought, volition, and motion. Let us see 
what is meant in the words of a non-scholastic author: Mr. M'Cosh's 
opinion suffices for substance and for the substratum so far as the 
authors above quoted undertake fully to prove it apart from theological 
considerations: "I do not stand up," he says, "for an unknown 
<i>substratum</i>, beneath the known thing; whatever is known as 
existing, as acting, as having permanence, I regard as substance." So 
much reason can establish, putting it beyond a doubt that each distinct 
agent is a substance; but for the downright proof that there are 
accidents of quantity and quality which by Divine power might be made 
to go on existing and acting when their substance was no more, the 
schoolmen rested on their interpretation of the real species in 
<!--
258 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p258"></a> 
the Blessed Sacrament. This assertion, perhaps, will sound suspicious 
without witnesses, but witnesses we have in abundance. Among recent 
authors Dr. Dupont testifies that not philosophy, but theology, gave 
rise to the question of accidents which are more than merely modal.<sup><small><a name="n45"><a href="#n_45">{45}</a></a></small></sup> 
Father Mendive<sup><small><a name="n46"><a href="#n_46">{46}</a></a></small></sup> puts down the proposition not as indisputably true, 
but as more probable, and his chief arguments are from the Holy 
Eucharist and from the condition of grace as an accident in the soul; 
and Lepidi<sup><small><a name="n47"><a href="#n_47">{47}</a></a></small></sup> declares that we owe our knowledge on the matter, not 
simply to the light of reason, but to an inference from revealed 
doctrine. Nor are these declarations unsupported by what we actually 
find in the writings of the old schoolmen, as will appear if we return 
to the passage in Suarez, which we were lately considering. Having said 
that the arguments of St. Thomas to prove <i>a priori</i> the real 
distinction of the active powers of a created object from its substance 
are not demonstrative, he adds that the <i>a posteriori</i> or 
inductive arguments are better and lead <i>probabiliter satis</i> to a 
conclusion; but that the convincing proof is borrowed from the mystery 
of the Holy Eucharist. We are, then, amply warranted in our assertion 
that among the schoolmen, the essential idea of substance is 
independent of the controversy about a really distinct 
<i>substratum</i>; and that, therefore, the brunt of the enemy's attack 
on the notion is directed against a mere outwork, the capture of which 
would leave 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 259 
--><A NAME="p259"></a> 
the citadel safe as ever. He who is vaunted as the great victor over 
the old idea substance, Hume, is its champion in so far as he says that 
he believes in the existence of substance as in that which exists by 
itself.<p>
Whether what exists by itself will be permanent or not is a distinct 
question: it is possible for a created substance to be annihilated, 
though we are not aware of a complete instance in point: but at any 
rate, <i>permanence</i> is not of the essence of substance, any more 
than the non-permanence or succession of accidents is of their essence: 
Kant, therefore, and Green, are wrong in the leading position which 
they assign to permanence.<sup><small><a name="n48"><a href="#n_48">{48}</a></a></small></sup> A substance would have been a substance, 
though its duration had been but for a moment.<p>
(d) After having laboriously extracted from conflicting views the 
essential signification of the word, we can, if we hold by the true 
principles of human knowledge, assert that substance is a reality known 
to us beyond the shadow of a doubt. We may resolutely refuse the 
fetters offered to us by Mr. Huxley, when he propounds the doctrine 
that, "whether mind or matter has a substance or not, we are 
incompetent to discuss." We certainly know, besides God, a real world 
which cannot all be made up of mutually inherent accidents: there is in 
creation real Being, and the reality of Being implies substance, as 
Aristotle in the name of sound sense proclaimed: "It is clear that of 
the various 
<!--
260 TRANSCANDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p260"></a> 
kinds of Being the fundamental is that which answers to the question, 
What is it? and this signifies its <i>essence</i> or <i>substance</i>."<a name="n_49"><a href="#n49">{49}</a></a> 
He adds that always to inquire what a thing is, means to inquire 
what its substance is. Substance he properly looks upon as a real 
thing, not as a grammatical term meaning the same as subject in regard 
to predicate, or substantive in regard to adjective. He does indeed 
remark, of course without reference to mysteries like the Trinity and 
the Incarnation, that what he calls the "first substance" as 
distinguished from the "second substance," or a substance in the 
concrete and singular as distinginguished from substance in the 
abstract and universal, cannot be the predicate of anything else. 
"Socrates," for example, cannot be a predicate except to a synonym; but 
this observation is not all one with saying that substance means only 
grammatical subject In a sentence. Moreover, the reality of substance 
becomes certain to us, not only as regards the conscious self of each 
one of us, but also as regards other objects, whether personal or 
impersonal. We reject, therefore, as quite unphilosophical the 
limitation put by Mansel,<sup><small><a name="n50"><a href="#n_50">{50}</a></a></small></sup> that "beyond the range of conscious being 
we can have only a negative idea of substance," and that "in denying 
consciousness" we deny "the only form in which 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 261
--><A NAME="p261"></a> 
unity and substance have been presented to us," while between 
unconscious things "some kind of unity may exist, or it may not," but 
at any rate, we cannot come to the knowledge of it.<p>
In the end, then, we are in this position. The adversary thought to 
stop our assertion of substance by arguing that it is idle to affirm 
the existence of a mere mysterious, unknown something, which is 
distinct from all that manifests itself in experience. We elude the 
attempt so to baffle us partly by making substance independent of the 
question about a distinct <i>substratum</i>, and partly by showing that 
at least there are real accidents of the merely modal order which are 
distinct from their subject. With the exception that he says more of 
Locke than is unqualifiedly true, Rosmini gives a fair compendium of 
our doctrine:<sup><small><a name="n51"><a href="#n_51">{51}</a></a></small></sup> "In my opinion, substance was denied by Locke through 
a pure misconception, he imagining that more is required than is really 
the case. In fact, to have the idea of substance it is enough to know 
that there can be no modification without a subject modified. Now the 
idea of this subject is the idea of substance. But you may tell me, you 
do not know what the subject is: nay, further, that you cannot know it, 
for to you it is essentially an x. Still you know that it is the 
subject of such and such modifications, the cause of such and such 
effects, and what do you want more? It is true that if you strip this 
subject of its modifications, of its properties, of its effects, you 
have only 
<!--
262 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p262"></a> 
the x. remaining; but even then you will still have the idea of it, 
you know the relation which this x has with its perceived 
modifications. Such is the knowledge we have of substance considered in 
the abstract; nor have we a right to require more, since there is 
enough in that knowledge to give us the idea in question."<p>
The mention in this extract of "stripping the subject of its 
modifications" introduces a point yet to be explained as regards the 
reality of substance: for it is precisely the taunt which the school of 
Hume makes against us, that we know nothing but the modifications, and 
that if we take them away there is a blank left: if we remove all the 
attributes of a thing, then nothing is left. We must distinguish 
between attributes and attributes, and between removal and removal. 
Attributes strictly so called are the accidental modes of a substance, 
attributes in the wider sense include the substantial characters 
themselves, as when we say it is man's attribute to have a rational 
soul, or a nature compounded of body and soul, and when we say that it 
is God's attribute to be an infinite, self-existent Being. Now it would 
surely be a mere sophism to play up0n the uncertain use of a word, and 
because attribute in its larger meaning includes substance to pretend 
that there is no difference between substance and attribute in its 
narrower meaning. So much as to the two sorts of attributes: next as to 
the removal from substance of attributes strictly so called; for only 
with respect to them has the question any meaning. The removal may be 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 263 
--><A NAME="p263"></a> 
physical and it may be metaphysical or logical. Logically, or by mere 
mental abstraction, it is clear that we can remove the attributes and 
still have the concept of substance remaining. What must be confessed, 
however, is that this concept may be only very generic, such as 
substance, without further determination, material substance, living 
substance, &c. For as we declared in the chapter on Essences, our 
knowledge of them is often very imperfect and generic: so that we 
specify them, not by genuine specific differences, but by accidental 
differences, which suffice to mark off one kind of thing from another, 
without precisely indicating wherein the difference of kind consists. 
If, however, we take up the consideration of a physical removal, we 
find that some accidents can be removed and leave the substance intact, 
as when a ball loses its velocity, or a coal its heat, or a mind its 
thought. Created means suffice to bring about these removals; but how 
much further Divine power could go on stripping off accidents while the 
substance endured, we must not pretend to determine. Those who are fond 
of conjectures might conjecture, though they could not prove the parity 
of the two cases, that as in the Blessed Sacrament God leaves the 
accidents of bread without their substance, so He might leave the 
substance without any of its accidents. Some accidents at any rate He 
does remove in a way impossible to nature: for example, the quantity of 
Christ's Body is left without its connatural extension in space: the 
Sacred Body is just where the small, 
<!--
264 TRANSCENDRNTAL BRING. 
--><A NAME="p264"></a> 
round Host is, but it does not become correspondingly round and small.<p>
If, however, on matters like these we are powerless to answer the 
difficulties of objectors, they are equally powerless to make their 
difficulties effective against anything that we positively hold. They 
are ignorant, and so are we, in many things; but neither their nor our 
ignorance is a reason for renouncing the little knowledge that we can 
attain.<p>
We must not be thought to have conceded more than in fact we have. When 
we allowed that created faculties of action may, perhaps, be not really 
distinct from the substance under its dynamic aspect, we were not 
allowing that substance may, perhaps, be reduced to a continuous series 
of activities: that would be more like Hume's view, or Lotze's, who 
says.<sup><small><a name="n52"><a href="#n_52">{52}</a></a></small></sup> "Every soul is what it shows itself to be, a unity whose life 
is in definite ideas, feelings, and efforts." The faculties may be not 
really distinct from the substance: they may be the substance itself 
under the aspects of its various activities; but at any rate a 
substance there is, and in it the faculties are united, and we have not 
got mere unsubstantial activities by themselves. If by activities some 
authors mean substance having these activities, then they are on our 
side.<p>
After all that has been argued it is needless to enter into a special 
polemic against Kant's theory that substance is not a real object of 
knowledge, but a category of the understanding according to which we 
are obliged to think the 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 265 
--><A NAME="p265"></a> 
objects of our experience, without being sure that things in 
themselves are substances. It is the perversion of all right reason 
thus to turn our most evident objective conceptions into mere 
conditions of conceiving, and Kant himself is not always faithful to 
his extravagant resolution, to call insight into objective truth a mere 
form in which mind must act by reason of its subjective nature. Here is 
our great divergence from him: We hold that when we have before the 
mind the idea "substance," derived in the manner already explained, 
then to call such an idea a rule of our thinking, and an <i>a 
priori</i> form which, so far as we can ascertain, is without any 
counterpart in the region of objects, means simply to abdicate the 
empire of reason. For of nothing are we more convincingly assured than 
that such ideas are ideas, and therefore must represent to us some 
object; so that to degrade them to mere subjective rules would be 
equivalently to renounce all objectivity. The further urging of this 
point would require the repetition of nearly all that is laid down in 
<i>First Principles</i>; so we forbear to say more.<p>
As we conclude this account of Substance we can hardly fail to remark 
how vague is the attack of the adversaries on the point, how little 
they have of definite in their theory of substance except that it is an 
unknown <i>substratum</i>, something other than anything we come across 
in our experience of things, something which is the antithesis of all 
that we can predicate of known phenomena, and which therefore it is a 
contradiction in terms to pretead to know. 
<!--
266 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p266"></a> 
Whereas we have seen that the primal notion of substance is Being, 
which exists <i>per se</i>, in contradistinction to such realities as 
the figure or the velocity of a body, which clearly cannot exist <i>per 
se</i>. Hume, the great leader of revolt against substance, himself 
admits that we must affirm existences, <i>per se</i>, and as such he 
defines his "perceptions." So that while we teach that there is one 
substance of mind in each man, with many accidental modes, Hume teaches 
that there are as many distinct substances as there are "perceptions," 
the several perceptions being bound together by some indescribable law 
of association which is not a substance, and not an efficient 
causality, and not anything to which we can give a name except that of 
association. The unity of consciousness is impossible on these terms; 
the creations and the annihilations of substances, which must take 
place while the perceptions come into being and cease to be, are 
appalling; and the whole theory is manifestly absurd. Still it is 
accepted as part of modern wisdom, and like much more of modern wisdom, 
it is accepted with no very precise intelligence of what it means, or 
of what is the doctrine for which it is the substitute. In the name of 
right reason we adhere to the old idea of substance, <i>ens per se 
stans</i>.<p>
The idea thus vindicated will help to solve the difficulty of those who 
allow that our means of knowledge put us into some phenomenal relation 
with things outside us, so that we can adapt ourselves to external 
conditions, but who doubt whether 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 267 
--><A NAME="p267"></a> 
we have herein any real insight into the things themselves. If 
substance stands to its phenomenal manifestations in the way which we 
have partially indicated, then since we cannot know the phenomena 
without knowing something about outer reality, there are no unreal 
phenomena, either on the objective side or on the subjective side. Even 
mental illusions, so far as they are acts of mind, represent some 
objects, actual or possible. The one reality is not the mysterious 
<i>substratum</i> which nobody comes across: whatever impresses us must 
be real, as will appear more fully when in the next chapter we explain 
the doctrine of efficient causality, and as for the <i>substratum</i>, 
it is not the unapproachable thing which some strangely imagine.<p>
(4) The bulk of what we have to say about accidents has already been 
said while we were speaking of them in contrast to substance; but a few 
details have to be added in order to give further insight into the 
question. The schoolmen divide accidents into different orders, and 
some keen controversy arises out of the undertaking. They distinguish 
accidents into absolute and relative, as will be seen by an inspection 
of the nine Aristotelian categories which belong to accident. In the 
last chapter we will give the main outlines of the doctrine of 
relation. The great difficulty, however, springs up when absolute 
accidents are divided, as by Suarez,<sup><small><a name="n53"><a href="#n_53">{53}</a></a></small></sup> into those which are merely 
modal, so that not even by miracle could they be preserved apart from 
their substance, and those which by 
<!--
268 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p268"></a> 
miracle can be so preserved. The latter are hard not merely to 
imagine, but even intellectually to conceive, nor would their existence 
be so confidently affirmed if it were not for the mystery of the Holy 
Eucharist, which according to the more commonly received doctrine, 
presents an instance of quantity and qualities continuing to exist as 
accidents when their substance is gone. The question is, how to regard 
these so as not to make of them at least imperfect substances? For 
accident is described not as an entity, but as the entity of an entity; 
not as that <i>which is</i>, but as that <i>whereby a substance is in 
some way modified</i>. St. Thomas<sup><small><a name="n54"><a href="#n_54">{54}</a></a></small></sup> makes a distinction, saying that 
while "accident neither has the character of an essence, nor is a part 
of the essence as such," yet "just as it is a Being <i>secundum 
quid</i>, or after a manner, so it has an essence <i>secundum quid</i>, 
or after a manner." This is easily illustrated as regards the merely 
modal accidents; for example, the velocity of a bullet is certainly not 
identical with the substance of bullet, and yet its reality is to this 
extent identified with the bullet that it cannot be passed on, as 
numerically, physically the same velocity, to another bullet. The 
motion in the bullet may be destroyed, to give rise to other motions in 
other bodies, but there is no transfer of one identical motion. Now, if 
the merely modal accident has a reality, though this cannot otherwise 
be described than after the example just given, how do we know that 
even a higher reality may not be possible to 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 269 
--><A NAME="p269"></a> 
some accidents without taking away their character of accidents? 
Certainly we cannot demonstrate the opposite; and if the fact is proved 
by the Blessed Sacrament -- on which point theologians are not all 
agreed -- at least reason has nothing positive to object.<p>
Suarez is thought by many to have confused the subject by denying to 
mere modal accidents even such distinct reality as they have, and by 
giving to the more than modal accidents a distinction from their 
substance greater than they have. It is complained that he does not 
allow to the compound being, which is made up of substance and more 
than modal accident, its full unity of being; that he asserts too much 
of an actual distinction between substance and accident, while they are 
actually united; and that hence he is obliged to bring in his "modes of 
union" as third realities to unite the other two. These are very subtle 
questions, which it is suggestive to see stated, for they add to the 
range of our ideas about substance and accident; but we need not 
prolong the discussion of them here. Even if they should leave in the 
mind a sense of inability to come to a clear decision, they would not 
therefore upset so much of well-ascertained doctrine as we have 
previously established. That mind is very poorly educated which cannot 
put up with unexplained residua at the end of an inquiry which at least 
has explained part of what was being investigated; nor would a mystery, 
like that of the Holy Eucharst, be a mystery, if it were intelligible 
throughout. There is, then, no 
<!--
270 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p270"></a> 
need for going over to agnosticism, because we cannot hunt some 
notions down to their deepest recesses; just as there is no need to 
throw away the microscope because it, too, has its limits. A real 
distinction has been established between substance and accident, and 
that is a very useful piece of philosophic knowledge; perhaps, an 
unsolved difficulty has been encountered, and that also is a very 
useful piece of philosophic experience.<p>
NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.<p>
(1) Our English philosophers have so fixed on Substance as a matter of 
discussion, and so perverted the notion, that a little more about their 
doctrines may be acceptable to readers who have an inquisitiveness 
concerning the disputes which have gathered round this important topic.<p>
(a) James Mill regards substance as a mental fiction, which we might go 
on multiplying for ever, asserting subject after subject, inherence 
after inherence; and he puts the whole down to his favourite process of 
association, whereby he accounts for nearly everything. By association 
every event calls up the idea of an antecedent or cause, whether this 
be conceived definitely or only indefinitely, and in the most general 
terms.<sup><small><a name="n55"><a href="#n_55">{55}</a></a></small></sup> "Of this most remarkable case of association, that which we 
call our belief in external objects is one of the most remarkable 
instances. Of the sensations of sight, of handling, of smell, of taste, 
which I have from a rose, each is an event: with each of these events I 
associate the idea of a constant antecedent, a cause." Thus the quality 
of red is regarded as the cause of the sensation of red; the 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 271 
--><A NAME="p271"></a> 
qualities of coexistence and extension as the causes of the sensations 
of touch; the qualities of odour and taste as the causes of 
corresponding sensations. Here quality always stands for an unknown 
cause or antecedent. "Such is one part of the process. Another is that 
by which the ideas of those sensations are so intimately united as to 
appear, not several ideas, but one idea, the idea of a rose. We have 
now two steps of association: that of the several sensations into one 
idea, and that of the several sensations each with a separate cause. 
But we do not stop here:" for <i>theoretically</i> we go on ever 
supposing antecedents beyond antecedents, because we never can regard 
any antecedent as ultimate, Practically, however, we do stop at the 
notion of a <i>substratum</i>. "The ideas of a number of sensations, 
concomitant in a certain way, are combined into a single idea, as that 
of a rose or an apple. The unity which is thus given to the effect is, 
of course, transferred to the supposed cause, called qualities: they 
are referred to a common cause. To this supposed cause of supposed 
causes we give a name <i>substratum</i>. It is obvious that there is no 
reason for stopping at this <i>substratum</i>; for, as the sensation 
suggested the quality, and the quality the <i>substratum</i>, so the 
<i>substratum</i> as properly leads to another antecedent, another 
<i>substratum</i>, and so on from <i>substratum</i> to 
<i>substratum</i> without end. These inseparable associations, however, 
rarely go on beyond a single step, hardly ever beyond two."<p>
This is known as "the regressive process," and is a sore puzzle to 
puzzle-headed philosophers, but one entirely of their own invention. On 
the rational explanation that there is one primal Substance, the 
creator of secondary substances, and that substance in each case is 
what exists <i>per se</i>, the difficulty quite vanishes. It may look 
very terrible at first to hear that thought 
<!--
272 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p272"></a> 
is within faculty, and faculty within mind, and mind within the soul, 
and the soul within man, and humanity within substance; but some of 
these distinctions are logical, not real, and even the logical 
distinctions must come to an end when any further repetition of them 
serves no rational purpose. Hence we listen unsympathetically to 
complaints like that of Green:<sup><small><a name="n56"><a href="#n_56">{56}</a></a></small></sup> "From mind, as receptive of and 
operative about ideas, is distinguished mind as 'the substance within 
us,' of which consciousness is an 'operation' that it sometimes 
exercises and sometimes does not: and from this thinking substance 
again is distinguished the man who 'finds it in himself,' and carries 
it about with him in a coach or on horseback, -- the person 'consisting 
of a soul and body,' who is prone to sleep, and in sound sleep is 
unconscious.<p>
(b) In his <i>Logic</i>, when he tries to keep clear of metaphysical 
controversies, John S. Mill over and above <i>phenomena</i> allows the 
knowable existence of the <i>noumenon</i>, about which we can make a 
few predications.<sup><small><a name="n57"><a href="#n_57">{57}</a></a></small></sup> "Sequences and coexistences are not only asserted 
respecting phenomena; <i>we may make propositions also respecting those 
hidden causes of phenomena which are named substances and 
attributes</i>. A substance, however, being to us nothing but either 
that which causes, or that which is conscious of, phenomena; and the 
same being true, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, of attributes; no assertion 
can be made, at least with a meaning, concerning those unknown and 
unknowable entities, except in virtue of the phenomena by which alone 
they manifest themselves to our faculties. When we say Socrates was 
contemporary with the Peloponnesian War, the foundation of this 
assertion, as of all assertions concerning substance, is an assertion 
concerning the phenomena which they exhibit 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 273 
--><A NAME="p273"></a> 
<i>Still the proposition does not assert that alone: it asserts that 
the thing in itself, the noumenon Socrates was existing, and doing, or 
experiencing various facts during the same time. Coexistence and 
sequence, therefore, may be affirmed and denied, not only between 
phenomena, but between noumena, or between a noumenon and phenomena. 
And both of noumena and phenomena we may affirm simple existence.</i> 
But what is a noumenon? An unknown cause. In affirming, therefore, the 
existence of a noumenon, we affirm causation." This knowledge of the 
unknown is a curious piece of philosophy, which is not made less 
curious by the assertion that whereas "of noumena we may affirm simple 
existence," as also "coexistence and sequence," yet "existence has to 
us no meaning but one which has relation to phenomena,"<sup><small><a name="n58"><a href="#n_58">{58}</a></a></small></sup> for "as we 
conceive it, it is merely the power of producing phenomena." To noumena 
he professes to be unable to apply the fundamental principles of 
identity, contradiction, and excluded middle: the reason being, that 
"we are entirely ignorant" whether these "laws of thought are laws of 
existence too." No wonder Mr. Mill is anxious to escape from this 
perplexed state of things; so that in his <i>Logic</i> he claims a 
position of neutrality:<sup><small><a name="n59"><a href="#n_59">{59}</a></a></small></sup> "With the opinion which denies noumena I 
have, as a metaphysician, no quarrel: but whether it be true or false 
is irrelevant to Logic:" in which sentence, it is fair to add, that he 
is speaking of the "outer world" only, and does not undertake to say 
that it has any existence outside our sensations. "We know nothing, and 
can know absolutely nothing, except the sensations which we experi<!--
274 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p274"></a>ence from it: the distinctions which we verbally make between the 
properties of things and the sensations we receive from them, must 
originate in the convenience of discourse, rather than in the nature of 
what is signified by the terms."<sup><small><a name="n60"><a href="#n_60">{60}</a></a></small></sup><p>
(c) Lewes, in his <i>Problems of Life and Mind</i>, suffers from the 
ordinary scare about an <i>unknown substratum</i>. "All we positively 
know of matter is what its qualities are: and if we group them into a 
general synthesis, naming the group matter, we are not entitled to 
infer anything more than is given in the particulars thus grouped. 
Metaphysicians are, for the most part, all actively engaged in trying 
to solve the problem of matter by disregarding the known functions, and 
theorizing on the unknown quantity, disdaining the observabie 
phenomena." However, Lewes cannot agree with Hume's reduction of the 
mind to an unsubstantial series of states; though, as we have seen 
before, Hume calls each state a substance so far as it is something 
which exists by itself. "In denying a mental substratum," says the 
critic,<sup><small><a name="n61"><a href="#n_61">{61}</a></a></small></sup> "Hume was left in a condition of absolute scepticism: he 
gave a logical unity to consciousness, and supposed that this logical 
unity was all that was meant when men spoke of real unity."<p>
(d) A short sentence from Mr. Spencer will give an insight into his 
theory of substance:<sup><small><a name="n62"><a href="#n_62">{62}</a></a></small></sup> "Existence means nothing more than persistence; 
and hence in mind that which persists in spite of all changes, and 
maintains the unity of the aggregate in defiance of all attempts to 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 275 
--><A NAME="p275"></a> 
divide it, is that of which existence in the full sense of the word 
must be predicated -- that which we must postulate as the substance of 
mind in contradistinction to the varying forms it assumes. But, if so, 
the impossibility of knowing the substance of mind is manifest." This 
"substance of mind" is an "indefinite consciousness," "the raw material 
of thought," which becomes thought as soon as it receives any definite 
determination by concrete experience. The Unknown Power is ultimately 
the substance of all things: a doctrine which we have to bear in mind 
lest we take as too satisfactory sentences which seem to meet our own 
views as exactly as does the following:<sup><small><a name="n63"><a href="#n_63">{63}</a></a></small></sup> "It is rigorously impossible 
to conceive that our knowledge is a knowledge of appearances only, 
without at the same time conceiving a reality of which they are the 
appearances; for appearances without reality are unthinkable."<p>
(e) In his <i>Prolegomena Ethica</i>, Green says:<sup><small><a name="n64"><a href="#n_64">{64}</a></a></small></sup> "Substance is 
that which is persistent throughout certain appearances. It represents 
the identical element throughout appearances, that permanent element 
throughout the times of their appearances, in virtue of which they are 
not so many different appearances, but connected changes. A material 
substance is that which remains the same with itself in respect of some 
of the qualities which we include in our definition of matter -- 
qualities all consisting in some kind of relation -- while in other 
respects it changes. Its character as a substance depends on that 
relation of appearances to each other in a single order which renders 
them changes. It is not that first there is a substance, and then 
certain changes of it ensue. The substance is the implication of the 
changes, and has no existence otherwise. Apart from the substance no 
changes, any more than apart 
<!--
276 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p276"></a> 
from the effects any cause. If we choose to say that matter exists as 
a substance, we merely substitute for the designation of it as 
consisting in relations, a designation of it as a certain 
<i>correlatum</i> of a certain kind of relation. Its existence as a 
substance depends on the action of the same self-consciousness upon 
which the connexion of phenomena by means of that relation depends." We 
have shown that permanence under change is not the essential idea of 
substance, and Green's reduction of material substance to relations 
constituted by the intellect is too idealistic to meet our approval.<p>
(f) Mr. M'Cosh, in getting rid of the unknown substratum as a mere 
bugbear to Philosophy, gives three requisites for substance. "In saying 
that the mind is substance we mean nothing more but that in us and in 
others there is (1) an existing thing, (2) operating, (3) with a 
permanence. It is high time that those metaphysicians, who defend 
radical truth, should abandon this unknown and unknowable substratum or 
noumenon, which has ever been a foundation of ice to those who built 
upon it. Sir W. Hamilton having handed over this unknown thing to 
faith, Mr. Spencer has confined religion to it as to its grave. We 
never know quality without knowing substance, just as we cannot know 
substance without knowing quality. Both are known in one concrete act; 
we may, however, separate them in thought. Taking this view, we cannot, 
without protest, allow persons to speak of substance as being something 
unknown, mysterious, lying far down in a depth below human inspection. 
The substance is known quite as much as the quality. We never see an 
appearance (phenomenon) apart from a thing appearing (noumenon). I 
understand what is meant by <i>the thing</i>: it is the object 
existing. But what is meant by <i>the-thing-in-<!--
SUBSTANCE AND ACCIDENT. 277 
--><A NAME="p277"></a>itself</i>? If <i>Ding-an-sich</i> means that there is a thing in 
addition to the thing as it manifests itself, and as it exercises 
property, I allow that for aught I know there may be such a thing; but 
believing that no other man on mere philosophic grounds knows any more 
about it than I do, I protest against it being represented as a support 
of the thing known, or in any way essential to it."<p>
We have here an admirable lesson as to the attitude which Philosophy 
should take to Theology. Philosophically Mr. M'Cosh sees no proof for 
the distinct substratum; neither does he see disproof: therefore his 
attitude ought to be one of ready acceptance of anything which may 
appear demonstrable from theologic sources in regard to the distinction 
between substance and accidents,<p>
(2) Lotze,<sup><small><a name="n65"><a href="#n_65">{65}</a></a></small></sup> however badly he may define the term, claims substance 
as distinctly a matter of experience. "It has been required of any 
theory which starts from the basis of experience, that in the beginning 
it should speak only of sensations and ideas, without mentioning the 
soul to which, it is said, we hasten without justification to ascribe 
them. I should maintain, on the contrary, that such a mode of setting 
out involves a wilful departure from that which is actually given in 
experience. A mere sensation without a subject is nowhere to be met 
with as a fact. It is impossible to meet with a bare movement without 
thinking of the mass whose movement it is; and it is just as impossible 
to conceive a sensation existing without the accompanying idea of that 
which has it -- or rather, of that which feels it, for this also is 
included in the given fact of experience, that the relation of the 
feeling subject to its feeling, whatever its other characteristics may 
be, is in any case something different from the relation of the 
<!--
278 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p278"></a> 
moved element to its movement. It is thus, and thus only, that 
sensation is a given fact; and we have no right to abstract from its 
relation to its subject because this relation is puzzling, and because 
we wish to obtain a starting-point which looks more convenient, but is 
utterly unwarranted by experience. In saying this, I do not wish to 
repeat the frequent but exaggerated assertion, that in every single act 
of feeling or thinking there is an <i>express</i> consciousness which 
regards the sensation or idea simply as states of a self: on the 
contrary, every one is familiar with that absorption in the context of 
a sensuous perception which makes us forget our personality."<p>
(3) Great stress is laid by adversaries on the assertion that if any 
substance were made known to us, it would be our own; but that about 
our own selves consciousness testifies only that there are successive 
states. We answer that these states are reported to us, not in the 
abstract, but in the concrete, and that the most simple analysis, by 
reflexion, of what is involved in them, gives us the two elements -- 
permanent substance and its variable modifications at successive times. 
It is enough if we settle that there is some substance of self: for the 
purposes of General Metaphysics are satisfied if we prove only that 
<i>the most generic</i> concept of substance is real; as to our 
knowledge of <i>specific</i> substances, that, after the establishment 
of substance in general, may be judged by what has before been said in 
the chapter on Essences. Locke, therefore, allowed what we are 
contending for when he allowed that we are certain of a 
<i>substratum</i> and of its reality.<p>
