THREE ATTRIBUTES OF BEING,<br>
NAMELY, UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS.</h4></center><ul><p>
<i>Synopsis.</i><p>
(1) Every Being is one: in connexion with which property 
various terms have to be explained. (a) Unity is transcendental, 
predicamental, mathematical. (b) Unity is specific and individual. (c) 
Unity is real or mental. (d) Unity is distinguished from uniqueness. (c) 
Allied with unity is identity. (f) To unity is opposed distinction.<p>
(2) Every Being is true. (a) Establishment of the proposition. (b) The 
truth of Being is not a reality superadded to it, but is Being itself 
in its relation to the intellect. (c) This relation may he made either 
to the creative or to the created intellect. (d) Objections do not 
upset the doctrine.<p>
(3) Every Being is good. (a) A disputed question of priority between 
the good and Being. (b) How and why every Being is good. (c) Not every 
Being is equally good, and what is more, evil is a reality which has 
to be explained in harmony with the goodness of all Being as such. 
(d) With the good is closely connected the idea of the Beautiful.<p>
(4) Hegelian opposition to our three attributes of Being.<p>
<i>Notes and Illustrations.</i></ul><p>
OUR work is now to assign attributes to Being, in which procedure we 
must be careful to assert no properties but such as belong to Being 
<i>qua</i> Being, and are co-extensive with the transcendental term 
itself, which passes over all boundaries and quite 
<!--
94 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p94"></a>
disregards the distinction sometimes drawn between Things and Persons. 
Persons are Things as we are now viewing them, and Being is anything 
and everything that is real. The attributes of Being, then, must form 
no addition to its reality, they must be identical with it, not only in 
the sense that all the determinations of Being are themselves, through 
and through, Being, but also in the sense that the attributes are given 
by the consideration of simple Being, apart from any of its special 
determinations. The attributes of Being must be only Being itself, 
taken in one or other of its real aspects. They are Unity, Truth, and 
Goodness, and shall now be declared in due order.<p>
(1) Every Being is one, an assertion which sounds like a tautology, 
when we consider that "every" means each taken singly, and that we are 
talking of Being in the singular, not of Beings in the plural. Our 
English indefinite article to some extent, and still more the French 
indefinite article, <i>un</i>, enforce the recognition of the oneness: 
"A Being is one" -- <i>Un &ecirc;tre est</i> un.<p>
One is a simple notion, irresolvable into two ideas more elementary 
than itself; and hence it is to be described, when not by its synonyms, 
then by reference to its opposite. The opposite of the oneness claimed 
for Being is <i>division</i>; thus oneness is said to mean indivision. 
Now some Beings are undivided in such sort that they are indivisible, 
which gives us the most perfect unity of a simple Being. Other Beings 
are undivided, yet divisible, as body and soul in man; and this is 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 95 
--><A NAME="p95"></a>
the less perfect unity, the unity of composition, which has the higher 
form of unity when it is substantial as compared with accidental. How 
intimate is the union which the schoolmen assert in a compound 
substance, will not be understood by those who have before the mind 
only the notion of elements specially aggregated, and combining their 
intrinsically unchanged forces so as to produce a resultant unlike any 
of the single components. With the scholastics, every Being that forms 
a distinct nature is determined to be what it is by a <i>substantial 
form</i> which permeates the whole, and is, so far as its own nature 
alone is concerned, indivisible and without parts. Thus it constitutes 
a <i>unum per se</i> as distinguished from a <i>unum per accidens</i>; 
the unity of what is strictly a Being as distinguished from a 
combination of Beings. Such at least is the scholastic conception; and 
though its merits have not to be discussed in this place, mention of it 
is necessary in order to convey the full idea of what is meant by the 
majority of the schoolmen under the proposition, "Every Being is one." 
On any system, however, such as is the bond which is supposed to give 
unity to the compound, such also will be the unity itself which is 
asserted of the whole Being; while as for simple Being its unity is 
clear.<p>
St. Thomas furnishes, in few words, a statement and a proof of the 
unity of each Being.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> "The One is nothing but undivided Being, for it 
adds to Being only the negation of division." Being, which is thus 
undivided in itself, is also divided from all others 
<!--
96 BEING.
--><A NAME="p96"></a>
-- "indivisum in se et divisum a quolibet alio." The latter part of 
the phrase St. Thomas thinks to be well expressed by <i>aliquid</i>, 
which he takes to mean "something other;" but the more correct meaning 
seems that of the indefinite pronoun, "something or other." His proof 
of the unity of Being runs thus:<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> "<i>One</i> is convertible with 
<i>Being</i>. For every Being is either simple or compound; but what 
is simple is undivided both as to act and potentiality; and what is 
compound is not a Being as long as its parts are divided, since it 
becomes such only when they form the compound. Manifestly, therefore, 
the Being of everything is undivided, and the thing keeps its Being 
only as it keeps its unity."<p>
If this account of the oneness of Being should seem a mere ringing of 
the changes on a few simple ideas, it must be remembered that 
professedly we are dealing with our most elementary conceptions, in 
regard to which there is ample justification for laying down explicitly 
in synonyms their meanings and inter-relations, because experience 
abundantly shows what great confusion may be introduced, even among the 
very elements of thought. Besides, in connexion with the notion of 
unity, its varieties and its kindred terms call for explanation, which 
accordingly we proceed to give under a succession of headings. The 
principles which will guide our selection deserve mention. <i>A 
priori</i> it is always difficult to settle what connected or 
collateral questions are admissible into the discussion of a central 
idea, and what not; for as everything has 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 97
--><A NAME="p97"></a>
some relation to everything else, it becomes possible to drag in any 
topic as having a sort of bearing on the main point. But experience 
steps in as a guide, and knowing from it what terms related with unity 
are of frequent recurrence in philosophical discussion, we pick out 
these as practically recommended to our notice. Add to this a little 
"sweet reasonableness," and we have all we want for guidance in making 
a selection.<p>
(a) <i>Transcendental Unity</i> is nearly identical with mathematical 
or with predicamental<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> unity, but there is some distinction. The 
former is proper to every Being because of its indivision; whereas the 
latter is grounded strictly on extension or quantity, which, because of 
its divisibility, gives rise to multiplicity. Hence numerical unity is 
the foundation of number which, when integral, consists of a 
progressive addition of units in this shape:<p>
<center>
<table><tr><td><tt>
2 = 1 + 1<br>
3 = 2 + 1<br>
4 = 3 + 1<br>
5 = 4 + 1<br>
6 = 5 + 1<br>
</tt></td></tr></table>
</center><p>
Hence number is defined as "multitude measured by unity," and such 
unity is called mathematical. Secondarily, however, and analogously 
numerical unity is applied to unextended objects, so that we may number 
angels as well as men, and speak of "the seven who stand before the 
throne," or of the
<!--
98 BEING 
--><A NAME="p98"></a>
proportion of the faithless angels to those "faithful found." Indeed, 
number is said to be just one of those ideas which can be most easily 
fitted on to all things; from which fact certain interpreters would, in 
part, account for the Pythagorean attempt to treat numbers as the 
constituents of all objects. Mr. Bosanquet is much impressed with 
numerical proportion as an element in the recognition of things. "All 
intelligent recognition of individual objects," he says, "depends on 
proportion, or on some principle which involves proportion. All things 
have aspects and effects which find generalized expression in number. 
Shorten a snipe's beak, take one from the divisions of the
horse-chestnut leaf, or misplace. the accent on an English word, and 
recognition fails or falters. . . . I very much doubt if the element of 
proportion, both external as in size compared with surroundings, and 
internal as in shape, symmetry, or harmony of sound or colour, is ever 
absent in a recognitive perception of an individual thing."<p>
To individuality we next turn our attention.<p>
(b) Unity is either <i>specific</i> or <i>individual</i>; and inasmuch 
as the species of a thing is settled by what the scholastics call its 
<i>form</i>, for specific unity we sometimes read <i>formal</i>. By his 
specific unity Peter is a man, and not of any nature other than human: 
he can belong to only one species, not to several conjointly or 
mixedly. He is one nature undivided in itself and divided off from 
every non-human nature. On the other side, by his individual unity he 
is this particular man, and not any other member of his 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 99
--><A NAME="p99"></a>
own species, he is Peter, not James, or John: also he is one man only, 
and not both one and several together. To apply Bentham's principle, 
"Every man counts for one, and no man counts for more than one." Some 
place in opposition to individual, essential unity, whereby an essence 
cannot be divided into several essences, all of one kind: they might 
also call this the <i>specific</i> unity; but in the absence of 
uniformity among authors, we have suited our own convenience in the 
terms which we have chosen to use. Mentally we may distinguish 
individual from specific unity, as is proved by the fact we have just 
done so; but physically and in the concrete man, according to what 
seems the most reasonable view, nature and individuality are not really 
distinct. Still the Scotists manage to argue for a distinction here of 
a very diminutive yet real order -- a distinction not as between thing 
and thing, but as between what scoffers might call <i>thingum</i> and 
<i>thingum</i>. Thus at least they might parody the asserted difference 
of <i>realitates</i> where there is no difference of <i>res</i>. What 
those who regard the matter seriously have to say for themselves is, 
that one and the same <i>thing (res)</i> may contain under its 
undivided unity <i>as thing</i>, really distinct <i>realitates</i> or 
<i>formalitates</i>; the test of such real distinction being a 
plurality of objective concepts. If, say they, to one thing we can 
truly apply two or more concepts of different meanings, this is a sign 
of some real distinction in the thing, though it may not be a sign of 
two really distinct things. Thus, in the case before us, an individual 
man is <i>one thing</i>,
<!--
100 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p100"></a>
but the objective concept of his individuality is not the objective 
concept of his humanity; the two ideas have different contents or 
"comprehensions;" therefore they point to some real, though 
subordinate, distinction in the object itself.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> In reply it is 
argued, first, that this theory, by making the individuality really 
other than the nature, would make the concrete nature, as far as itself 
alone was concerned, a universal <i>a parte rei</i> -- an absurd 
position; -- and next, that a distinction less than real will meet all 
the requirements of the case. For, intermediate between the distinction 
which exists in the thing itself and the distinction which is 
constituted by mind alone with its power of abstraction, there is the 
distinction which the mind indeed first completes, but for which the 
thing itself furnishes the foundation. This is called the virtual 
distinction, or <i>distinctio rationis cum fundamento in re</i>, or the 
<i>distinctio rationis ratiocinatae</i>,<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> the test of which is, that 
while the thing itself has not the distinction, it does give ground for 
it, because it offers to the mind an object of consideration to which 
two ideas, not mutually inclusive, can be applied. Thus, looking at any 
individual man, we may conceive apart his <i>humanity</i> specifically, 
and his <i>thisness</i> individually;  
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 101
--><A NAME="p101"></a>
our two concepts are distinct, the imperfection of our faculties 
forcing us to do, so to speak, <i>at twice</i>, what a perfect 
intellect would do <i>at once</i> by an intuition of the individuality 
itself, along with the concrete nature with which it is identified. But 
we do not, therefore, with the Scotists assert that there are two 
realities in the thing, answering to our duality of concepts. Besides 
this controversy with the Scotists, there arises another with some 
Thomists who, not on Scotist grounds, but on the basis of their 
doctrine about <i>materia signata</i>, assert a real distinction 
butween an actually existent nature among created things and its 
individuality. We do not here enter into the discussion; but we are not 
afraid to say that we can see no intelligible sense in which a really 
distinct principle of individualization can be maintained. To us 
individuality appears identical with the concrete nature.<p>
(c) A third division of unity is into <i>physical</i> and <i>mental</i> 
or <i>moral</i>. A unity is physical so far as it has or may have place 
in things, independently of the mind conceiving it: it is <i>mental</i> 
so far as it is not completed except by becoming the object of the mind 
thinking, and sometimes also of the will wishing. One form of mental 
unity is that which belongs to several objects because of their 
inclusion under one class-concept; so the members of our race are all 
contained under the term <i>man</i>. This is the logical unity of the 
universal concept. Another mental unity is often called moral, because 
its bond is in the intelligence and the will of moral
<!--
102 BEING.  
--><A NAME="p102"></a>
agents; who, for example, voluntarily hold together in a benevolent 
society, or even in civil society, so far as the latter is not due to 
mere physical constraint. A fighting chief sometimes keeps his 
tribesmen together by something more than moral ties.<p>
(d) Unity is not quite uniqueness, though every concrete unit will be 
unique to this extent, that its individuality cannot be duplicated, or 
it would not be what it is called. But generally a thing is unique 
which has not got its like; if it merely has not its like but might 
have it, the uniqueness is a contingent fact; if it could not have its 
like, the uniqueness is essential, and only God is thus unique.<p>
(e) The mention of the word "like" brings us to the discussion of 
similarity in its relation to identity or sameness. Occasionally we 
have it disputed whether we may speak of separate objects as the same, 
or of the same event as recurring at successive intervals. Here we deem 
it unnecessary, and not in accordance with generally received usage, to 
preserve Aristotle's distinction of <i>likeness</i> in accidental 
quality (<b>homoia h&ocirc;n he poiot&ecirc;s mia</b>) from sameness in 
essential constituents (<b>tauta h&ocirc;n mia h&ecirc; ousia</b>). 
Therefore, we take the liberty to assert <i>sameness</i> between 
separate objects, on the understanding that we mean sameness whether of 
<i>kind</i> or of <i>quality</i>, not <i>numerical</i> sameness; and 
that whether it is kind or whether it is quality that is meant, must 
appear from the context in which the term occurs. The same numerical 
act can never be repeated, though some have fancied that this is 
possible 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 103 
--><A NAME="p103"></a>
by Divine power; the same numerical object cannot be duplicated; but 
specifically or qualitatively the same act can be repeated, and the 
same object can have its duplicate. Again, so far as a substance 
continues <i>identical with itself</i>, physically the same ornaments 
may appear at an annual celebration for many generations. As a fact, 
the toughest materials are sure to undergo some change from wear and 
tear; but these minutiae may be disregarded, on the principle <i>parvum 
pro nihilo reputatur</i>, "a trifle counts for nothing." If it be urged 
against the continued identity of a single object, that identity is a 
relation, and that a relation requires two terms, we reply that on the 
side of the continued identity of a thing with itself, the two terms 
are sufficiently supplied by the existence of the one thing at 
different times: or even at one and the same time we may make, at 
least, a logical distinction between subject and predicate, and say 
<i>A</i> is identical with <i>A</i>. If it be further pressed upon us 
that identity, in the sense of likeness, is often predicated where the 
likeness is far from complete, the answer is that often we are 
satisfied with a superficial or partial likeness, as when we affirm of 
a certain event that it is history repeating itself. All we mean is 
that there are strong points of resemblance, and we are content to 
fasten upon these, to the neglect of perhaps equally conspicuous 
dissimilarities. We conclude, then, that the philosophic rule for 
predicating <i>identity</i> and sameness is not hard to discover; the 
real difficulties, when they occur, will fall upon physical 
investigation. A moral identity is one where, according 
<!--
104 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p104"></a>
to the common estimate, the thing, though really changed, is reputed 
the same, as a river, an often-mended garment, a restored cathedral.<p>
(f) We may end the present section of our subject with an idea implied 
in the opposite of the notion from which we started: transcendental 
unity has division for its opposite, and division implies 
<i>distinction</i>. Distinction is defined "the absence of unity 
between a plurality of objects." In another shape, "those objects are 
<i>distinct</i>, of which one is not the other." All physically 
<i>separate</i> objects are evidently distinct; but there may be 
<i>real distinction</i> of objects where there is not actual 
<i>separation</i>, as between the soul and the body of a living man. 
Real distinction is constituted by the existence of some 
differentiating character, which is independent of the mind's 
advertence to it, and is not the creature of the mind's abstracting 
power. For instance, in a perfectly desert spot, which no man knows, 
the kernel of a nut on the tree would be really distinct from the 
shell, because <i>a parte rei</i>, "one is not the other." Real 
distinction has been subdivided into <i>major</i> and <i>minor</i>, 
whereupon unfortunately sharp controversies have arisen. Taking the 
liberty to settle our own use of terms, we may call that the 
<i>major</i> distinction which holds between what can be regarded as 
two different entities, whether these are each complete Beings in 
themselves or otherwise. But since it may be disputed whether every 
really distinct component will <i>ipso facto</i> deserve to be called 
an entity on its own account, we will give the alternative description, 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 105 
--><A NAME="p105"></a>
that the major distinction holds between different objects, each of 
which has more than a merely modal existence of its own. Then the 
<i>minor</i> real distinction will lie between an entity and its own 
merely modal realities, which are described as rather entities of that 
entity than simple entities, and which not even by miracle could be 
sustained apart from their subject. As an illustration, take the 
terrific speed of a cannon-ball. The velocity is a modal reality which 
may be present or absent from the projectile, and therefore is not 
simply identified with it; while it exists it is an <i>ens entis</i>: 
it has not Being of its own, but is the mode of a Being, which can 
exist without it. Yet this mode is not simply nothing, or it would not 
make all the difference between an easily supportable weight and a 
destroying momentum, which hardly the strongest armour-plate can 
withstand. Whether between the substantial and the merely modal reality 
there can be enumerated an intermediate one, such as the accident of 
quantity, according to the scholastic conception, depends on the 
doctrine held about the constitution of bodies: and we shall speak of 
it again in the chapter on Substance.<p>
Next to <i>real</i> let us take <i>mental</i> distinction. If it is 
purely of the mind's creation, it is called <i>distinctio rationis 
ratiocinantis</i>. To find a quite satisfactory example is not so easy; 
but we may instance the case of synonyms and definitions, or cases 
where we employ different names for one object without reference to the 
varying <i>signfication</i> of the words, but only to their one constant 
<!--
106 BEING.  
--><A NAME="p106"></a>
"supposition."<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> Thus the "supposition," or the object for which the 
names stand is kept the same, but the signification changes when we use 
the terms "moon" (the measurer), "luna" (the shining one), "our 
satellite," "the queen of night," "Artemis," "the silvery crescent." As 
etymologists teach us, names first indicate clearly a definite aspect 
of something: then this indication is blurred and lost; in the end, the 
word stands for the thing, as we say, "without a meaning." "Heavens," a 
person might say, is a term "standing for the sky," but telling us 
nothing about it; Max M&uuml;ller would interpose that the word means 
what is "heaved up on high." After different names have grown 
practically synonymous, it is a <i>distinctio rationis 
ratiocinantis</i>, a merely mental distinction, that we place between 
them: "heavens," "sky," firmament," "welkin" -- they are all one in 
sense to the ordinary understanding. Similarly, if we take names and 
titles of persons, there is only a distinction <i>rationis 
ratiocinantis</i> between Cicero and Tully; Queen of England and 
Empress of India; six and half a dozen; the subject and the predicate 
in the identical proposition, "business is business." More importance 
is attached to the <i>distinctio rationis ratiocinatae</i> or <i>cum 
fundamento in re</i>. Its test, at least in all finite things, is that 
whereas the distinction is not found ready made in the thing as such, 
yet this single thing does offer to the mind the ground for  
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH AND GOODNESS. 107  
--><A NAME="p107"></a>
forming two concepts, of which one does not include the other. To 
recur to an example already used. This physical man is one individual 
nature: in him "man" and "individual" are not two different realities: 
yet the concept "man" is not the concept "individual:" the pair of 
ideas are objectively diverse, so far as each has its different 
meaning, though they are objectively identical so far as the two are 
verified in one identical object. Hence the distinction has to be 
established by abstraction in thought: but the thing itself is really 
what each of the separate predicates declares it to be.<p>
The Infinity and the perfect simplicity of God have led to special 
explanations of how the virtual distinction, or the <i>distinctio 
rationis ratiocinatae</i>, can be applied to Him; but these we must 
leave to Natural Theology. To the Scotist distinction, however, we must 
pay a little attention, because when it previously came under our 
notice, we promised to give it further examination in due season. We 
saw that the Scotists within what, as <i>a thing</i>, is undifferenced, 
profess to find actually different "realitates," which they also call 
"formalitates." The meaning of <i>formalities</i> here needs to be 
accounted for; it will appear if we consider what it is to take a term 
<i>formally</i>. We take it formally when we take it as <i>this</i> or 
<i>that</i> thing in particular: individuality when considered 
precisely as <i>individuality</i>, humanity when considered precisely 
as <i>humanity</i>, are taken formally: they are taken exactly in the 
meaning of the words according to "comprehension;" they are considered 
according to the exact <i>form</i> which 
<!--
108 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p108"></a>
determines them to be what they are as signs. At once it can be shown 
that, though the "individual man," Peter, is one undifferenced object, 
yet the individuality, <i>considered formally as the individuality</i>, 
is not the humanity <i>considered formally as the humanity</i>. Hence 
the Scotists argue that there must be some real difference between them 
<i>a parte rei</i>, in the object itself: it need not be a difference 
between thing and thing, but at least it is a difference between a real 
formality and another real formality in one thing. Their opponents deny 
that the conclusion follows from the premisses: they affirm that our 
method of abstracting one aspect from another is such, that two 
different aspects can be taken of an object which in itself presents no 
real distinction of its own, to correspond with that which mentally we 
make. Of itself it offers to the mind a ground for drawing the 
distinction, but it does not do more. There is, then, a 
<i>virtual</i><sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> distinction, but there is not an <i>actual</i> one. 
This explanation seems intelligibly to meet all the requirements of the 
case; whereas the Scotist distinction between <i>res</i> and 
<i>realitas</i> is an enigma, which its proposers have no right to 
force upon our acceptance. Either they mean no more than our 
explanation admits, or if they do mean more the addition is 
unacceptable. For it would drive us to suppose, that wherever the 
weakness of our intelligence obliges us to conceive an object by a 
succession of ideas, one of which does not include the notes contained 
in another, there we  
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 109 
--><A NAME="p109"></a>
come across some actual distinction in the object conceived. A 
doctrine which fits in better with a sound system of philosophy is, 
that what in itself is undistinguished is to us distinguishable by 
mental abstraction. Indeed, it gives us an insight into the nature of 
our minds to be made aware of the partial, piecemeal way in which we 
have to gather our knowledge, dividing objects which in themselves are 
not so divided. If it has been a fault of scholasticism to attribute 
over-freely to things distinctions that are but mental, the detection 
of this error should render us cautious in taking up too readily a 
doctrine like that of the Scotists. At the same time, the extreme 
minuteness with which the scholastics have tried to trace ascending 
degrees of reality in the distinctions which the intellect draws, and 
to mark off real from non-real distinctions, is a refutation of the 
charge which is sometimes made wholesale, that the scholastics rashly 
assumed any and every mental distinction to be also real. The fact is 
clearly seen to be that the scholastics were most keenly alive to the 
difference between the two orders, and that if they failed sometimes to 
apply their own terms successfully, the failure at least was 
due to ignorance about the nature of abstraction.<p>
(2) The second property of Being into which we  have to inquire is its 
Truth. Every <i>cognizable</i> Being cannot but be truly what it is: 
but we may still ask, Does every Being present such a relation to 
intellect as to be cognizable -- that is, to be a possible object of 
knowledge? or is there any genuine <b>alogon</b>, or surd, or
extra-intelligible Being? Can we give such 
<!--
110 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p110"></a>
an account of the truth in things as to meet the Hegelian difficulty, 
that if we suppose material things to exist in themselves, and to 
furnish the data of sensation, then "we must take what is given just as 
it is, and have no right to ask whether and to what extent it is 
rational in its own nature"? Now we do hold that material things exist 
in themselves, and that we first come across them through the data of 
sense; hence we have to meet the objection, How can such objects be 
rational in their own nature? We shall not, however, complicate the 
question by taking it up from the hands of Hegel, and trying to answer 
his requirements. As usual, he upsets all terminology,<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> identifying 
the thing with its notion, and saying that, while it may be 
<i>correct</i> to say that a man is sick or is thievish, this cannot be 
a <i>truth</i>, for truth is the conformity of an object with its idea, 
or with itself, and man ought not to be sick or thievish, for thereby 
he departs from his proper type. Of the negative side to the question 
which we are asking, Must all things have in them the attribute of 
truth for the intellect? we find a more plain-spoken exponent in Mr. J. 
Cotter Morison, who at the opening of his book on <i>The Service of 
Man</i>, puts the inquiry: "When the human race shall have ceased to 
exist, would it be right to say that the truths recognized by the human 
mind will survive it?" And he replies, "This could only be maintained 
by an idealist who should place their existence in some extra-mundane 
eternal mind -- which may be an

article of faith, but not of reason." He refers to a theory, like that 
of the late Mr. Green, that knowledge for men consists in an 
appropriation by them of the contents of an eternal consciousness which 
has all knowledge, and communicates it in measure to individuals; that 
reality consists in relations, and that intellect alone constitutes 
these relations. Green chimes in with our principles little more 
harmoniously than Hegel does; so we must leave the followers of these 
two to shift for themselves, while we take up Mr. Morison's question 
solely on our own responsibilities.<p>
(a) At the outset we have distinctly to repudiate the agnostic position 
in regard to the origin of our own minds and of the whole universe. 
Without a positive doctrine on this head we are utterly helpless before 
the inquiry, Must all things have about them the attribute of truth? 
Hence we start with the assumptions, which are no mere assumptions, but 
conclusions established in the treatise on Natural Theology, that there 
is one, primal, infinite Being, the intelligent Creator of finite 
Beings, who works with a perfect understanding of all He does. His own 
Being is to Him perfectly intelligible, and, according to exemplars 
which it suggests to His mind, He sees all other realizable essences or 
Beings. It follows at once that nothing can be literally chaotic and 
out of all relation to mind. Hence every being is true, which was the 
proposition be proved. It is the simplest deduction from our to 
premisses. St. Augustine, then, is right in his remark that "the true 
is that which <i>is</i>," and the 
<!--
112 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p112"></a>
delicate Orientalism which does duty for our rude phrase, "to tell a 
lie," has a sound philosophical basis: the liar "says the thing which 
is not." For whatever is, is true, and a lie asserts what is not, even 
when its falsehood consists in denying a fact. There is, however, an 
obvious difference between a false assertion and a false negation; yet 
this is a vanishing difference, when we choose to take advantage of our 
liberty to reduce all propositions alike to the form of an assertion. 
Thus he whose assertion is false, directly "says the thing which is 
not:" he whose negation is false indirectly "says the thing which is 
not." To explain the latter point, those who dislike to have recourse 
to the logical artifice, whereby a negation is sometimes changed, as to 
shape, into the affirmation of a negative predicate, may fall back upon 
another doctrine on which logicians dwell. They tell us how no negation 
stands simply as a negative: it is prompted by positive reasons, so 
that what we affirm is the ground of what we deny. Hence a false 
negation would be prompted by some implicit or explicit false 
affirmation. So even in negations falsehood consists in "saying the 
thing which is not:" and it can never be logically untrue to say the 
thing which is, for whatever is, is true.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> However, this is not part 
of our essential argument, but a remark by the way.  
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 113  
--><A NAME="p113"></a><p>
A few words from St. Thomas will emphasize our proof that every Being 
is true, though indeed there is little left to prove, after we have 
started with the supposition that the infinitely intelligent God is the 
Author of all things, possible and actual, "Because," writes the holy 
Doctor,<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> "all things are naturally referred to the standard of the 
Divine intellect, as works of art are referred to the laws of 
production in that art; it follows that everything is to be denominated 
true according as it has its proper form, which is the copy of the idea 
in the mind of the Great Artificer." Therefore, as God fails in none of 
His own immediate works, all things, inasmuch as they come from Him, 
are true; and, as we shall be imperatively called upon to explain later 
(under the heading c), even deformities in nature are still true. A 
little higher up in the same passage St. Thomas had remarked that all 
things, so far as they themselves are concerned, are at least 
potentially true in reference to our intellect also; not as to the 
master-mind which gives the rule of its own productions, but as to the 
observer's mind, upon which objects are apt to produce a true 
impression of themselves.<p>
By way of contrast with the command which our Theistic position gives 
us in arguments like the above, we may note how ridiculous it would be 
for Mill, on his system, to pronounce every Being true: nor does he 
fall into the absurdity. There is for him no known type of intellect 
which is universal: 
<!--
114 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p114"></a>
there is no necessary, eternal truth: every part of our knowledge is 
as relative as our mere sensations, so that just as it would be 
preposterous to say, Every object must be perceptible to one of our 
senses, in like manner it is preposterous to say, Every object must 
present an intelligible aspect. We, on the contrary, deriving all the 
ultimate possibilities and natures of things from an eminently 
intelligent and intelligible source, feel secure in our assertion that 
every Being must have its truth as Being, or its ontological truth. It 
cannot consist of contradictory constituents: it must truly be the 
sort of thing which it is, and therefore it presents a rational object 
of thought. This we can safely maintain on condition that we have got a 
correct theory about the nature of thought itself; but those who follow 
Hume's principles in relation to the understanding of man, are 
hopelessly shut out from all science of Ontology. Unwarrantably enough, 
Hume himself equivalently teaches that all Being is true; for he 
regards it as a test of the intrinsic possibility of a thing, that it 
should involve no self-contradiction. But what is the absence of
self-contradiction in a positive object, except the presence of some 
truly conceivable nature?<p>
Ontology, however, is content to stop short at the declaration that 
every Being is true, without attempting to describe how this truth 
makes itself manifest to us; for it belongs to Psychology to discuss 
the origin of ideas. Our proposition, therefore., does not commit us to 
various theories which different people may fancy necessary to the 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 115 
--><A NAME="p115"></a>
support of our view, because such would be their way of interpreting 
our utterance, if they had to defend its words. For example, we do not 
consider ourselves bound to animate all objects for the purpose of 
rendering them more apt to communicate a knowledge of themselves to us: 
nor do we consider ourselves bound to endow all objects with at least 
some sort of obscure intelligence, on Schelling's principle, that "what 
is destitute of understanding cannot be an object of understanding," 
that what has not got some share of logical truth, cannot have 
ontological truth?<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> We have not, in this treatise, to prove that 
there are mere material things, without a spark of intelligence in 
them; but we may be allowed to complete our proposition that every 
Being is true, by a brief statement of the principles from which we 
enter upon the present inquiry.<p>
Our view as to the identity and the difference between thought and 
thing is this: (i.) In God, who is the substantial thought, the two are 
identical, when it is His own Being which is the object of His 
knowledge: God is identically the infinite Object and the infinite 
Knowledge, and it is false to call Him the infinite Idea to the 
exclusion of His substantiality. When, however, God knows any  
<!--
116 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p116"></a>
created object, such object is not identical with His knowledge. (ii.) 
When man knows himself thought and thing are not identical, because 
man's knowledge is an act of the "accidental" order, and is not simply 
identified with his substance, least of all with his bodily substance: 
it is a real mode that comes and goes. (iii.) In an angel the case must 
be judged by doctrines, upon which we have not to enter. (iv.) When man 
knows an object as really distinct from himself, then such object is 
neither substantially nor accidentally identical with him, but is 
another thing. Here is our position against the idealism which would 
say that thought is the only reality: nothing is simply thought and no 
more, while some things are quite devoid and even incapable of thought.<p>
(b) When we teach that truth is a property of all Being we do not 
insinuate that truth is a reality over and above the reality of Being; 
rather it is Being itself in relation to intellect.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup>.  Every Being 
really presents an intelligible relation; so that while its truth is 
no superadded reality, it is real with the reality of Being. It is not 
a mere negation, though like other positive properties it may be 
described negatively, and is so described by Carleton, who places the 
truth of a thing in that whereby it is opposed to mere seeming or false 
appearances. "I like the view of Aureolus," he writes, "which is the 
opinion of 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS.  117
--><A NAME="p117"></a>
many others, that transcendental truth consists in the fact that Being 
gives us ground for denying the bare semblance of Being. For as Being 
is opposed to non-Being, so Being as true is opposed to Being as simply 
apparent." He allows, nevertheless, the tenability of the opinion 
upheld by Suarez and others, that the truth of Being is its 
<i>knowableness</i> -- "ut idem sit verum ac <i>ens cognoscibile</i>:" 
and this seems the more radical account of the matter. To define truth 
by its opposition to mere seeming, is better indeed than the device of 
Heraclitus, who describes truth as that which is not hidden, <b>to 
m&ecirc; l&ecirc;thon</b>; but truth, as a positive property of Being, 
is best explained to consist in the fact, that every Being must stand 
in the relation of a possible object for intellectual perception. Thus 
truth is Being as related to mind, a relation which no Being can be 
without.<p>
(c) To the Creative Mind every truth of Being must be actually and 
always known; but to the created mind the knowableness need not be more 
than potential, and need be even that only under an explanation. For if 
some objects, except in their highest generalities as things or 
substances, remained for ever beyond the power of knowledge 
communicated, as a fact, to creatures, no objection could be raised; 
but it would always remain possible that such objects should become, in 
some measure, intelligible to created faculties more highly endowed, 
whether naturally or supernaturally. Thus the knowledge would be beyond 
possibility to actual creatures, but not simply beyond all possibility 
of creatable Creatures.
<!--
118 BEING.  
--><A NAME="p118"></a><p>
The relation of ontological truth to finite mind is such that the 
former gives the rule to which the latter has to conform; the position 
is that of measure to measure-taker; and all that a creative genius 
among men can do is to dispose the given elements in conformity to the 
requirement of their own laws. <i>Obediendo imperat</i>: it is by 
submission that he rules. And even God Himself does not simply make 
truth by thinking it, and by thinking it as He likes: He too conforms, 
but His conformity is not a real subjection. For it means only that 
His intellect, as we mentally distinguish it from His essence, takes 
its rule from His essence, with which it is "really" identified, though 
"formally" it is not so: that is, His intellect, "formally" <i>qua</i> 
intellect, is not His essence, "formally" <i>qua</i> essence.<p>
Another difference in the relationship of the Divine and of the created 
intellect to the truth of things is observable in the fact, that the 
human artist may quite fail in executing what he has conceived, or 
may get puzzled over the very formation of the conception; whereas no 
such failure besets the action of the Almighty. If some of His works 
never attain their normal perfection, if in nature there are abortions 
and monstrosities and frustrated processes, all this follows from 
interference or want of co-operation between the several secondary 
agencies; all this the Creator fully foresaw and permitted, as regards 
every consequence actual and possible. So explained, nature's widest 
departure from right order is not a falsification of the Divine ideas. 
These ideas are, as they are called, <i>prototypic</i>,
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 119
--><A NAME="p119"></a>
and that character none of the miscarriages in the universe destroy. 
The very strife of things follows according to law, and might 
absolutely be deduced beforehand from the data. There is, however, 
something specially exceptional in free transgression of the moral law, 
whereby man departs from "true" conduct, in the sense in which 
Scripture calls all virtue truth and all sin a lie. Such departure from 
the type is not calculable from the physical data, it is no 
mathematical sequence; it is the nearest approach to an upsetting of 
our proposition in its universality, "All being is true," yet it does 
not succeed in the overthrow. The above statements are sufficient to 
meet the difficulties; but a refutation of these latter might be made 
by taking them higher up in the principles of Metaphysics. We are 
dealing with Being as Being, as <i>ens essentiae</i>, with Being also 
as it is one. Now Being so taken is always some one essence as such; 
and this cannot but be true to its own nature, and therefore to the 
Divine ideas. Whatever untruth comes in will be due to relationships 
between different Beings, even though these latter be only the 
different parts, constituting a compound Being. But any Being 
considered as an essence is necessary,<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> eternal, and immutable. It 
cannot suffer change of itself without ceasing to be that Being; hence 
it is of its own nature true, and we will add good also, For this is 
the attribute which we have next to consider, and the consideration of 
which will throw fuller light on what we have just said. It is 
convenient before we
<!--
120 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p120"></a>
begin the explanation of goodness to have had occasion to point out 
how, in assigning attributes to Being, we are primarily concerned, not 
specifically with the determinations of Being and their interrelations, 
but with Being in general as <i>ens essentiae</i>. Our inquiry has 
first taken this shape. Is Being, regarded as such, One and True? And 
having settled these two points in the affirmative, we have next to go 
on with the investigation, Is each one and true Being also good? can 
it, as Being, ever be pronounced bad? However, before plunging into the 
deep question about goodness, we will put an end to that about truth, 
by showing how to dispose of what may be estimated as one of the prime 
difficulties against our doctrine.<p>
(d) It is a fact which is ever being dinned into our ears, that the 
world in which we live is a deceitful world, a world of false 
appearances, and this even in the physical order.<p>
<blockquote>
The smoothest seas will oft-times prove<br> 
&nbsp; To the confiding bark untrue;<br> 
And if man trust the skies above,<br> 
&nbsp; They can be treacherous too.  
</blockquote><p>
But more than this -- and here is the point with which we wish to deal 
-- in the world of commerce, all is declared to be "shoddy," and 
"pinchbeck," and "Brummagem." Hence a mercantile man, whose life-long 
experiences of the tricks of trade have inclined him to regard the 
world as a large market for the sale of spurious articles under the 
guise of genuine, or at least for passing things off as other than what 
they exactly are, may quote his own
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 121
--><A NAME="p121"></a>
knowledge as dead against the proposition that "every Being is true." 
His mistake is simply about the meaning of the words: taken as they are 
intended by us, the words of our proposition merely assert the plain 
fact that everything is just what it is, not that everything is just 
what a vendor would have it thought to be, or tries to make it appear 
to be. The most adulterated or counterfeit article thus preserves its 
ontological truth; and so does even a lying utterance. For the liar 
thinks what he does think, and says what he does say, though he 
deliberately says other than he thinks. There is moral untruth, but not 
ontological.<p>
(3) (a) Goodness, as a property of Being, is apt extremely to puzzle 
the young student, because of the apparent trickishness of the notion. 
When he handles it for a length of time together, it is perpetually 
slipping through his fingers; and when he picks it up again it often 
seems to have changed its shape. But most perplexing of all is it when 
he comes across the doctrine that to regard goodness as a property of 
Being is to reverse the right order of concepts; that goodness is the 
most fundamental of all, and that upon it Being rests as a sort of 
attribute. About this theory it will be useful to say a few words, in 
the course of which it will be necessary to bear in mind, how easily, 
since Being, its Unity, its Truth, and its Goodness are all the same 
thing under different aspects, their relative positions can be altered 
by changing the point of view; and the chief question is whether some 
of these changes are not too violent to meet with our approval. 
<!--
122 BEING.  
--><A NAME="p122"></a><p>
As a variation upon the procedure of the Eleatics, who made fixed Being 
the only reality and denied the changeable to be real, Euclid and the 
Megaric school<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> put the good in place of Eleatic Being, and said 
that it was the one, constant, immutable element. "The Megarics," 
writes Cicero,<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> "affirmed that alone to be good which is one, and 
like, and always the same," <b>oion, homoion, tauton</b>. No exact 
system can be gathered from their teachings, and they are mentioned 
merely as instances of those who regarded good as the most radical 
notion. Plato<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> often tends towards the same doctrine in which he is 
followed by various Platonizers. St. Thomas thinks it worth his while 
to state and answer the difficulty which he finds in the fact, that the 
Pseudo-Dionysius<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> seems to place the Good, as a Divine name, before 
Being. Scotus Erigena, however, is one of the boldest assertors of the 
preeminence of <i>good</i> above <i>essence</i>: he says, "Not only 
those things which are, are good, but even those which are not, are 
called good. Nay, the things 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS 123 
--><A NAME="p123"></a>
which are not, are called much better than the things which are; for 
in so far as they transcend essence they approach to the superessential 
good," that is God, whom Erigena styles, <i>Nothing</i>; "but in so far 
as they participate of essence, they are separated from the 
superessential <i>Good</i>."<p>
If, however, we find the good in various ways put at the root of Being, 
the like, to some extent, is observable of the One and the True. 
Plotinus takes as his starting-point the One or the Good indifferently, 
but not Being (<b>to on</b>); and those whose tendency it is to regard 
thought as that which constitutes the order of things, will incline to 
make truth fundamental, and to reverse in some degree Plato's maxim 
that Being is the measure of thinking.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> Parmenides<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> identifies 
the thought and the thing; and in Kantian or Hegelian language, we are 
told<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> that "to say that the real world is the intelligible world, is 
to say that reality is something at which we arrive by a constructive 
process," that is, the mind in some way makes its own reality or truth.<p>
St. Thomas had dealt with the question whether we should regard Being 
as more fundamental than the good; and his reply is that<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> "in the 
order of reason, Being is prior to the good. For Being is the first 
object which the mind conceives, because 
<!--
124 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p124"></a>
it is precisely that according to which a thing is cognizable: 
everything is cognizable inasmuch as it is <i>in act</i>," inasmuch as 
it is not merely potential but actual. It is only from the actual that 
the potential can be known; never can it be known directly from itself. 
It will be observed that St. Thomas is speaking rather of <i>ens 
existentiae</i> than of <i>ens essentiae</i>; rather of Being the 
participle, than of Being the noun: whereas we, for the sake of clear 
consistency throughout our exposition, must speak of <i>ens 
essentiae</i> when we defend the truth of all Being. Nevertheless, we 
may adopt his language and make it our own. For, whether we speak of 
existence, or whether we speak of essence in its widest sense of a 
<i>somewhat</i> capable of receiving existence, in either case we can 
apply the maxim, which, referring to priority not of time but of 
nature, says, <i>Prius est esse quam esse tale</i> -- "To be at all is 
a more fundamental conception than to be this or that." On which 
principle Being is more fundamental than being good; or Being is the 
subject and goodness is its attribute. Of course the two are one 
identical reality; but in the order of mental distinction we have a 
valid reason for choosing to regard the mental relation of one to the 
other in the light under which we have considered the case. At the same 
time we do not deny to others the possibility of taking the two words, 
Being and Goodness, as practically synonymous, and even of using the 
expression that a certain amount of goodness or perfection is what is 
necessary to constitute a Being, or is a condition of Being. At the 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 125 
--><A NAME="p125"></a>
same time we claim for ourselves the right to rest satisfied with the 
order given by St. Thomas.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> "The intellect first apprehends Being 
itself; next, it apprehends its own knowledge of Being; and thirdly, 
its own appetition<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> of Being; therefore the succession of ideas is, 
Being, Truth, Goodness. It will be observed that oneness, which is 
estimated or a different ground, is omitted in the enumeration. After 
these few remarks on a frequently raised question of priority, we must 
now inquire how and why every Being is good.<p>
(b) By a sort of cross-division we might take the intellect as 
understanding the act of volition, and the will as willing the act of 
intellect. Thus truth would be referred not only to intellect, but also 
to will, and goodness would be referred not only to will, but also to 
intellect. But it is here found convenient that we should keep to one 
reference at a time; on which supposition Being, in relation to 
intellect, has just been shown to be true, and we have next to prove 
that Being in relation to appetite or will is good. Plato, in the Sixth 
Book of his <i>Republic</i>, says that "the good is the object which 
all pursue, and for the sake of which always they act;" in 
correspondence with which words, Aristotle, towards the beginning of 
his <i>Ethics</i>, describes the good as the object of all 
appetite.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> No small confusion is introduced  
<!--
126 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p126"></a>
into the subject, because of the variety of aspects under which we can 
regard the good as appetible, and because of the great tendency to 
slide inadvertently from one point of view to another. It is well, 
therefore, that we should, at the outset, explicitly direct our 
attention to four conceivable aspects. Each Being taken in itself, 
according to its own nature as an <i>ens essentiae</i>, has a certain 
degree of perfection which constitutes its intrinsic goodness. Now (1) 
if this Being is intelligent, it can appreciate its own goodness, and 
make it the term of an act of approval by the will; if, however, the 
Being is non-intelligent (2) we can regard its goodness as becoming an 
object of disinterested approval in the will of an intelligent 
contemplator, who wishes the thing to have the perfection which it 
possesses; or (3) by endowing the thing with a sort of metaphorical 
will, we can imagine it as pleased with its own degree of perfection. 
Hitherto we have been taking the thing always as <i>bonum sibi</i>, 
good in its own regard; we can further take it (4) as <i>bonum 
alteri</i>, good in regard to something really other than itself. These 
are four aspects which are often usefully distinguished.<p>
Occasionally, another principle of distinction proves convenient. Every 
good is <i>bonum alteri</i>, good to another: but this otherness may be 
merely logical, and then it corresponds to the <i>bonum sibi</i> of the 
first division; or it may be <i>bonum alteri</i>, in the sense of real 
otherness. We might stop short here: but a few subdivisions of the 
second member which are easily intelligible, will add clearness to 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS 127 
--><A NAME="p127"></a>
future details. The real otherness is greatest when we have two 
distinct substances, one helpful to the other: it is not so great when 
one substantial part of the same body helps another, or helps the whole 
body: it is least when it is only an accidental quality or disposition 
which perfects the substance to which it belongs. Bread is good for 
man; his own eyes are good for man; the movements gone through in 
exercise are good for man: these examples illustrate the successive 
degrees. With the above distinctions to guide our thoughts, as to the 
possible terms of reference towards which a thing may be said to be 
good, we may proceed to establish our proposition, which is, that every 
Being is good.<p>
So much Being as each thing has, so much perfection <i>caeteris 
paribus</i> must it have; and this perfection is good in itself.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> 
Here is a more infallible rule than Falstaff's, "The more flesh, the 
more frailty." Therefore, if presently we can make ourselves secure 
about that <i>caeteris paribus</i>, as we shall be able to do in the 
explanations which follow, every Being is proved to be <i>bonum 
sibi</i>, or good as taken absolutely in itself: and it may be viewed 
in any of the three aspects mentioned in the first of our two tables of 
division.<p>
Furthermore, there is no Being that cannot discharge some good office 
in regard to something  
<!--
128 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p128"></a>
else: which shows that every Being is likewise <i>bonum alteri</i>, 
good as taken relatively to another -- to something which is really, 
and not only logically another. As Hooker puts it, "All things, God 
alone excepted, besides the nature which they have in themselves, 
receive some perfection from other things." It is not affirmed that 
everything is good in regard to everything else, or good in every 
respect even to anything else; it is maintained only that every Being 
has some use in regard to something else, as when rubbish serves our 
purpose of filling up a hole, or pain warns a man off from what would 
prove utter destruction to his life. A new manufacture occasionally 
gives a market-value to what before was unsaleable. If, therefore, we 
illustrate our proposition from the region of matter alone, we can 
put the case compendiously, by reference to what is given in last 
chemical analysis. There we find matter ultimately made up of certain 
elements which we cannot alter; each of these has a definite nature of 
its own, that is, a certain perfection or goodness in itself; each, 
moreover, is capable of entering into relation with some others for an 
end which is good. What combinations are good and what not, must be 
judged by the purposes which are helped or hindered in the several 
instances; and what is bad under one aspect, will generally be found 
good under another. Yet this does not put even relative good and bad on 
a par, and making it as philosophical to say, "Every Being is bad," as 
to say, "Every Being is good." No doubt any finite Being may enter 
into relations which are bad for
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH AND GOODNESS. 129
--><A NAME="p129"></a>
itself or for another: nevertheless, badness is never Being as such, 
nor the mere natural tendency of Being as such.<p>
We have been using perfection as synonymous with Being, and the right 
so to do needs a word of explanation. The perfect is, etymologically, 
that which is fully made, or is a thorough piece of work; in this sense 
it cannot apply to God. But when the perfect is described as, "that 
which wants nothing of all that is proper to its nature," then God also 
may be called perfect. Being is perfection because it is either a 
complete nature, or something which contributes towards the completion 
or the adornment of some nature.<p>
The doctrine that every Being is good sounds very odd to some, who 
fancy that there must be jugglery in the words, and that, perhaps, 
"good for nothing," or "good for doing mischief," is included under 
good; therefore we will rehearse the whole teaching in the 
authoritative language of St. Thomas. He lays it down that as truth is 
what intellect tends to, so goodness is what the will or appetite tends 
to; yet with this difference, that whereas the true is so denominated 
primarily from the intellect, the good is so denominated primarily from 
the thing.<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup>  Each of the two properties, however, is adequately 
denominated only by refer. ence to both faculty and object. As regards 
the faculty of appetition, he distinguishes the appetite roused and 
guided by knowledge (<i>appetitus elicitus</i>) from the appetite in a 
lower sense (<i>appetitus 
<!--
130 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p130"></a>
naturalis</i>), namely, the tendency<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> of everything towards that 
which is suitable to its nature. Under this wide sense of "appetite" he 
defines the Good, in most general terms, as that which gives 
perfection, either complete or partial, to a thing, and so is 
<i>appetible</i>. "<i>Good</i> has for its meaning <i>perfection</i>, 
and the perfect is the object of appetite."<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> Rather, however, than 
say with some modern evolutionists, that a thing is good because it is 
appetible, St. Thomas would say that a thing is appetible because it is 
good -- a principle which would allow for acquired appetites, and the 
effects of custom. For each Being has a perfection suitable to its own 
nature, towards which perfection certain other things are of themselves 
conducive; this perfection and this conduciveness form their goodness, 
and on their goodness follows their appetibility.<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> Thus of the two 
definitions, <i>Bonum est quod alicui convenit</i> -- "Good is what is 
suitable to some Being," and <i>Bonum est quod alicui appetibile 
est</i> -- "Good is what is appetible by some Being," the latter is 
best regarded as consequent on the former, and not the other way about. 
When, however, it is said <i>alicui bonum, alicui appetibile</i>, the 
"otherness" which is required between that which is good and that to 
which it is good, need not always amount to a real distinction; a 
mental or logical distinction will suffice. Because there always is 
some otherness real or logical, goodness is to that extent always 
relative: but as the logical otherness 
<!--
UNITY TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 131 
--><A NAME="p131"></a>
is not real, the goodness with which it is concerned may be called 
<i>absolute (bonum sibi</i>), by comparison with the other kind of 
goodness (<i>bonum alteri</i>), which is therefore termed especially 
<i>relative</i>. Of course in its fullest sense <i>absolute 
goodness</i> means goodness without alloy or limit -- infinite 
goodness, just as absolute perfection means infinite perfection; still 
finite natures have each their absolute goodness and perfection, so far 
as they have all that properly belongs to them. The only difficulty is 
that often we cannot precisely fix what a "nature" is; but that 
difficulty belongs to some special science, not to General Metaphysics. 
In the case of absolute goodness, then, according to our present use of 
the phrase, a thing has, or may be imagined to have, a sort of 
complacency in that which it is; for, says St. Thomas, "everything 
already in possession of Being, naturally likes that Being, and 
preserves it to the best of its power."<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup> Contrasted with this good 
of rest in an end attained (<i>in fine quiescere</i>), is the other 
good which is tended to as an end yet to be attained (<i>tendere in 
finem</i>).<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> Or good may be divided into the good which a thing has, 
the good which it wants to acquire for itself, and the good which it 
seeks to diffuse to others. If in the case of material things this 
wanting, or seeking, or appetite is only figurative, St. Thomas 
justifies the metaphor by usage, quoting Boethius, who says: 
"Providence has given to created things this chief principle ot 
permanence, that, as far as they can, they have a <i>natural desire</i> 
to persist in Being; wherefore you can 
<!--
132 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p132"></a>
in no way doubt <i>that all things whatsoever have a natural 
tendency</i> to seek their own continuance and to avoid 
destruction."<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> We may add the words of a yet higher authority, St. 
Paul:<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup> "The expectation of the creature waiteth for the revelation 
of the sons of God; for the creature was made subject to vanity, not 
wittingly, but by reason of Him that made it subject in hope. But the 
creature also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of 
corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God. For we 
know that <i>every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain</i> till 
now." In the broad sense, then, of the words <i>desire</i> and 
<i>appetite</i>, every Being, according to St. Thomas, seeks after 
good: every Being is good, and actively tends to good, for every Being 
in itself, and every activity in itself, constitute or effect some 
perfection -- some nature or some energy which as such cannot but be 
good. Thus Manichaeism as a theory is quite excluded.<p>
The security of the whole doctrine, as expounded on our own chosen 
plan, consists in resting it upon Being as <i>Ens Essenticae</i>; no 
<i>Ens Essentiae</i>, whether substantial or accidental, can be 
otherwise than good as an <i>Ens Essentiae</i>. St. Thomas puts the 
point thus,<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup> "Every essence is natural to some thing or other. 
Because, if it is in the order of substances, then it is the very 
nature itself; if it is in the order of accidents, it must follow from 
some substantial principle, and so be natural to its own substance, 
even though to another substance it
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS 133 
--><A NAME="p133"></a>
may not be naturally adapted. Whereas something evil in itself could 
be natural to nothing; for it is the character of evil to be the 
privation of something native to an object, or due to it; but the 
privation of what is natural to an object, cannot be natural to 
anything. Hence what is natural to a thing is its good if it is 
present, its evil if it is absent. Thus no essence is in itself bad."<p>
(c) The doctrine that every Being is good is not the same as the false 
doctrine, sometimes conveyed by writers like Walt Whitman, that every 
Being is equally good; nor with the other false doctrine that there is 
no real evil in the world. It is only a pseudo-philosophy which can 
pretend to be so reverential for facts as to consider every fact 
equally sacred, and to pronounce a life primarily devoted to 
discovering facts about the structure of one tiny insect well spent, 
indeed better spent, than a life primarily devoted to the study of 
theology, where facts are less manifest to the senses. On this theory, 
a man who was so busy with his microscope that he had no time even to 
inquire about religion, would be put down as deserving a happy 
futurity, if unexpectedly he should find himself existing after death 
and confronted with God as his Judge. Our doctrine, while it pronounces 
every Being good with a perfection of its own, recognizes different 
degrees of perfection according to the rank of the several Beings 
which make up a gradationa] or hierarchical universe. Next and more 
important still is our assertion, that not only are some Beings less 
<!--
134 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p134"></a>
perfect than others, but that there is real evil to be met with in the 
world. The equal mind with which some artists, who call themselves 
"realists," profess to view all things, is bad enough in art; it is 
worse as an explicit philosophy. Of art we are told,<p>
<blockquote>
With equal feet she treads an equal path,<br> 
Nor recks the goings of the sons of men;<br> 
She hath for sin no scorn, for wrong no wrath,<br> 
No praise for virtue and no tears for pain.  
</blockquote><p>
Asserting that good and evil are two contraries and that both are to be 
found side by side, what we have yet to explain is that which the 
schoolmen call the precise <i>formality</i> of evil -- namely, the 
character wherein exactly its badness consists. The said schoolmen have 
entered minutely into the question, investigating not merely bad 
things, but the precise reason why things are bad.<p>
We may begin by taking it as clear that there cannot be a thing wholly 
evil, but that there is always "some soul of goodness in things evil;" 
the more correct expression for which would be, "some badness in things 
good." For as the axiom has it, <i>malum est in bono subjecto</i>, every 
instance of evil must be found in a subject which of its own nature is 
good. Bacon's saying that "Being without well-being is a curse," cannot 
be taken to mean that well-Being is a real addition to Being, without 
which it would have no desirableness. As we have already shown, Being 
as Being must be good: so that it is not the good that is the character 
to be accounted for with difficulty, but the evil. How into good Being 
can evil be introduced? and what is it when intro<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 135 
--><A NAME="p135"></a>duced? The scholastics reply not that the whole evil thing, but 
that just precisely its badness -- the <i>malitia</i> which is in the 
<i>malum</i> and constitutes it malum -- is never a positive entity, 
but always some privation of positive entity <i>in subjecto bono</i>, 
that is, in an entity which, as such, is good. Our task then is to 
show, that badness can in every instance be regarded as a "privation," 
which is defined to be "the absence of a perfection which is by nature 
due to some subject." Not to see is in man a privation, and is called 
blindness; not to see in a stone is a mere negation, and is not 
properly called blindness.<p>
As we divided <i>good</i> into absolute and relative, so we will apply 
the same division, as far as the nature of the case will allow, to 
<i>bad</i>. Thus we get the following heads: (1) A simple substance 
admits of no absolute evil in itself as a substance; for it is a 
definite nature, good in itself, which simply either exists or does not 
exist; and the only evil it can allow of would be in its accidents, as, 
for example, when an angel puts forth a perverse act of will, sins, and 
is afflicted with punishment. (2) A compound substance, because it is 
made up of parts, is more liable to evil. For if we take these parts 
according to the rough division of distinguishable members, it is clear 
that a limb may be missing, or out of its proper position, or distorted 
in shape. But if we go deeper into the question, then on the scholastic 
theory of matter and form even in compound substances, no evil can be 
rigorously substantial; for the schoolmen regard every com<!--
136 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p136"></a>pound substance as due to a single indivisible form, which gives 
determination to matter otherwise quite indeterminate. According to 
this supposition the evil would not be in the essential substance: it 
could only affect the accidental parts. If, however, we may take a 
rougher estimate of compound substances, we can say that in it 
<i>relativo-absolute</i> badness is possible.  We call it
relativo-absolute not for any recondite reason, but simply because it 
is relative inasmuch as it is due to the bad relationships of parts, 
which are ill-arranged, or misshapen, or have some of their number 
wanting, while it is absolute inasmuch as it affects the thing regarded 
in itself, and not merely in reference to other things. In the last 
place (3) there is evidently relative badness between thing and thing, 
inasmuch as one destroys the perfection of another. Thus on a complete 
survey it will appear the evil always arises from some relation, either 
between the accidents of a substance and their subject, or between 
substantial parts within the same subject, or between different 
subjects. Therefore the question now takes the shape, how can evil 
arise out of the relations of Beings? If each Being, as such, is good, 
if all the accidents and activities of Being in themselves are good, 
how from these elements can evil originate? How can we have in the 
consequent what is not given in the several antecedents?<p>
We must fall back upon first principles. God is the very Being, 
<i>ipsissimum ens</i>, which implies the exclusion of all imperfection. 
Therefore Being in itself, and in its plenitude, is nothing but 
perfection, 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 137 
--><A NAME="p137"></a>
Creatures, however, as the Fathers of the Church sometimes put it, are 
made up of Being and not-Being -- an expression which may be much 
misapprehended. It would be a gross blunder to regard this not-Being as 
a positive component; it stands for the limitations of Being. If we may 
borrow an illustration from another treatise, it is there shown that 
error never comes of intelligence as such: there is no intelligence 
which is strictly erroneous, and the intelligence of error can mean 
only the detection of error, which is a knowledge of truth. Error, 
however, though not springing from intellect, is rendered radically 
possible by the limitations of intellect. What is impossible to 
infinite knowledge is possible to finite understanding. Similarly, evil 
has its root, not in Being, but in the limitations of Being. Error and 
evil are not mere limitations, but they supervene upon limitations. 
What supervenes in the case of evil is a relative unsuitableness 
between two or more objects that are brought into some sort of 
connexion, which they are incapable of forming without detriment to one 
or all of the members.<p>
An example will best show how evil so brought about can be reduced to 
the idea of a privation, however positive it may at first sight seem in 
itself. To be fair, we will not choose an instance of the more negative 
order, but distinctly of the positive kind, so far as that can be. Some 
disease germs appear to take no hold on the human body, unless there 
is what physicians call the appropriate morbid diathesis, or the 
appropriate <i>nidus</i>; in which case 
<!--
138 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p138"></a>
we should already have evil existing before the precise point of time 
at which we want to suppose it being produced; for there would be a bad 
predisposition. But there are poisons that will destroy the healthiest 
frames, and we might take their action for an illustration; it will, 
however, be more convenient if we imagine some fungoid growth, which 
could be started at pleasure on the surface of any human body. Upon the 
healthy flesh, then, the foreign growth is supposed to be introduced, 
and begins to feed on its substance. It is common to call such fungoid 
matter itself the disease or the evil; but strictly this is not so, for 
it is rather the cause of the evil which is in the man, not in it; it 
thrives and is well, the man wastes away and is ill; it, so to speak, 
triumphs, and man is defeated. The evil, then, is in man, and is 
reducible to a privation in that he has not the flesh which he ought to 
have, or the nutriment for it which he ought to have, or the 
composition and disposition of its parts which he ought to have; for an 
alien organism has robbed him of his natural due. Similarly, cancer 
eats away the human flesh; it is itself healthy, prosperous and 
figuratively happy, while man is diseased, unprosperous, and literally 
unhappy, because of an evil which consists in a privation of proper 
structure in the part affected. But, it is urged, suppose we introduce 
into the human system not a germ that thrives on man's substance, but 
some mineral matter that simply obstructs the way. If a child swallows 
a plaything that sticks in the throat, stops the breathing, and 
produces death, how is there
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 139
--><A NAME="p139"></a>
privation in this case? Again, the evil is not in the plaything: at 
least, we may suppose that to be neither better nor worse in itself, 
for its novel situation; but the evil is that the lungs suffer. 
privation of fresh air, the blood, deprived of its proper constituents, 
fails to do its proper work, and so privation upon privation succeeds, 
till the child is deprived of the vital conditions and dies. The mere 
positive presence of the obstruction would not kill; the mere positive 
presence of carbon in the blood would not kill, unless something 
positive were taken away which was necessary for life. Some foreign 
substances are lodged in man's body, but because they stop no vital 
function which ought to go on, they do not produce evil. No man dies of 
a simple addition to his body, which effects no subtraction. Whence it 
appears that the agent from which evil proceeds may be, and even must 
be, positive; its effect may be, and even must be, positive, so far as 
no positive activity can result in simple nothingness or annihilation; 
nevertheless, the badness, <i>ipsa malitia</i>, is never the positive 
Being as such, but some privation of Being. The evil in the bullet-wound 
is neither the mass of lead, nor the blood that soaks the earth, nor 
the flesh which is torn, nor the veins which are opened; all these, so 
far as they are positive entities, are good; the evil in them is 
reducible to privations of several kinds -- privations of all those 
conditions which ought to be there and are not. If this doctrine should 
still be doubtful to the reader because he has difficulty in distinctly 
tracing evil to its form of a priva<!--
140 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p140"></a>tion, he may satisfy himself indirectly in this way. He can 
convince himself of the propositions, that all Being as such is good; 
that spilt blood, lacerated flesh, flesh putrified and dissolved into 
less complex compounds, have, as entities, their own perfection; next, 
he can convince himself that evil is not a mere negation; and lastly, 
he can draw the conclusion that badness in itself, since it is neither 
entity as such, nor non-entity as such, must be something intermediate, 
namely, a privation. Here is a doctrine which might seem a useless 
refinement; but in the days of the Manichean controversy, it proved 
very serviceable in the hands of the Fathers, who had to show that no 
original Principle of Evil need be postulated as coeval with the 
Principle of Good, in order to account for what is bad in the world.<p>
Suarez developes the argument in the eleventh disputation of his 
<i>Metaphysics</i>. He fully admits that<sup><small><a name="n35"><a href="#n_35">{35}</a></a></small></sup> "a positive form can be in 
disagreement with a subject, and to be in disagreement with another is 
the same thing as to be evil. As, therefore, the good, in the sense of 
what agrees with another, means no more than the perfection of one 
thing, along with the implied signification of something else, such 
that the said perfection is suitable or due to it; so the bad which is 
the opposite of the good, has for its precise meaning nothing else than 
the perfection of one thing, along with the implied signification of 
something else, such that the said perfection is in disagreement with 
it, or is repugnant
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 141
--><A NAME="p141"></a>
to it." In these words the author makes ample provision for all that is 
positive in evil; evil is in a positive and good subject; it comes from 
an agent positive and good; yet its precise badness, <i>ipsa malitia qua 
talis</i>, is a privation. "The unsuitableness itself belongs to the 
category of privation; it lies in the unfitness for suitable union or 
composition"<sup><small><a name="n36"><a href="#n_36">{36}</a></a></small></sup> between the form which is positive and good in itself, 
and the subject which is positive and good in itself. These expressions 
must not be pushed too far. The evil of a parasitic disease is not 
simply that a morbid growth is under privation of the power to maintain 
itself without injuring man, while man is under privation of the power 
to feed it without loss to his own integrity. These two inabilities are 
not privations, if the two growths are considered as possible apart; 
for it is then not due to either that it should be able to accommodate 
the other. What now lives as a parasite, perhaps, can also maintain a 
non-parasitic life: in which case the two lives are compatible. Their 
mutual unsuitableness does not become an evil till a combination takes 
place which is detrimental to at least one side. Here begins the 
badness; for however good man may be to his destroying parasite, it is 
bad to him. The evil is neither a positive Being nor a positive 
activity of Being as such; it is the privation of some perfection, the 
absence of a good that is needful. What the parasite takes from man 
leaves him in the evil plight. "The evil," says St. Thomas,<sup><small><a name="n37"><a href="#n_37">{37}</a></a></small></sup> "which 
attaches to some good, is the privation of 
<!--
142 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p142"></a>
some further good;" "evil is the deficiency of some good which ought 
to be present."<sup><small><a name="n38"><a href="#n_38">{38}</a></a></small></sup><p>
It is likely to have struck the reader, that when evil is said to arise 
as a result from the unsuitableness there is between two finite beings 
as regards the union of their several perfections, -- for example, from 
such an incompatibility as there is between the successful propagation 
of a disease germ and the successful functioning of the system at whose 
expense it feeds, -- the difficulty is to fix on a standard of good. 
Clearly if the disease germ kills the man we call that evil; if the 
human system proves too strong for the germ and kills it, we call that 
good: because we can give a decided preference here to the human 
organism. But in the struggle for existence between life and life in 
the mere animal or vegetable order, or between compound and compound in 
the mineral order, frequently we have no absolute standard. In these 
cases we either give no preference, or else we give it on the 
understanding that it is relative to present purposes, and may be 
reversed under other requirements. In general we make our standard the 
adaptability to ordinary human uses. On this criterion water in the 
liquid state is often pronounced good; in the frozen condition, evil. 
Likewise we may at times have regard to the universe as a whole, or 
to our planet in particular, or to the interests of our nation above 
other. nations. In living beings there is a healthy standard which is 
scarcely to be found in chemical combinations,
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS 143 
--><A NAME="p143"></a>
among which the chemist comes to have a wonderful impartiality, being 
as interested in a process of decomposition as of composition or of 
preservation. Thus it appears that we must allow for the relativity of 
good, without allowing that good is a purely relative term; for we can 
fix some points of absolute worth.<p>
The conclusion is that we are neither pessimists nor optimists; that we 
admit evil, but not any essentially evil principle: that we maintain 
every Being as such, and every activity of Being as such, to be good, 
yet so that out of the interrelations of finite perfections evil may 
ensue for want of the power of mutual accommodation. When evil does 
thus result the badness itself is neither a positive Being, nor a 
positive activity of Being; it is the privation of some perfection, the 
absence of a good that is needful. Moral evil because of the peculiar 
nature of free-will, which does not act simply with the mathematical 
necessity of its nature, presents special difficulties in the way of 
the reduction of evil to a privation; but to these we have paid no 
special attention because they belong to another treatise.<sup><small><a name="n39"><a href="#n_39">{39}</a></a></small></sup> We are 
content to point out that there is a distinction between the physical 
evil which results  
<!--
144 BEING.
--><A NAME="p144"></a>
from intrinsically and separately good agencies, working according to 
the rigorous necessities of their nature, and that evil which is not 
chargeable apon nature, but upon the responsibility of the individual 
who may use or abuse his powers at will.<p>
There is, however, one evil which is found both in the sensible and in 
the rational order, and which seems to present peculiar obstacles when 
we try to show that it is privation; which, moreover, we cannot fairly 
transmit for consideration to another treatise. Pain seems to be a 
positive evil; for it is not reducible to the absence of pleasure, nor, 
on the theory that some painful positions bring pleasure along with 
them, because of the sympathy received or because of an exalted state 
of feeling, can we argue that pain is only pleasure in disguise. We 
can, however, urge as a preliminary point that pain has its decided 
uses, so decided that a cautious man would think twice before he voted, 
supposing the case was put to the plebiscite, that pain should be 
utterly abolished from the universe. Pain is a most useful monitor 
against the approach of disease and death to the body; it is the only 
check which we have on the deeds of some of the criminal classes; it 
offers occasion for the highest human virtues. Still it is a sign, that 
however wonderful be the perfection displayed in that most wonderful of 
things, consciousness, the created consciousness is what theologians 
called a mixed perfection -- that is, a kind of perfection which 
involves an element of imperfection. Finite objects have always this 
draw<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 145 
--><A NAME="p145"></a>back, that the consequence of the limitations in their nature is at 
least a liability to evil. Created consciousness, while it is the very 
condition for being able to enjoy pleasure, has the defect that it is 
also the very condition for possible pain.<p>
Pain is, first of all, in the sensitive faculties. Here we should have 
no difficulty in showing that so far as concerns the material 
conditions, the evil in the nervous system is a privation of some 
connatural state. There remains still the feeling of pain in sensation, 
which feeling is bad; and this we will recur to when we have brought 
down pain in the intellectual order to a similar residuum. Pain in this 
latter order is difficult to analyze. We cannot, to begin with, assign 
a deranged condition of parts to the soul, answering to what we said 
about the derangement of the nervous organism. On the other hand, what 
we know of the punishment of lost angels, and of lost souls of men in 
the disembodied condition, suggests the idea of a pain in the very 
substance of the soul. Again it might be asked whether, when the body 
is in pain, a sympathetic condition of pain is not taken up in the 
substance of the soul. Whatever other answer may be given to these 
difficulties, at any rate pain, as pain, must always be a conscious 
state, and consciousness in creatures, the only beings capable of pain, 
is not a substance, but the accident of a faculty, whatever may be the 
precise distinction of that faculty from its substance, whether real or 
only mental. Now pain as found in consciousness will be, under one 
aspect, the perception of some evil either 
<!--
146 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p146"></a>
moral or simply physical. Moral evil we have already passed over; and 
physical evil, as perceived by the intelligence to exist between 
objects, could be reduced to privation. There stands over, 
nevertheless, the pain of <i>feeling. Painful feeling</i>, then, 
whether in the sensitive or in the intellectual sphere, is the evil 
that has yet to be reconciled with our proposition, "Every Being is 
good."<p>
We will not ground the reconciliation on the doctrine that Being and 
consciousness are the two great opposites; and that therefore positive 
evil in consciousness is no proof of positive evil in Being. At the 
same time it is fair to appeal to a parallel case. Against the thesis, 
"Every Being is true," it is no exception that there are such things as 
positively erroneous judgments; for the error in such judgments is 
logical, not ontological, while our thesis is concerned with truth as 
ontological. Moreover, the positive error is not a positive perception, 
for it results from an act of the intellect, which passes beyond 
strictly intellectual procedure. To return, however, to pain as in 
consciousness; this is in some way an entity. But what kind of an 
entity? Psychologists have great difficulty in determining what that 
<i>feeling</i> is, that <i>sense of pleasure and pain</i>, that 
<i>emotion</i>, which is found in the exercise of thought and will. It 
seems extravagant to teach that such <i>feeling</i> has as much right 
to be distinguished from thought and will, as these two have to be 
distinguished from each other; the more moderate doctrine seems to be, 
that precisely because thought and 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 147 
--><A NAME="p147"></a>
will are conscious acts, they will carry with them the character of 
pain or pleasure, though sometimes these characters may be reduced, if 
not absolutely, at least equivalently to nothing. Feeling is thus a 
character of conscious action. Painful feeling in a certain sense, has 
a positive opposition to pleasant, for it is its contrary, and not its 
mere contradictory. Are we, then, to be distressed that we cannot, in 
pain, discover the privation of some element, such that in this 
privation the very <i>formality</i> of its evil consists? We think not. 
We found that in assigning privations we always reduced evil to a 
defective composition of elements either of substantial or accidental 
elements, or of both together. Now pain <i>considered simply as a 
feeling</i> does not allow of analysis into parts. We may analyze the 
objects or motives which cause pain: we may in them discover the 
privations that are evil. We may likewise distinguish one pain as 
different in quantity or quality from another. But within a single 
painful feeling, <i>regarded as a feeling</i>, we cannot distinguish an 
element which is present, and another element, the absence of which is 
a privation. The conclusion is that the evil of pain offers no valid 
objection to our general doctrine, for we see clear reason why our 
ordinary analysis in the case proposed cannot be fully completed.<p>
(d) Being in its reference to the intellect has been shown to he true; 
in its reference to the will it has been shown to be good, and if we 
had what some assert, a distinct faculty for the perception of the 
beautiful Being in reference to that 
<!--
148 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p148"></a>
would give us the beautiful. But we have no such special faculty, so 
we must manage to find the beauty of Being in its reference either to 
intellect, or to will, or to both. Thus we shall identify the beautiful 
with the good, or the true, or both. Identifying it with the good, St. 
Thomas refers the latter in this case, not as before, to an appetite 
for the possession of it, but to the intelligence of it; he makes the 
beautiful to be the good as affording contemplative delight, apart from 
the desire to possess.<sup><small><a name="n40"><a href="#n_40">{40}</a></a></small></sup> "The beautiful," he says, "is the same thing 
as the good, from which it is only mentally distinguished. For as the 
good is the object of all appetite (<i>quod omnia appetunt</i>), its 
nature is to give rest to the appetite. But the special nature of the 
beautiful is, that by its mere contemplation the appetite is set at 
rest; hence those senses which belong most to the cognitive order are 
most apt to perceive the beautiful, namely, the eyes and the ears which 
especially minister to the reason; for we speak of beautiful sights and 
sounds, but not of beautiful tastes and odours. Whence it appears that 
the beautiful adds to the notion of the good a peculiar relation to the 
cognitive powers; and while the good is that object which simply 
gratifies the appetite, the beautiful is that which gratifies by its 
mere apprehension." In another place<sup><small><a name="n41"><a href="#n_41">{41}</a></a></small></sup> he repeats nearly the same 
words, except that instead of referring both properties to a "quieting 
of the appetite," he distinguishes appetite and intelligence, and says 
that while the good and the beautiful are
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 149 
--><A NAME="p149"></a>
the same really, yet as mentally distinguished "the good properly has 
reference to the <i>appetite</i> (that being good which is the object 
of all appetite, for which reason rood has the character of an end, and 
appetite the character of a movement to this end): on the other hand 
the beautiful has reference to the cognitive power, for those things 
are beautiful which please in their very contemplation." We may borrow 
an illustration from Cousin,<sup><small><a name="n42"><a href="#n_42">{42}</a></a></small></sup> who contrasts the artistic delight of 
gazing upon a beautifully arranged banquet, with a fear perhaps to 
spoil it by beginning to eat, and the gastronomic delight at the 
prospect of so many good things to eat. As the reason for the delight 
of the intellect in the pure contemplation of the beautiful, St. Thomas 
assigns the pleasure which the mind experiences at beholding therein 
its own likeness<sup><small><a name="n43"><a href="#n_43">{43}</a></a></small></sup> -- something which presents a rational order. "When 
an object is such that it offers several elements at least virtually 
distinct, and these elements conspire to give to the whole a unity, 
each part bearing a proportion to the total nature of the thing; then 
there is offered to the mind an object which delights the gaze, and is 
called <i>beautiful</i>." Hence the beautiful lies in proportion, in 
unity amid variety, or in the combination of the three elements, 
completeness of the whole (<i>integritas, perfectio</i>), harmonious 
relation of parts (<i>debita proportio, consonantia</i>), and, shed 
over all, a certain definiteness, clearness, lustre or splendour 
(<i>claritas</i>).<sup><small><a name="n44"><a href="#n_44">{44}</a></a></small></sup> What will strike the ordinary student of art
<!--
150 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p150"></a>
when he reads the theory of St. Thomas, will be its extreme 
generality, and the utter absence from it of all practical detail. This 
is only what was to be expected. For just as the metaphysical account 
of the <i>good</i>, that it is Being in its relation to appetite or 
will, leaves a whole treatise to be written upon what actions are 
morally good, and what bad: so the metaphysical account of the 
<i>beautiful</i> leaves the several aesthetic treatises, in different 
departments, to be yet excogitated. No painter or sculptor is invited 
to attend the school of General Metaphysics, on the promise, that what 
he there learns will act as substitute for a long technical training in 
his special art, or will enable him to judge definitively between rival 
styles. Ontology simply professes to take the highest generality, 
Being, and to point out how connected, and even identified with its two 
properties, <i>truth</i> and <i>goodness</i>, is another property, 
<i>beauty</i>; which arises when the mere contemplation of the 
<i>good</i>, apart from its possession, gives, pleasure to the mind, 
because of a perceived order in elements really or virtually distinct 
from another. If, therefore, in General Metaphysics the treatment of 
the beautiful is very general and very metaphysical, that is only what 
ought to be.<p>
It may be objected that, on St. Thomas's theory, every object ought to 
be beautiful. As a fact there are some who do not shrink from the 
proposition,<sup><small><a name="n45"><a href="#n_45">{45}</a></a></small></sup> 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH. AND GOODNESS. 151 
--><A NAME="p151"></a>
"Every Being is beautiful;" and if you remind them that some Beings 
are ugly, they reply that as the thesis, "Every Being is good," leaves 
room for a sense in which it can be said "Some Beings are bad," so 
"Every Being is beautiful" may allow a sense in which some Beings are 
ugly. In that case ugliness, like evil, would be explained by 
unsuitable interrelations between parts in themselves unexceptionable. 
Each distinct Being, each <i>ens essentiae</i>, would have its degree 
of beauty, which might be a low one and scarcely perceptible to us: 
while ugliness would arise from the defects due to unsuitable 
combinations. In a gas-light to which is gradually admitted a larger 
and larger supply of gas, the flame is there from the beginning; but it 
is not called bright till it has reached the pitch of intensity -- not 
accurately determinable -- at which we start to call it bright. So 
every Being, as such, has a beauty proper to its nature; but before we 
recognize it as beauty it must have reached a certain degree. Hence 
with Plato and others the beautiful is not merely the true or the good, 
but the <i>splendour</i> of the true or the good, or the 
<i>splendour</i><sup><small><a name="n46"><a href="#n_46">{46}</a></a></small></sup> of order. There must be an element of 
<i>distinction</i>, as Mr. Matthew Arnold would have said, of 
<i>lustre</i>, as Father Faber puts it; and this <i>splendour</i>, or 
<i>distinction</i>, or <i>lustre</i>, is often supplied by some 
pleasing instance of "unity in variety," which  
<!--
152 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p152"></a>
many make to be the very definition of the beautiful.<p>
It may be urged, in remonstrance, that a barn may be built in good 
proportions without beauty; and that it and many other unbeautiful 
objects present "unity in variety," without "splendour" or 
"distinction," or "lustre," which are just the question-begging words, 
to explain which would be to explain precisely wherein the beautiful 
lies; these are what want defining. Perhaps this mention of defining is 
itself a piece of question-begging, if definition be understood in its 
strict sense. For in that case it requires the use, not of mere 
synonyms, but of distinctly simpler terms; and there are those who 
maintain that the <i>true</i>, the <i>good</i>, and the 
<i>beautiful</i> are not really reducible to simpler terms when they 
are considered in their most generalized form; though of course in 
their more particular determinations the elements can be analyzed. At 
any rate some form of the doctrine that the beautiful is based on unity 
amid variety has found extensive acceptance, and a few samples of how 
authors work this theory will be instructive. On this point Sir J. 
Barry says that the disputes about definition do not represent 
corresponding divergencies in the idea itself of the beautiful; and he 
allows the theory of unity in variety on condition that this 
combination be such as to show "fitness and conformity to the design of 
each species." Cousin, dispensing with this limitation, says:<sup><small><a name="n47"><a href="#n_47">{47}</a></a></small></sup> "The 
most probable theory of the beautiful is still
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 153 
--><A NAME="p153"></a>
that which makes it consist of two elements mutually opposed and 
equally necessary; these are unity and variety. Take a beautiful 
flower: undoubtedly it has got unity, order, proportion, symmetry, for 
without these it would lack that intelligible significance, which is 
so marvellously present in all things. But at the same time what 
diversity there is! What delicate shades in the colour, what richness 
in the smallest details! In mathematics themselves what is beautiful is 
not the abstract principle, but the principle bearing with it all its 
long train of consequences. Unity and variety are the notions 
applicable to all orders of beauty." In support of Cousin stands his 
compatriot Lacordaire: "Isolation is the denial of order, of harmony, 
of beauty, since none of these things can be conceived without the 
double idea of plurality and unity. Plurality without unity is positive 
disorder: unity without plurality is negative disorder. In the former 
case the bond is wanting to the things, in the second case the things 
are wanting to the bond." When we have paralleled the words of these 
two French authors with words from two English writers, Cardinal Newman 
and Mr. Ruskin, we may draw a conclusion which is highly practical, 
even though our theoretical analysis of the idea of beauty be judged 
still incomplete. The Cardinal writes with his usual power of 
descriptiveness on the subject of the Divine Beauty: "Order and harmony 
are God's very essence. To be many and distinct in His attributes, yet 
after all to be but One -- to be sanctity, justice, truth, love, power, 
wisdom -- to be 
<!--
154 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p154"></a>
all at once each of these as fully as if He were nothing else but it, 
and as if the rest were not; this implies in the Divine Nature an 
infinitely sovereign and utterly incomprehensible order, which is an 
attribute as wonderful as any, and the result of all the others. Such 
is the unity and consequent harmony and beauty of the Divine Nature." 
The passage from Mr. Ruskin is on a less sacred subject, but its 
teaching is corroborative: "Composition means literally and simply 
putting together several things, so as to make one thing out of them, 
the nature and goodness of which they will all have a share in 
producing. Thus a musician composes an air by putting notes together in 
certain relations; and a painter a picture by putting forms and colours 
in pleasant order. In all these cases observe an intended unity must be 
the result of the composition. Everything should have a determined 
place, perform an intended part, act in that part advantageously for 
everything that is connected with it." The practical lesson is that we 
should improve many of our unpleasing productions by more attention to 
the variety which saves from wearisome monotony, and to unity which 
saves from distraction and pointlessness; and these results are often 
desirable for higher ends than mere artistic effects. So we have gained 
at least one clear advantage from our imperfect study of an aesthetic 
theory, if we have thoroughly grasped what Mr. Tyrwhitt declares to be 
the compendious principle of all artistic composition, namely, "that it 
has several ideas made into one new idea, with skilful use either of 
contrast which
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 155 
--><A NAME="p155"></a>
produces excitement, or of harmony which produces repose, or of both 
together which produces reflective repose."<p>
It would not be well to omit all mention of the fact, that there is a 
great difficulty in the way of defining the beautiful because the use 
of the term is made very elastic. Often it means almost any
pleasure-producing character, in which case the Alisonian theory of 
association becomes very applicable. For we must allow to the 
accidental result of associations much of the charm of many objects 
that are said to be beautiful. Round a name, a phrase, a form, or a 
piece of imagery there may gather a wealth of pleasant feeling which is 
not to be accounted for by the things themselves, but by connected 
circumstances. Again, the vagueness of the term "beautiful" is seen in 
its alternate inclusion and exclusion of what gratifies the sense. Mere 
sense-gratification is not strictly beautiful; and yet the senses feed 
the intellect, and for a composite being like man, much real artistic 
effect depends on a judicious admixture of the elements of sense and 
intellect. Hence art has been called <i>spiritualisatio materialium, et 
materialisatio spiritualium</i>. Excess may be committed on both sides, 
as in M. Tame's overdone rendering of intellectual thoughts into 
sensuous imagery, and in the fondness of a recent English poet for 
abstruse metaphysical expressions to represent physical nature. The 
sense-element, then, has its place, but it is absurd to reduce the 
beautiful to formulas like "the maximum of nerve-stimulation with the 
minimum of fatigue." In this
<!--
156 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p156"></a>
place, however, it is enough to have pointed out that there are 
broader and narrower acceptations of the term, and that these render a 
commonly acceptable definition very hard to frame.<p>
(4) We have given now the properties of Being. Under this heading it is 
not so much the beautiful that the schoolmen are wont to discuss as the 
one, the true, and the good, in which attributes beauty is included, 
though not explicitly declared. Hegelians dislike this triple 
attribution, and think that they have got hold of a more philosophical 
doctrine, when they speak of Quality, Quantity, and Measure. One 
statement of their view is given in brief by Mr. Wallace,<sup><small><a name="n48"><a href="#n_48">{48}</a></a></small></sup> and we 
append it for the cursory inspection of the reader, not believing that 
it merits or will bear deep investigation. "The first part of Logic, 
the theory of Being, may be called the theory of unsupported and 
freely-floating Being. We do not mean something which is, but mere IS, 
the bare fact of Being, without any substratum. The degree of 
condensation or development, when substantive and attribute co-exist, 
has not yet come. The terms and forms of Being float as it were freely 
in the air, or to put it more correctly, one passes into the other. . . 
. This Being is immediate, <i>i.e.</i>, it contains no reference 
binding it with anything beyond itself, but stands forward baldly and 
nakedly, as if alone; and if hard pressed, it turns over into something 
else. It includes the three stages of <i>Quality, Quantity</i>, and 
<i>Measure</i>. The ether of <i>is</i> presumes no substratum, or 
further connexion with
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 157 
--><A NAME="p157"></a>
anything; and we only meet a series of points as we travel along the 
surface of thought. To <i>name</i>, to <i>number</i>, to 
<i>measure</i>, are the three grades of our ordinary and natural 
thought; so simple that one is scarcely disposed to look upon them as 
grades of thought at all. And yet if thought is self-specification, 
what more obvious forms of specifying it are there than to <i>name</i> 
(so pointing it out, or qualifying it), to <i>number</i>, (so 
quantifying it, or stating its dimensions), and to <i>measure</i> it. 
These are the three primary specificates by which we think -- the three 
primary dimensions of thought." We give this merely as a specimen of a 
rival theory which has got acceptance in some of our few philosophic 
strongholds; but by what intrinsic merits of its own we are at a loss 
to discover. The reader is not asked to work at the above extract till 
he fully grasps its meaning; that would be a cruel task to impose upon 
him; but he may take an intelligent interest in catching some glimpse 
of Hegelian method.

NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.<p>
(1) It is one thing to give the definitions in a science like General 
Metaphysics, and another to know the exact mode of their application to 
special cases. It would be preposterous to demand of the logician, who 
describes what "moral certainty" is, to pronounce decisively on the 
degree of credence to be attached to any historical statement whatever, 
which a questioner might bring forward. Similarly when the 
metaphysician has defined an individual to he "some one thing which 
cannot be divided into a plurality of things like to itself," he is not 
thereby obliged to know all about what happens in fissiparous 
generation. If the biologist will tell him exactly what it is that 
happens in this mode of propagation, and what precisely is the truth 
about one or more vital principles, then the metaphysical definition of 
individuality can be easily applied; but till the case is understood, 
the application must wait.<p>
As suggestive cases to show the difficulties which beset the study of 
individuality in detail, we may mention the conception of the physical 
universe, such as it is furnished by Sir William Thomson's vortex 
theory, or by dynamism; the aggregate life in a polypdom; the power of 
some segmented animals, after having been cut in two, to go on living 
as different individuals; the condition of some growths, which appear 
like independent lives, set up within a larger organism. Then there are 
other theories, strange to physical science, but common enough to 
speculative philosophers, which give a curious view of individuality. 
Such is Plato's world-soul or Cudworth's "plastic nature." On the 
latter hypothesis,<sup><small><a name="n49"><a href="#n_49">{49}</a></a></small></sup> "though it is not reasonable to
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 159 
--><A NAME="p159"></a>
think that every plant, herb, or pile of grass <i>hath a plastic life 
of its own</i>, distinct from the mechanism of the body; nor that the 
whole earth is an animal endowed with a conscious soul; yet there may 
be <i>one plastic nature or life belonging to the whole terrestrial 
globe</i>, by which all plants and vegetables continuous with it may be 
differently formed, as also minerals and other bodies framed, and 
whatever else is above the power of fortuitous mechanism effected."<p>
(2) A scholastic dispute about individuality turns on the distinction 
of matter and form. If we go back as far as the Arabian philosopher, 
Avicenna,<sup><small><a name="n50"><a href="#n_50">{50}</a></a></small></sup> we find him teaching that "to assert souls separate from 
matter is to propound an opinion which no philosopher accepts, and what 
is very doubtful. The reason is, that matter is the principle of number 
and plurality." This doctrine as a whole is, of course, repudiated even 
by those among the Christian schoolmen who place the principle of 
individualism in the material component of bodies, not in the form. It 
is a remarkable consequence of this last theory, that its upholders 
find themselves driven on to regard each angel as specifically 
distinct, and to affirm that two angels, because they have no material 
component to give them their individuality, can never be regarded as 
merely individuals of one species; on the other hand, it must be 
recorded that there are schoolmen to whom such a view appears highly 
incomprehensible; and they place individuality in the whole concrete 
nature of a thing, whether matter and form in combination, or form 
alone.<p>
(3) Concerning individuality we must not mix up the different 
questions: (a) what is the efficient cause of the individual? (b) what 
intrinsically constitutes the individual? and (c) what are the outward 
signs by
<!--
160 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p160"></a>
which we practically tell this individual from another? Locke blunders 
here: for just as he confuses a sign of personality, namely, continuous 
self-consciousness with personality itself, and a sign of free-will, 
namely, the power of outward execution with free-will itself, so he 
puts a sign of individuality for its constituent, saying: "The 
principle of individuation, it is plain, is existence itself, which 
determines a Being of any sort <i>to a particular time and place</i>, 
incommunicable to two Beings of the same kind;"<sup><small><a name="n51"><a href="#n_51">{51}</a></a></small></sup> whereupon he 
proceeds to insist, not on the "existence itself," but on the 
"particular time and place." With Locke's view may be compared, but not 
made interchangeable, Leibnitz's principle of "the identity of 
indiscernibles" -- a principle valid enough for an omniscient 
intellect, but not in itself sufficient for a finite intellect, unless 
supplemented by something more positive than mere indiscernibility; for 
we cannot seriously argue that wherever we perceive no diversity, there 
we have identity.<p>
(4) As a specimen of how interpreters endeavour to extract Plato's 
theory about the true and the good, and the priority of the good, we 
may take Mr. R. L. Nettleship's words:<sup><small><a name="n52"><a href="#n_52">{52}</a></a></small></sup> "The sense in which the 
<i>good</i> is used by Plato is, perhaps, most simply and clearly 
illustrated in the familiar expressions: 'What is the good of a thing?' 
'What is a thing good for?'. To conceive a thing as good for something 
is, in the truest sense of the words, nothing more than to conceive it 
as having a meaning, or being intelligible; for strictly speaking, a 
thing of which the elements exist side by side in no order or connexion 
whatever, or a thing which itself exists by the side of other things 
without standing in any expressible relation to them, is to our 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 161 
--><A NAME="p161"></a>
intelligence an inconceivable non-entity. And the moment we mentally 
interpret a thing, or in other words understand it, we give it a reason 
for existing, whether that reason be a form which it assumes, a purpose 
which it serves, a function which it performs, or a substance which it 
is. . . . The world is not an unmeaning chaos, but a something of 
which, however slowly, we are discovering, and not merely inventing, 
the significance. . . . Like the sun in the allegory of the cave, the 
good is the crowning vision in the upward progress of the soul from 
darkness to light, or to speak without metaphor, if the soul, in the 
strength of the dialectical impulse, penetrates right through the 
imagery of sense, and traverses the whole chain of intelligible 
relations, the 'end of the intelligible' at which it arrives, the 
'unhypothetical first principle' upon which it sees the whole structure 
of knowledge to depend, is again the good. In Plato's mind, then, the 
conception of knowledge and truth, the conception of objective reality 
or essence, and the conception of systematic order or cosmos, alike 
implied the conception of a <i>good</i>, which cannot be identified 
with any of them, but is the condition or the logical <i>prius</i> of 
them all." It is upon these last words especially that the critic would 
fix, for the good must be identified with the Being, the Truth, the 
Order of which it is the good: so that whatever priority may, under 
some aspects, be given to the good, it cannot be a priority excluding 
identification.<p>
(5) Aristotle's theory of the beautiful is often referred to; his two 
constituents are "order and size" (<b>to gar kalon en megethei kai 
taxei esti</b>).  By size he means what is not insignificantly small, 
nor yet so large as to be more than the apprehension can well take in 
at once. This brings us near to his doctrine that virtue  
<!--
162 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p162"></a>
consists in the mean; which doctrine again has an affinity with 
certain views taken by Goethe, Wordsworth, G. Eliot, and others. They 
teach that it is mostly in common things that art must find its 
materials, especially in middle-class life, which escapes the 
sordidness of poverty at one extreme and the affectations of luxury on 
the other. A kindred notion again is that of Sir J. Reynolds, with 
regard to the ideal average type. "Most people err," he says in his 
Lectures, "not so much from want of capacity to find their object, as 
from not knowing what object to pursue. This great ideal perfection and 
beauty are not to be sought in the heavens but upon the earth. They are 
about us, and upon every side of us. But the power of discovering what 
is deformed in nature, or in other words, what is particular and 
uncommon, can be acquired only by experience: and the whole beauty and 
grandeur of art consists in being able to get above all singular forms, 
local customs, particularities, and details of every kind." The theory 
is supplemented by what Reynolds writes in his letters to the Idler: "I 
suppose it will easily be granted, that no man can judge whether any 
animal be beautiful of its kind or deformed, who has seen only one of 
that species. . . . The works of nature, if we compare one species with 
another, are all equally beautiful, and preference is given from custom 
or some association of ideas. In creatures of the same species, beauty 
is the medium or centre of its various forms." Mr. Ruskin's variation 
upon this doctrine is, that what nature does rarely will be either very 
beautiful or very ugly; thus he allows that a very wide departure from 
average type may be very beautiful, on which supposition beauty cannot 
be defined as average type.<p>
(6) The pleasure felt at the display of great imitative 
<!--
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 163 
--><A NAME="p163"></a>
skill is often confounded with the beautiful, but is not in itself the 
same thing.<p>
<blockquote>
Il, n'est pas de serpent ni de monstre hideux<br> 
Qui par l'art imit&eacute; ne puisse plaire aux yeux.  
</blockquote><p>
On the other hand, it is not impossible that what is from one aspect 
repulsive may from another have beauty in it: and the selective power 
of the artist will exert its influence in stripping off or hiding away 
what is repellent. "Everything," says Kant, "short of what is nauseous, 
may be made beautiful by artistic rendering. The genius of art frees 
the object from the hampering and distracting circumstances, which hang 
around it in what is called real life, that is to say, frees it from 
association with opinions, wishes, laws, and other conventionalities, 
and lets us see it as an object wrought by nature, expressing, by the 
unsuborned conciliance of its parts and features, a truth typical and 
universal. It does, in short, perfectly and over a wide range what 
ordinary perception does in a few instances."<sup><small><a name="n53"><a href="#n_53">{53}</a></a></small></sup> Still it is only a 
lower stage of art which delights simply in imitation, and is ready, as 
Plato says, to imitate anything and everything.<p>
(7) With regard to the symbolism of various artistic forms, we must 
remember what is true of most conventional signs, that they have a 
suggestion of their use in the nature of things, but that it is left to 
the choice of man to turn this suggestion one way or another. Hence the 
possibility of many interpretations for one symbol. Music, not 
determined by words, is notoriously indefinite; the words of a
well-adapted song give a fixed meaning to the tune, but not in such a 
way that a different song may not be, perhaps equally well, adapted to 
the same tune. Critics, therefore,
<!--
164 BEING 
--><A NAME="p164"></a>
should be careful in not forcing a symbolic meaning on another man's 
work, and in not refusing to accept the artist's own symbolic purpose 
as a justification of what he has done. A wide and wise tolerance is 
needed in these matters, to save the non-artistic world from utter 
distrust in artists, who are ever pronouncing upon each other the 
verdicts of "utterly wrong," "quite out of taste," "devoid of all 
idea," "a confused medley of elements." In art especially we may have 
what in philosophy we try to abolish, namely, an effective use of the 
element of the vague. As a contrast with the clear, definite, correct, 
but somewhat narrow genius of the Greeks, which constantly aimed at 
getting quit of <b>to apeiron</b>, we have the grandeur of a partially 
intelligible vagueness, such as we often find in Holy Scripture when it 
treats of mysteries that are but darkly revealed. As regards finite 
things, however, when these come under human treatment, what is 
sometimes called the obscure element of the finite may easily be 
overstated, till we fall into a sort of pantheism. We may say with Mr. 
Ruskin, that "art is man's delight in God's work," but we feel the need 
of some qualifying phrases before we adopt without reserve Mr. 
Tyrwhitt's comment in his Pictorial Handbook: "As to the beauty of 
nature, it seems to defy all analysis, and this, and its universal 
presence, and the intensely powerful feeling it evokes, seem to point 
to its being a direct manifestation of Divine power. Again, the fact 
that man can produce it in a high perfection, but cannot analyze it, or 
clearly see how he produces it, seems to throw light on the expression 
that man is made in the image of God." All created Being is indeed a 
sort of reflexion from the Divine; but what may be called Platonic 
modes of expressing the fact easily grow exaggerated. But a moderate 
form of Plato's doctrine is what Cardinal
<!--   
UNITY, TRUTH, AND GOODNESS. 165
--><A NAME="p165"></a>
Zigliara is aiming at when he says: "The essence of beauty does not 
consist properly in proportion and neat adaptation, nor in harmony and 
unity of parts; but it consists in that harmony whereby the beautiful 
object corresponds to its archetype, namely, to the light of intellect 
as showing forth the rule and measure of beauty. The original archetype 
is in the Divine mind, the secondary is in the created mind. For we

(8) Of all the attempts to get at the physical basis of certain 
beautiful forms, the science of acoustics has made about the most 
successful in its theory of music. Though it cannot explain everything, 
it can give a fair account why single notes are not mere noises, and 
why the laws of succession and concurrence among several notes are what 
they are. Thus it affords us some means of judging between the two 
extreme theories, that all beauty comes from the arrangement of 
indifferent elements, and that all beauty is resolvable into elements, 
which we must accept as given, but not hope to explain.<p>

according to that which it is: false when it is referred according to 
that which it is not." (St. Thomas, <i>Sum.</i> i. q. xvii. a. i. ad 
1.) Because we are pledged to keep primarily to <i>ens essestiae</i>, 
with us the <i>isness</i> is primarily essential, not evidential.<p>

Green, &c. The last named says, "Every effort fails to trace a genesis 
of knowledge out of anything which is not, in form and principle, 
knowledge itself." (<i>Prolegomena Ethica</i>, p. 75.) Beneke thinks 
that Schleiermacher discovered a fundamental truth in Metaphysics, when 
he observed that <i>living</i> objects are the first to be perceived by 
the senses.<p>
<a name="n_12"><a href="#n12">{12}</a></a> So important is this relation to intellect that St. Thomas says 
truth has its denomination primarily from the intellect. "Verum dicitur 
per pritis de intellectu et per posterius de re intellectui adaequata."

<a name="n_16"><a href="#n16">{16}</a></a> Specimens occur in the <i>Republic</i>, Bks. VI. and VII. The

naturally fell into the doctrine that "the good" stands first in the 
order of reality.<p>
<a name="n_17"><a href="#n17">{17}</a></a> Sum. i. q. v. a. ii. The idea of extending the <i>good</i> beyond 
Being is connected by Egidius with curious etymology. 'A thing is 
called <i>bonum</i> from <i>boare</i>, which means to call; and this is 
the reason why the good is a term of wider extent than Being." The 
explanation may he seen, <i>Dist. xxvii. quaest. ii. art. i. 
Resolutio.</i> St. Thomas, Erigena, and Egidius all refer to the fact 
that mere possibilities. inasmuch as they are objects of desire, are 
good.<p>

privation, see St. Augustine, <i>De Natura Boni</i>; St. John Damascene, 
<i>De Fide Orthodoxa</i>, Lib. IV. c. ii. The schools are divided on 
the point, as to whether it is needful or possible to reduce moral evil 
to the category of a privation. Alexander of Hales, St Bonaventure, 
Scotus, Bellarmine, Suarez, are on the affirmative side, while on the 
negative stand many Thomists, with Cajetan at their head. (In 1a 2ae, q 
xviii. a. v.)<p>
