(1) A SPECIAL aspect of substance is Personality, and this is too 
important an idea to be left without explanation. It is just one of 
those ideas before which an ordinary mind might feel helpless and 
despondent, having yet to learn a great lesson taught by exercise in 
philosophic studies, which is, calmly to take a notion and determine 
how much, so far as we can grasp its object, it includes. Thus only are 
we able to fix for ourselves the signification of a word, and secure 
that, in our meaning at all events, the term has no element of 
vagueness. Unless we acquire this power of precision, we may leave the 
subject of a discussion so indeterminate that no result can be reached. 
It was thus in reference to the ship sent annually by the Athenians to 
Delos; they disputed 
<!--
280 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p280"></a> 
whether it was the same vessel as that in which Theseus sailed a 
thousand years before. The supposed facts of the case may be assumed to 
have been tolerably clear to all: what had been changed and what not, 
probably furnished no serious matter in the dispute; but having no 
fixed definition as to what they intended to mean by sameness in a 
ship, they wrangled without conclusion: whereas a succinct statement of 
the case, ought itself to have solved their difficulty about 
identity.<p> 
(2) All things which can naturally have a separate existence are 
substances, and every existing substance in nature must be individual. 
When an individual substance is complete in itself, forming an entire 
nature, and remaining intrinsically independent, incommunicable, or 
<i>sui juris</i>, it is called a <i>suppositum</i> or 
<i>hypostasis</i>, because to it are attributed all the activities and 
passivities of the thing. The maxim is, <i>Actiones sunt 
suppositorum</i> -- "Actions belong to their respective 
<i>supposita</i>." Thus man is a <i>suppositum</i>, and to his 
<i>suppositum</i> are attributed the slightest movement of a finger, 
and the slightest pain of a tooth. The man moves and the man suffers. 
Hypostasis, therefore, though it has other senses in other connexions, 
is defined in the present connexion, as <i>any single substance which 
is of itself something complete, is not part of another thing, and 
cannot be regarded as a part</i>. This of course is said in reference 
to a physical, intrinsic whole; for extrinsically different 
<i>supposita</i> may be united to form a whole by way of aggregation. 
That precisely which makes a substance to be a hypostasis is 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AS HYPOSTASIS AND PERSONALITY. 281 
--><A NAME="p281"></a> 
frequently called its <i>subsistentia</i>. Furthermore, the hypostasis 
or <i>suppositum</i>, if intelligent, is called a <i>person</i> -- a 
word which meant the "mask" (<b>pros&ocirc;pon</b>) that marked out in 
the stage-player the character he was sustaining. The mask told who the 
wearer was, sacrificing facial expression to ruder and more easily 
perceptible ends, and to the necessities of an enormous theatre, and of 
a highly idealized form of drama. Boethius defines a person as <i>the 
individual substance of rational nature</i>. It is a notable fact that 
all the words here are positive, with the disputable exception of 
"individual," which, however, may easily be regarded in a positive 
light.<p> 
After we have explained in previous chapters substance, essence, and 
individuality, so little more remains to be said in order to give the 
meaning of the term "personality," that readers are apt to overlook the 
account unless it is spread over more pages than are really necessary 
or even helpful to clearness. We have the entire teaching in a 
nutshell, if, starting with the doctrine that a <i>suppositum</i> is a 
substance, complete as a substance, and complete also as some definite 
nature, which forms a whole in and by and for itself, we then add that 
a person is an intelligent <i>suppositum</i>. The highest organisms, 
vegetable or animal, are <i>supposita</i>; but in the mineral world, as 
also in lower forms of life, it is often impossible to assign the 
different <i>supposita</i>. A cup of water is a mere aggregate: perhaps 
the molecules are <i>supposita</i>: but any dispute that arises on this 
point belongs to the department which has to provide a theory of the 
constitution of 
<!--
282 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p282"></a> 
material substances. We have here again another instance like what we 
have had before, in which General Metaphysics furnishes the general 
definition, but does not undertake to settle all its applications 
within the sphere of each special science.<p> 
Every person in the created order will be finite, but if we look back 
at the definition of personality, we shall find that finiteness is no 
part of its contents. A person must have indeed one substance distinct 
from any other substance, but it is nowhere proved that finiteness is 
essential to this distinct unity. Those who allow the unity and the 
infinity of God, and also allow that He is other than any of His 
creatures, should not pretend to a special difficulty on the score of 
his infinite Personality; any objection of theirs would probably have 
at its root the error of Spinoza -- <i>omnis determinatio est 
negatio</i>, "all determination is negation" -- the kindred error of 
the Scotists that personality is rather negative than positive, and the 
views of Hamilton and Mansel about limitation. From the mere analysis 
of the term we should not know whether personality did or did not 
exclude infinity: but reason can demonstrate that God is both infinite 
and personal, and this settles the question. Of course, as far as the 
bare words are concerned, we might have restricted the term "person " 
to finite natures, and have found another term to be applied to God 
alone: that would have been a convention permissible in itself, but not 
without its inconveniences. When we pass on beyond what reason can tell 
us of the Divine 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AS HYPOSTASIS AND PERSONALITY. 283 
--><A NAME="p283"></a> 
personality, we come across the revealed doctrine of three Persons in 
one God. Our definition still meets the requirements, but how it 
discharges its extended functions cannot be explained in this place.<p> 
Besides the Blessed Trinity, another revealed dogma has extended, 
without contradicting, our natural knowledge of personality; for in the 
Incarnate Word we are made aware of two distinct natures in the unity 
of Person. Whence some have concluded that personality is really 
distinct from the created nature of which it is the determinant; but 
other theologians see no necessity for such an extraordinary 
hypothesis. They believe that the Humanity of Christ is not of itself a 
person, not because of anything that it has lost, but because of 
something that it has gained. By virtue of its hypostatic union with 
the Son, it has been elevated to a higher rank without parting with any 
of its reality. The philosophic bearing of these opinions deserves 
notice because it shows that, while we labour to make our terms 
definite and sure as far as our knowledge carries us, we have to 
remember that for the most part it does not carry us to the 
comprehensive intelligence of objects in all their length, breadth, and 
depth. We have a natural knowledge of personality, true as far as it 
goes, but not exhaustive.<p> 
(3) In the last chapter, in the present, and in the next, as well as in 
other places, we have to single out Locke as one who leads the way in 
false doctrine; on the subject of personality his view is fatal to the 
Catholic dogma concerning the Incar<!--
284 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p284"></a>nation, and would render moral retribution highly unsatisfactory in 
its arrangements.<p> 
Because Locke left scholastic subtleties alone, and took to questions 
more on the surface of things, he is sometimes praised as a very clear 
writer. The praise is not warranted on an estimate of his whole work, 
and in many passages he might stand as a warning example of an obscure 
involved style. His treatment of personality as that which is 
constituted by continuous consciousness, is an instance in point, about 
which subject a man with his mind clear could hardly have penned a 
complicated sentence like the following:<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> "That which seems to make 
the difficulty is this, that this consciousness being interrupted 
always by forgetfulness, there being no moment of our lives wherein we 
have the whole train of all our past actions before our eyes in one 
view; but even the best memories losing the sight of one part, whilst 
they are viewing another, and we sometimes, and that the greatest part 
of our lives, not reflecting on our past selves, being intent on our 
present thoughts, and in sound sleep having no thoughts at all, or at 
least none with that consciousness which marks our waking thoughts: I 
say, in all these cases, our consciousness being interrupted, and we 
losing the sight of our past selves, doubts are raised whether we are 
the same thinking thing -- i.e., the same substance or no, which, 
however reasonable or unreasonable, concerns not personal identity at 
all; the question being, what makes 
<!--
A SUBSTANCE AS HYPOSTASIS AND PERSONALITY. 285 
--><A NAME="p285"></a> 
the same person? and not whether it be the same identical substance 
which always thinks in the same person, which in this case matters not 
at all: different substances by the same consciousness (where they do 
partake in it) being united into one person, as well as different 
bodies by the same life are united into one animal, whose identity is 
preserved in that change of substances by the unity of one continued 
life." This remarkable utterance may be taken as somewhat typical of 
the state of Locke's mind on the subject which he is undertaking to 
discuss. We must try to follow some of the meanderings of his famous 
twenty-seventh chapter.<p> 
He seems to have been moved by the reflexions that the parts of the 
human body are ever changing; that there might be rational animals, and 
therefore persons, with bodies quite unlike ours; and that absolutely 
souls might transmigrate from body to body. In view of these 
unfixities, he wants some stable test of identity in persons. He 
distinguishes three identities, those of substance, of man, and of 
person. The first he places in the extrinsic and unsatisfactory 
elements of time and place: "We cannot but conceive that each kind of 
substance must necessarily exclude any of the same kind out of the same 
place; else the notions of identity and diversity would be in vain, and 
there could be no such distinction of substance or anything else one 
from another. Could two bodies be in the same place at the same time, 
then these two parcels of matter must be one and the same; nay, all 
bodies must be one and the same, for all bodies may be in one 
<!--
286 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p286"></a> 
place." After this inconclusive argument, he goes on to speak of his 
second kind of identity, that of man, which he places "in nothing but a 
participation of the same continued life by constantly fleeting 
particles of matter, in succession united to the same organized body." 
It is curious that "man" should thus be limited to matter as organized 
or vivified, when we remember that Locke was a philosopher who believed 
in a soul. But let us hasten on to his third kind of identity, with 
which we are specially concerned. Personal identity is continued 
consciousness: "for nothing but consciousness can unite remote 
existences into the same person; the identity of substance will not do 
it. So that self is not determined by identity or diversity of 
substance, which it cannot be sure of, but only by identity of 
consciousness. . . . Some consciousness always accompanies thinking, 
and it is that which makes every one to be what he calls himself: in 
this alone consists personal identity, that is the sameness of the 
rational being." With the courage to follow out his principles, he does 
not shrink from asserting that could the same consciousness be 
transferred from one thinking substance to another, these two would 
form one person; and that contrariwise one and the same spirit, losing 
old conditions of consciousness and gaining new, would form a plurality 
of persons. Locke carries his consistency into the region of rewards 
and punishments. "If the same Socrates waking and sleeping do not 
partake of the same consciousness, Socrates waking and sleeping is not 
the same person; and to punish Socrates 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AS HYPOSTASIS AND PERSONALITY. 287 
--><A NAME="p287"></a> 
waking for what sleeping Socrates thought and waking Socrates was 
never conscious of, would be no more right than to punish one twin for 
what the other twin did." Of course it is right not to punish Socrates 
waking for what Socrates sleeping did: but the reason is not the one 
assigned by Locke. Our philosopher ventures even to propound and meet a 
difficulty on the subject. Human law, he objects, rightly punishes a 
sober man for what he did in his drunkenness, though, on the principle 
just expounded, there may be two persons here. Yes, answers the 
objector to himself, because human law, not being able to discriminate 
when there are two persons here and when not, punishes for the criminal 
act which can be proved and disregards the unconsciousness of it, which 
cannot be proved. There are many ethical principles violated at this 
juncture. The author places the injurious acts done by the sleep-
walker, whose state is not his own fault, in the same order with those 
done by the drunken man, whose state with its foreseen consequences is 
generally his own fault, proximately or remotely. Again, he uses 
probability against, instead of in favour of, the accused: saying that 
because unconsciousness of guilt cannot be proved, consclousncss can be 
presumed. But if we make our presumption from known facts, we may come 
to a fair conclusion as to whether a man was drunk or not, and then we 
may add our further piece of knowledge that a really drunken man has 
not, at the time of his action, a genuine consciousness of wrong-doing. 
Again, on Locke's principles a 
<!--
288 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p288"></a> 
criminal who afterwards lost all memory of his deeds could not be 
condemned for a whole life of previous crime. An atrocious murderer, 
who in the interval between his capture and his trial had undergone a 
sickness which wiped out the recollection of the act from his own mind, 
would have to be released if he could prove his complete obliviscence. 
Or, perhaps, there is this subterfuge for Locke, and he is welcome to 
it. The criminal ought to believe his guilt on the testimony of others: 
thus once more it enters into his consciousness, and belongs to the 
culprit's personality. When Locke adds piously, "In the great day, 
wherein the secrets of hearts shall be laid open, it may be reasonable 
to think that no one will be made to answer for what he knows nothing 
of," our philosopher is quite safe in his conjecture, so far as it is 
expressed ; but if it implies that the Judge will ignore all things 
which men have no memory of when they die, simply because they have no 
memory of them, then the notion is very much astray. On the side of the 
offended man, "forgive and forget" is often a good maxim to follow; but 
on the side of the offender forgiveness obtained by means of his own 
forgetfulness is a doctrine that has not recommended itself even as a 
heresy.<p> 
Locke's teaching about personality may in the end be acknowledged to 
have these results: (a) it furnishes a definition which would suffice 
for Hume's theory of man as a series of conscious states without 
substance: (b) it steers clear of the awkward facts that if there were 
rational animals 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AS HYPOSTASI5 AND PERSONALITY. 289 
--><A NAME="p5"></a> 
other than man, we should have either to extend the term man, or add 
to its definition as "rational animal:" and that if human souls did 
transmigrate, our definition of man's personality would have to 
accommodate this change. If it be asked whether we cannot further 
accord to Locke's definition that it gives what personality, as a term, 
might mean, we reply that the word has got its accepted signification 
too well fixed to allow an individual to change it at will. The most we 
can grant to Locke is that continued consciousness is one test of 
personality; we cannot grant that it is personality. If because of the 
intimate connexion of thought with personality we permitted Locke to 
turn thought into personality, how should we resist Cousin, who because 
personality is asserted specially in the will, says, <i>La 
volont&eacute; c'est la personne</i>; and again, <i>Qu'est-ce que le 
moi? L'activit&eacute; volontaire et libre</i>. A long way the best 
plan is to keep to the theory that the person of man is the composite 
nature, body and soul, left in its completenes and <i>sui juris</i>; 
the soul being substantially unchangeable, though variable in its 
accidental states, the body being constantly changed as to its 
constituent particles, yet preserving a certain identity, describable 
only by reciting what are the facts of waste and repair in an organism. 
It is a great secret in the explanation of many puzzling terms to know, 
that the only way is concisely to declare the known facts which the 
word is meant to express. Thus we describe in what man's bodily 
identity consists so far as we can. A limb may be lost, and that 
mutilation may be followed by the 
<!--
290 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p290"></a> 
loss of another limb; we hardly know the extent to which a body may be 
deprived of its parts; still so long as the man lives, we know that he 
is the same person, constituted by the union of the same soul and body. 
His integrity is gone, but not his personality.<p> 
From Locke's insistance on the connexion between unity of consciousness 
and unity of personality, though he carries it to an extreme which 
would logically require the assertion of two persons in Jesus Christ, 
we may borrow a warning against the impersonal intelligence, of which 
so much is made by many philosophers, of which they can give so little 
account, and of which their proof, if they attempt one, is so utterly 
unconvincing. The doctrine is quite to be rejected that a primeval 
intelligence, impersonal in itself, becomes personal only in finite 
intelligences such as our own. Probably in the natural condition of 
things, every finite intelligence is a sign of a single personality; 
but in the supernatural union of Christ's Humanity with the Person of 
the Word, the human intelligence foregoes the personality which would 
otherwise be proper to it, and is taken up by a higher personality in 
some way quite mysterious to us, and known at all to us, only because 
we have been told so by absolutely credible authority. Even so we do 
not come across that most unphilosophical invention of philosophers, 
"the impersonal intelligence:" for the human intelligence of Christ is 
personal with the personality of the Second Person of the Blessed 
Trinity. If it had not been thus 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AS HYPOSTASIS AND PERSONALITY. 291 
--><A NAME="p291"></a> 
assumed to a higher hypostasis, it would have had its own natural 
personality; in all cases it must be personal.<p> 
(4) Hume, as usual, carries Locke's expressions to greater extremes; 
denying the knowableness of any such substantial nature as that which 
his predecessor undoubtedly considered to underlie the phenomena of 
consciousness, and which he calls "the identity of man." The most 
outspoken utterances of Hume are to be found in the Appendix to his 
Treatise on Human Nature. There he plainly confesses the defectiveness 
of his theory; he owns that "all hopes vanish" when he tries to 
explain, on his principles, the bonds which unite the successive states 
of consciousness. Nevertheless he abides by his own philosophy, because 
"all our distinct perceptions are distinct existences, and the mind 
never perceives any real connexion among distinct existences." Hence, 
pleading "the privileges of a sceptic," there is nothing for him but to 
acknowledge himself at present beaten by "a difficulty too hard" for 
his understanding. Still he is a sceptic only in the etymological 
sense; he does not finally renounce the knowledge of the truth, he 
merely avows that for him truth is yet to seek. Perhaps even still, 
"upon mature refiexion," he may be so lucky as to "discover some 
hypothesis that will reconcile the contradictions." Meantime he can 
give this account of his own personality: "For my part when I enter 
into what I call myself, I always tumble upon some particular 
perception or other; I can never catch <i>myself</i> at any time 
without a perception, and can 
<!--
292 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p292"></a> 
never observe anything but the perception. When my perceptions are 
removed for any time, as by sound sleep, so long am I insensible of 
myself, and may be truly said not to exist. . . . Setting aside some 
metaphysicians, I may venture to affirm of the rest of mankind that 
they are nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, 
which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity and are in a 
perpetual flux and movement.<p> 
There is properly no simplicity in the mind at one time, nor identity 
in different." Thus personality is "a fiction of the imagination;" it 
is "the smooth passage of our thoughts along our resembling 
perceptions, that makes us ascribe to them an identity."<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AS HYPOSTASIS AND PERSONALITY. 293  
--><A NAME="p293"></a><p> 
It is not necessary to examine later developments of Hume; but there is 
one recent investigation which should be mentioned in connexion with 
the reduction of personality to conscious states. Because of the 
duality or even higher plurality, which can be produced apparently in 
consciousness by certain morbid conditions, some speak of a 
multiplicity of persons in one man: we must reject the phrase in its 
literal sense, because of the reasons already given. It is no wonder if 
with our complex conditions there are abnormal states, in which 
consciousness is said to testify to strange things. This alleged 
testimony, however, especially when the report is given on the mere 
memory of a past condition of disturbance, cannot be accepted with 
implicit trust, for the memory of a period of abnormal action may 
easily be distorted.  
<!--
294 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p294"></a><p> 
NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.<p> 
(1) It was undoubtedly Christianity which set men inquiring more 
carefully into the nature of personality, for the two prime mysteries 
of the Trinity and the Incarnation turned on this idea. The maxim, 
<i>actiones sunt suppositorum</i>, obtained for the latter of the two 
dogmas a great significance, which brought out the unity and, the 
dignifying influence of personality. Reid insists that a person must be 
taken as a monad, as a whole, and never as a part; and this is 
eminently true in estimating the worth of Christ's human actions. "All 
men, he says,<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> "place their personality in something that cannot be 
divided. . . . When a man loses his estate, his health, his strength, 
he is still the same person and has lost nothing of his personality. If 
he has a leg or an arm cut off, he is still the same person as before. 
. . . My personal identity, therefore, implies the continued existence 
of that indivisible thing which I call myself. Whatever this self may 
be, it is something which thinks, and deliberates, and resolves, and 
acts, and suffers. I am not thought, I am not action, I am not feeling; 
I am something that thinks, and acts, and suffers. My thoughts and 
actions and feelings change every moment -- they have no continued, but 
a successive existence; but the self or I to which they belong is 
permanent, and has the same relation to all the succeeding thoughts, 
actions, and feelings, which I call mine."<p> 
From these words some might gather that only the thinking principle in 
man is his person; indeed, we hear it said, "Man is a soul." But if we 
keep to our definition, and if we remember that the body is an 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AS HYPOSTASIS AND PERSONALITY. 295 
--><A NAME="p295"></a> 
essential constituent of human nature, we must include it also in the 
personality.<p> 
(2) The dignity of personality is explained by Schelling as consisting 
in "lordship." As Chalyb&auml;us<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> interprets him, "To be lord over 
one's existence constitutes the idea of personality -- to be lord over 
all existence constitutes the idea of absolute personality. The Deity 
is such from the beginning." So much truth as underlies these words has 
been given by us, when we described a person as <i>sui juris</i>: to 
the conscious personal Being its own existence is <i>for itself</i>, 
and whatsoever other existences serve its known ends, so far they also 
are <i>for it</i>, even though a Higher Lord may claim to be the 
absolutely ultimate centre of reference.<p> 
(3) Self-consciousness is no doubt closely connected with personality, 
and has a special power in making a thing <i>exist for itself</i>. 
Lotze, speaking of the very common theory that all things have souls, 
says that his own reasoning on the point "does not demand anything more 
than that there should belong to things, in some form or other, <i>that 
existence as an object for itself</i> which distinguishes all spiritual 
life from what is only <i>an object for something else</i>.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> "Hence," 
he says, "we must believe that there are other persons like ourselves, 
but not that there are any mere things." Holding the monistic doctrine 
that there is only one Being, within this Being he allows only such 
objects to claim an existence of their own as can refer their states to 
a self. "It is so far as something is an object to itself, relates 
itself to itself, distinguishes itself from something else, that by 
this act of its own it detaches itself from the Infinite. . . . 
Whatever is in a condition to feel and assert itself as a self is 
entitled to be described as <i>outside</i> the all 
<!--
296 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p296"></a> 
comprehensive Being." Dr. Martineau is not a follower of Lotze, but, 
in denying to mere things, and indeed to all objects that have not 
free-will, a real causality, he comes near to the German 
philosopher.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> "All cosmic power is Will; and all cosmic Will is 
God's. The natural forces are numerically distinguished, only because 
they are assembled in different families of phenomena, but dynamically, 
they pass to and fro; they are subject to the same measure; they are 
substantially indifferenced; and the unity to which they converge is 
nothing else than His. He is the one cause in nature, acting in various 
modes, and to all else among physical things that has borrowed the 
name, we may give a free discharge. We cannot have these 'second 
causes' idle on our hands." The only "second cause" is personal, and 
created personality is thus contrasted with the physical universe.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> 
"In the ultra-physical sphere, the whole tendency is precisely the 
reverse, viz., away from the original unity of power into 
differentiation and multiplicity, the end pursued by the will of the 
Creator is here to set up what is other than himself and yet akin, to 
mark off new centres of self-consciousness and causality, that have 
their separate history and build up a <i>free personality like his 
own</i>. We have seen how conceivable it is that, without prejudice to 
the Providential order of the world, he should realize this end, by 
simply <i>parting with a portion of his power to a deputed agent</i>, 
and abstaining so far from necessary law. Now this Divine move, this 
starting of minds and characters, making the universe alive with 
multiplied causality, is quite different from the transitory waves of 
physical change that skim their deep and lapse: it brings upon the 
stage, not an event, 
<!--
SUBSTANCE AS HYPOSTASIS AND PERSONALITY. 297 
--><A NAME="p297"></a> 
but an existence: not an existence merely, but <i>an ordering and 
electing and creative existence</i>, a thinking power which is not a 
mere phenomenon of the Supreme Mind, for <i>that</i> would not 
constitute a mind at all: how can a state of one conscious subject be 
another conscious subject? . . . <i>Personality</i> is not the largest, 
but it is the highest fact in the known cosmos." Our next chapter will 
discuss "second causes," and we shall see whether that title is to be 
denied to all impersonal objects.<p> 
(4) Some wonder that Catholic theologians insist so much on the 
<i>personal</i> character of the offence which is committed in sin 
against God, and they would lay more stress on the intrinsic 
inordinateness of acts. But if we take as the complement of <i>actiones 
sunt suppositorum</i>, the maxim, <i>passiones sunt suppositorum</i>, 
then we shall see the propriety of measuring sin especially by personal 
considerations. It is true that there must be intrinsic inordinateness 
in the sinful acts themselves; but given this, we gauge its full 
deformity only by looking at it on the personal side. We have not the 
complete idea of sin till we have grasped it as a crime committed by a 
personal agent against a personal superior. It has been by tracing the 
work of the actions of the Man Christ to His Divine Personality, that 
Catholic theologians have, by contrast, become so keenly alive to the 
personal element in sin. Moral worth is essentially something personal, 
even though in finite agents at least, the personal worth of the doer 
of a deed is not atraightway the worth of the deed, which has to be 
judged by its object and circumstances, but still the personal element

<a name="n_2"><a href="#n2">{2}</a></a> <i>Treatise</i> I. iv. &sect; 2. Mr. Spencer's views are given in 
his  <i>Psychology</i>, Part VII. cc. xvi. and xvii. He is mostly 
concerned with distinguishing between the objective "vivid states" of 
consciousness, and subjective "faint states" and showing the 
intermediate position of a man's own body in relation to the two 
classes. "In some way or other there is attached to the faint aggregate 
a particular portion of the vivid aggregate, and this is unlike all the 
rest as being a portion always present, as having a special coherence 
among its components, as having known limits, as having comparatively 
restricted and well-known combinations, and especially as having in the 
faint aggregate the antecedents of its most conspicuous changes, which 
prove to be the means of setting up special changes in the rest of the 
vivid aggregate. This special part of the vivid aggregate, which I call 
my body, proves to be a part through which the rest of the vivid 
aggregate works changes in the faint, and through which the faint works 
certain changes in the vivid. And in consequence of its intermediate 
position, I find myself now regarding this body as belonging to the 
vivid aggregate, and now as belonging to the same whole as the faint 
aggregate, to which it is intimately related." These are fair specimens 
of the best things Mr. Spencer has left to say; after he has renounced 
all right to speak of a substance of body or of mind, and has left 
himself nothing to describe but two ultimately distinguished groups of 
faint and of vivid feelings, which have, as the mediator between them, 
the philosopher's own aggregate of feelings which he calls his body. It 
is only Hume continued. To account for the common opinion Mr. Spencer 
adds, "There is an illusion that at each moment the Ego is something 
more than the aggregate of feelings and ideas, actual or nascent, which 
then exists." (c. ix. &sect; 220.)<p>
