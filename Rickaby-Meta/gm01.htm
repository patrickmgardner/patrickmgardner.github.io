(1) WHAT is the subject-matter of the science of General Metaphysics? 
Is it true that, according to the old sarcasm which is repeated with 
many variations, when Metaphysics is being discussed, teacher and 
learner can only put on a look of wisdom and pretend to a mutual 
understanding, but really have no precise idea what they would be at, 
with all their high-sounding phrases? There are, no doubt, some schools 
claiming the name of metaphysical that merit the contempt thus poured 
upon them;  
<!--
2 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p2"></a>
but the fault is in their treatment of the subject, not in the subject 
itself, which admits of most accurate and intelligible statement.<p>
To learn what the <i>metaphysical</i> is we must start with an 
explanation of the <i>physical</i>. By things <i>physical</i> are very 
commonly understood, though not universally, the material objects 
around us, which, appealing to the senses, form the first and 
proximately proportionate objects of human intelligence; and this, at 
present, shall be our sense of the term. Whatever was the original 
meaning of that other word <i>metaphysical</i>, Metaphysics as a 
science now implies <i>a passing beyond the physical</i>, which passage 
may be effected with different degrees of thoroughness. Even the 
physical sciences themselves so far transcend or overstep physical 
conditions, that they go beyond the individual differences between 
things, and formulate laws for a whole class at a time. This much 
generality every science must have according to the maxim, "There is no 
science of singulars." The mathematician advances a step further; out 
of all material properties he retains only one, that of quantity or 
extension.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> In a well-developed language there are numerals which, in 
their present state, bear no noticeable reference to anything beyond 
abstract quantity; though in their original force they have appeared as 
largely "immersed in matter." We may contrast, for example, such 
concrete measures as a <i>nail, palm, hand, span, foot, cubit</i>, with 
the more abstract <i>metre</i> and its multiples;  
<!--
NATURE AND NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 3
--><A NAME="p3"></a>
or, better still, some Hindu symbols with our more perfect numerals. 
Mr. Tylor tells us that in the former the sun or the moon stands 
numerically for one; a pair of eyes, wings, or jaws for two; fire, with 
its supposed triplicity of qualities for three, and so forth. Similarly 
we find the ruder tongues betraying their imperfect power of 
abstracting numerals from the matters numbered in such phrases as, "boy 
five-man," for "five boys;" "man five-fingers," for "five men." Now the 
process of abstraction once begun in Physics and in Mathematics, needs 
but to be continued and it carries us to Metaphysics. It was a remark 
made by Hegel, that the Pythagorean attempt to apprehend the universe 
as number, was the first step to Metaphysics. In this latter science we 
reach not merely pure extension as an idea, but leaving even this 
remnant of materiality behind us, we arrive at conceptions such as 
Being, Existence, Essence, Unity, Substance, Accident, Action, which 
may be applied either to matter or to spirit indifferently, for they 
contain no necessary reference to one order rather than to the other. 
Here in fact we have got a real Metaphysics, and indeed the most 
metaphysical part of Metaphysics, such as Kant and our English empirics 
have declared to be impossible. But <i>ab esse ad posse valet 
illatio</i> -- "the inference from actual result to its possibility is 
valid."<p>
The illustrations we have given belong to what is known under the name 
of <i>General</i> as distinguished from <i>Special</i> Metaphysics, the 
requirement for the former being that it should abstract from every 
<!--
4 BEING.
--><A NAME="p4"></a>
character which is peculiar either to spirit or to matter. In the 
strict sense it should be an Ontology, treating only of what is common 
to all Being; and if ever this rigour is relaxed, it must be understood 
to be a relaxation, such as occurs in certain sections that apply to 
all created Being, but not to the Uncreated. The various treatises of 
Special Metaphysics consider properties, some distinctly material, 
others distinctly spiritual; but they keep up the claim to their title 
of Metaphysics, because they go beyond Physics in the narrow meaning of 
the word. Practically Physics trespass on the metaphysical territory; 
but if they remained within their closest bounds they would confine 
themselves to formulating the laws of sequence and co-existence among 
sense-phenomena without entering into the questions of substance, 
cause, and so forth. Very laudably physical treatises employ a little 
Metaphysics. Mathematics, also, we sometimes call metaphysical, not 
because they really soar beyond all that is sensible, but because the 
one sensible quality which they retain, is considered by them under a 
supersensible aspect, as the most abstract form of extension or 
quantity.<p>
It would seem that Logic should come under Special Metaphysics; but 
because, while on the one hand Metaphysics deals with the real, Logic, 
on the other hand, is very largely concerned with what we shall soon 
have to speak about as "second intentions," for this reason, the 
logical is often contrasted with the metaphysical. For a different 
reason some would not rank Moral Science as a branch of Special 
Metaphysics. And yet the word metaphysical, if 
<!--
NATURE AND NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 5
--><A NAME="p5"></a>
applied to Logic and Morals, might retain the meaning we have attached 
to it; for these are engaged upon considerations beyond the physical or 
sensible order. It is merely one out of many instances, where a word 
successively widens and narrows its signification.<p>
(2) After broadly characterizing the study of Metaphysics, we may now 
go further and contend, that not only has General Metaphysics a 
position by the side of the other sciences, but that no other science 
can be real if General Metaphysics is not so. For obviously if Being, 
Substance, Cause, and such like notions are unreal, then no concrete 
fact can be seized in its reality and put into a real science. We do 
not say that there exists any object which is simply Being, or 
Substance, or Cause in general; but we do say that if these general 
notions are invalid, no notion of the singular and concrete object can 
be valid, for with the general is indissolubly bound up the fate of the 
particular. Hence it is worth the while of those who indulge in a deal 
of cheap wit about the superior security of Physics over Metaphysics, 
to remember that the two causes are not opposite, nor even independent, 
but most strictly interconnected. No Physics without Metaphysics; no 
Metaphysics without at least a sufficient starting-ground in Physics. 
It follows that Metaphysics has, not only the other requirements of 
Comte for "positive" knowledge, namely "reality," "certainty," and 
"precision," but also "utility," if we raise the meaning of the term 
above its lower level of gross materialism.
<!--
6 BEING.  
--><A NAME="p6"></a><p>
And here Metaphysics has distinctly suffered from some metaphysicians
-- of course bad ones -- who have broken up the essential union of 
things. They have spoken of "empty Being," or more correctly, "Being in 
its most abstract form," as though it had a sort of distinct existence 
from physical nature, or entered as a really distinct component into 
concrete objects. Hence the magnificent utterance -- magnificent in its 
simplicity  -- "I am Who am," has been taken to signify that the 
origin of all things should be regarded as a Being quite indeterminate 
to start with, having no attributes, no concrete essence, but a bare 
existence, which is the existence of nothing in particular." We, at any 
rate, disclaim all pretence to assert for every metaphysical 
abstraction of the mind a corresponding distinction in things 
themselves: we go on the principle that whether a mental distinction 
has its counterpart also in reality, is a point to be settled on the 
merits of each case in detail. We are satisfied if the character 
abstracted by the metaphysician is real, and we leave it to further 
investigation whether it is a reality complete in itself, or only one 
real character intrinsically bound up with other real characters, which 
together with it constitute a unity, not really divisible but only 
mentally distinguishable.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Thus we guarantee that objects are really 
Beings; we do not say that mere Being can be the whole of any reality, 
or even an actually distinct part.
<!--
NATURE AND NEED OF METAPHYSICS.  7
--><A NAME="p7"></a><p>
(3) Metaphysics, then, in the proper understanding of the term, we 
have pronounced to be an essential for the foundation of all real 
science. Whereupon we fancy that we hear the plaintive appeal, If 
Metaphysics we must have, of course we will submit; but at least let us 
have Metaphysics in moderation, by which we mean mainly two things: 
first, that only positive doctrine, not controverted opinions, be 
presented to us, and secondly, that the positive doctrine confine 
itself to substantials, without making excursions into the nooks and 
corners that skirt the way, simply for the sake of peering into 
curious recesses.<p>
Replying to the latter demand first, we promise that we will try to 
keep chiefly to the principal terms, such as <i>Being, Essence, 
Existence, Substance, Cause</i>, and explain them; next, as to the 
avoidance of controversy, that cannot be wholly attained without most 
serious loss. The man who will not listen to the main difficulties 
against a true theory, often fails to acquire a spirit of due caution; 
he has no fear of committing himself, no sufficient sense of the need 
of qualifications in statements, no thoroughness such as the real 
student always wants, and distinctly misses where it is not present. 
When, however, it comes to the question, Which are the adverse views 
which it will be profitable to notice? opinions are sure to differ, if 
only because the differences of interest that have been aroused. One 
man who sees no reason why Hegel should be mentioned, remembers 
sufficient of Mansel's lectures to feel a deficit when points raised by 
him are 
<!--
8 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p8"></a>
passed over without notice. Another man declares that Mansel's day is 
over, and perhaps ought never to have been; but that Hegel is a living 
power in the country, and ought decidedly to be reckoned with. Thus 
what to one is a very interesting quotation, to another is a vexatious 
impertinence. Without any offence we may be permitted the two remarks, 
that professed moderation of appetite for variety in philosophical 
opinions, may easily be a cloak for sluggishness -- a part of that 
shrinking from labour which is so common in intellectual undertakings; 
and next, that with an increasing breadth of knowledge there is an 
increasing need felt for yet wider information. The stream of Greek 
thought often flowed very clear and straight, but then it was, for the 
most part, a narrow stream; the current of modern thought, in its best 
examples, is also clear and makes straight for its purpose, but its 
broader expanse requires a greater range of vision in him who would 
watch its course, and a weak-eyed observer may easily fancy that it is 
but an aimless waste of waters. The honest critic will try to make sure 
that he is right, before he ventures to say that a complex line of 
discussion is wanting in closeness of reasoning.<p>
In the effort to keep controversy within bounds we shall regard the 
aberrations of our native school of thought -- the school of Hume -- as 
calling for our most explicit notice; with some of its errors we must 
distinctly grapple. About Hegelianism we shall say less, but we cannot 
afford quite to ignore it, because it has a strong foothold in the 
Univer<!--
NATURE AND NEED OF METAPHYSICS. 9 
--><A NAME="p9"></a>sities and in the recent edition of the <i>British 
Encyclopoedia</i>; read, for instance, the article entitled, 
<i>Metaphysic</i>. Just because we are not going expressly to combat 
Hegel, at the several points where we come into conflict with his 
theories, it is fitting, at the outset, to declare our general mode of 
opposition to him, which is one for the most part of indirect 
encounter. The matter which we treat in Metaphysics he gives in what he 
calls Logic. For, declaring the Logical Idea to be the Unity and 
Totality of Things, or God, and identifying Thought and Thing, he has 
consequently no separate place for an Ontology as distinguished from 
Logic. Accordingly the three divisions of his Logic are, the 
<i>Doctrine of Being</i>, the <i>Doctrine of Essence</i>, the 
<i>Doctrine of the Notion</i>. If the theory of knowledge already 
defended In another volume of this Series, <i>First Principles</i>, is 
correct, then Hegelianism is  radically wrong and needs no further 
confutation: the doctrine of Ideal Realism, which identifies the Real 
and the Ideal, falls to the ground. If, however, we must here give some 
explicit reason why we reject the Metaphysics of Hegel, we may put in 
the plea of a laudable "impenetrability to his ideas" -- of an almost 
utter insusceptibility; his doctrines "pass by as the idle wind which 
we regard not." For he fails in presenting for our acceptance 
propositions in themselves sufficiently intelligible to be assented to 
with an intellectual assent; he fails in giving us clear reasons why 
his several propositions should be accepted, even as mysteries beyond 
comprehension, yet credible on extrinsic grounds; he fails in the 
<!--
10 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p10"></a>
very fact that he appeals to a Reason (<i>Vernunft</i>) which is above 
the plain Understanding (<i>Verstand</i>) and contrary to it. As to the 
last particular, we fully admit the limitations and the imperfections 
of the understanding; the many distinctions it has to make which are 
only mental and not real; its inversions of the order of nature in its 
own order of discovering the facts of nature; but our means of meeting 
these deficiencies is to recognize them and allow a proportionate 
discount for them, not to assume the existence of a higher function of 
mind, which shall set at defiance what are commonly regarded as 
essential laws of thought. We completely reject a Reason which 
contradicts the plain Understanding, and which, under pretence of 
supremacy over it, tries to impose upon us much unmeaning phraseology 
as though it were highest wisdom. Such is a brief statement of our case 
against Hegel on general grounds; in detail we shall occasionally make 
mention of his doctrines by way of specimen, or contrast, or 
suggestion.<p>
We hope, therefore, on the plan laid down, to secure a certain degree 
of comprehensiveness in our treatment without passing the bounds of 
moderation; to present a course to our reader which will call for a 
steady effort of attention, but not for a strain that is excessive; to 
write something more than a compendium, or humdrum text-book, but not a 
disquisition painful in its minutiae.<p>
