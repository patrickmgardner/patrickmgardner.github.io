<center><h4>CHAPTER II.<br>
THE NOTION OF BEING.</h4></center><ul><p>
<i>Synopsis.</i><p>
(1) In face of the very great confusion that prevails on the 
subject, it is needful to determine on some clear signification of the 
word Being.<p>
(2) A settlement of this meaning. (a) Being is whatever is capable of 
actual existence, whether it exist or not: quod aptum est ad 
existendum: it means an essence, a thing, a something, in the most 
abstract sense of the term. (b) This use of the word Being is partly a 
convention, but a legitimate convention. (c) Being, so understood, is 
always real; and the understanding of this reality is important in view 
of various errors.<p>
(3) Being may be regarded as neither a generic, nor a universal notion.<p>
(4) Three first principles springing straight from the idea of Being.<p>
<i>Notes and Illustrations.</i></ul><p>
(1) A WHOLE chapter devoted to the elucidation of so simple a notion as 
that of Being, must seem to some "Much Ado about Nothing," and quite 
enough at the opening of a book to condemn it of triviality. "Of 
Being," writes Mr. M'Cosh,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> "very little can be said; the mistake of 
metaphysicians lies in saying too much. They have made assertions 
which have, and can have, no meaning, and landed themselves in
self-created mysteries, or in contra<!--
12 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p12"></a>dictions. So little can be said of Being, not because of the 
complexity of the idea, but because of its simplicity. We can find 
nothing simpler into which to resolve it." On the other hand, there are 
writers who seem to suppose that Being is an idea too abstruse for 
human investigation: and we find both Voltaire and Goethe indulging in 
the thin witticism, that in regard to Being they understood about as 
much as their teachers, which was very little.<p>
Not because a notion is simple is it therefore beyond the need of 
accurate determination by reflexion; and not because a notion is the 
most fundamental of all, is it, therefore, a mystery above our powers 
of research. Being calls for our investigation, to which call we are 
competent to respond, nor are we so contemptuous as to withhold the 
answer in disdain. Therefore, lest anybody should be inclined to 
persist in the opinion, that every one who has come to the use of 
reason must sufficiently understand what Being is, without going to 
Metaphysics; or in the opposite opinion that Being is a notion too 
subtle for human comprehension, we will set about the refutation first 
of the one error, and then of the other. A mere assertion may make 
little impression, but assertion backed by proof ought to leave its 
mark. We do not want the reader to fathom the meaning of all the 
passages we are about to cite; we only want him to gather from them a 
deep-felt conviction, that the term Being has been involved in sad 
confusion. The point can be established only in one way, and that 
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 13 
--><A NAME="p13"></a>
is by the quotation of instances, to which we at once proceed.<p>
Sparing ourselves the relation of how Hegel manages to identify Being 
with not Being, we will begin with an author whom we have often to 
encounter in the course of this treatise. Hume<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> says, "Any idea we 
please to form is the idea of a Being, and the idea of a Being is any 
idea we please to form." This is very liberal; but others try to find 
an opposition between Being and some other term. One common antithesis 
is set up between Being and Thought, so that the former stands for 
every object of thought, or as it has been styled, <i>das reine 
Gegen&uuml;ber</i>, mere "over-against-ness," or the <i>non-ego</i> as 
set over against the thinking <i>Ego</i>. Hereupon people begin to 
inquire whether the opposition is complete, or whether thought itself 
is not Being; and then, perhaps, they venture on the suggestion that 
the true antithesis to Being is, not thought, but nonentity or nothing. 
Meantime Being is not explained.<p>
Another device is to regard Being as the same with actuality or 
existence. "Being," says Mill,<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> "is originally the present participle 
of a verb, which in one of its meanings is exactly equivalent to the 
verb <i>exists</i>, and therefore suitable even by its grammatical 
formation to be the concrete of the abstract <i>existence</i>. But this 
word, strange as the fact may appear, is still more completely spoiled 
<!--
14 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p14"></a>
for the purpose which it seemed expressly made for than the word 
<i>thing</i>. Being is by custom exactly synonymous with 
<i>substance</i>, except that it is free from a slight taint of a 
second ambiguity, being applied impartially to matter and to mind, 
while <i>substance</i>, though originally and in strictness applicable 
to both, is apt to suggest in preference the idea of matter. Attributes 
are never called Beings, nor are feelings. A Being is that which 
excites feelings and possesses attributes." In another place<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> he 
surmises that a distinction which, in spite of many prior claimants,<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> 
he puts down to the credit of his father, will rid us of an ambiguity, 
while against certain philosophers whom he accuses of having brought 
about darkness where they professed to be shedding light, he has strong 
denunciations to make. "Many volumes might be filled with the frivolous 
speculations concerning the nature of Being (<b>to on</b>, 
<b>ousia</b>, <i>ens, entitas, essentia</i>, and the like), which have 
arisen from overlooking the double meaning of the word <i>to be</i>; 
from supposing that when it signifies to exist and when it signifies to 
be some specified thing, as to be a man to be Socrates, to be seen or 
spoken of, or even to be a non-entity, it must still at bottom answer 
to the same idea, and that a meaning must be found for it that shall 
still suit all the cases."<p>
Mill is not exactly leading us to a definite  
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 15 
--><A NAME="p15"></a>
settlement of terms, but he is showing us, and exemplifying in his own 
practice, the vagueness of usage. Let us take him up at the point where 
he declares, that "Being is suitable, even by its grammatical 
formation, to be the concrete of the abstract <i>existence</i>." Then, 
it means an existent thing, or an actual object; and what we want next 
to see is, how far Mill agrees with his friend, Mr. Bain, as to the 
meaning of Being as the same with existence.<p>
Against Mill Mr. Bain contends, that because ideas are knowable only in 
opposite pairs, and because there is no positive opposite to 
<i>existence</i>, but only the negation, <i>non-existence</i>, 
therefore there is no distinct and peculiar idea, <i>existence</i>. 
"The word <i>existence</i>, in its most abstract form, refers to a 
supposed something, attaching alike to the object and to the subject, 
over and above Quantity, and Succession, and Co-existence, which are 
the attributes common to both. The only meaning of the word is the 
object <i>together with</i> the subject, for which addition we also 
employ the synonymous words, Universe, Being, Absolute, Totality of 
Things. To predicate <i>existence</i> of matter or mind is a pure 
tautology. <i>Existence</i> means matter, or mind, or both, as the case 
may be. The only use of the word is to express Object or Subject 
indiscriminately, there being occasions when we do not need to specify 
either."<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> Furthermore, he continues, "from the predicate 
<i>existence</i> 
there springs no science or department of logical method. Indeed
<!--
16 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p16"></a>
all propositions containing this predicate are more or less 
elliptical: when fully expressed they fall under co-existence or 
succession. When we say there exists a conspiracy for a particular 
purpose, we mean that at the present time a body of men have formed 
themselves into a society for a particular object; which is a complex 
affirmation, resolvable into propositions of co-existence and 
succession. The assertion that the dodo does not exist, points to the 
fact that this animal, once known in a certain place, has disappeared 
or become extinct, is no longer associated with the locality; all 
which may be better stated without the use of the verb exist." Instead 
of "Does ether exist?" Mr. Bain gives as the more correct form, "Are 
heat and light, and other radiant influences propagated by an ethereal 
medium diffused in space?"<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>
If, therefore, Being is taken to mean <i>existence</i>, Mr. Bain tells 
us that existence either has no meaning or it must be taken as 
synonymous with some other words less abstract in character. Mr. 
Spencer, while agreeing that we have no clear idea of abstract 
existence, yet contends that: we have, in regard to it, an <i>obscure 
consciousness</i>. "We come face to face with the ultimate difficulty 
-- how can there possibly be constituted a consciousness of the 
unformed and  
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 17
--><A NAME="p17"></a>
the unlimited, when by its very nature consciousness is possible only 
under forms and limits? Such consciousness cannot be constituted by any 
single mental act, but is the product of many mental acts. In each 
concept there is an element which persists. It is alike impossible for 
this element to be absent from this consciousness and for it to be 
present in consciousness alone; either alternative involves 
unconsciousness, the one for want of substance, the other for want of 
form. But the persistence of this element under successive conditions 
<i>necessitates</i> a sense of it as distinguished from the conditions, 
and independent of them. This consciousness is not the abstract of any 
one group of thoughts. <i>That which is common to them all and cannot 
be got rid of is what we predicate by existence</i>."<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>
In order that so prominent a body as the Kantians may not be robbed of 
due acknowledgment for the share they have had in making a regular 
puzzle of the term Being, we will quote a few words from the master 
himself. He speaks differently of <i>Thing</i> and of <i>Being</i>: for 
while he uses the latter for what is actual or existent, of the former 
he says:<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> "The one concept which <i>a priori</i> represents the 
empirical contents of phenomena is the concept of <i>Thing</i> in 
general; and the synthetical knowledge which we may have of a Thing 
<i>a priori</i> can give us nothing but the mere rule of synthesis to 
be applied to what perception may present to us <i>a posteriori</i>, 
but never an <i>a priori</i> intuition of a real 
<!--
18 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p18"></a>
object." That is, <i>Thing</i> is an <i>a priori</i>, subjective form 
of the mind in accordance with which, as a rule for our thought, we 
must think whenever we direct our minds to objects of experience; but 
we cannot assign to our notion <i>Thing</i> any corresponding reality 
beyond thought. So much for <i>Thing</i>: we append a sentence on 
<i>Being</i>, which has won for itself notoriety.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> <i>Being</i> is 
not a real predication that can be added to a concept of a Thing. It is 
merely the admission of a Thing, and of certain determinations in it. . 
. . The real does not contain more than the possible: a hundred real 
dollars do not contain a penny more than a hundred possible dollars. 
The conceived hundred dollars do not in the least increase through 
their existence, which is to be outside the mind." Here it is plain 
that Kant makes Being stand for Existence, and he distinguishes it from 
Thing, which he makes to be an <i>a priori</i> form. Our sense of Being 
will be found to make it synonymous with Thing.<p>
Not much more need be done in the way of enforcing, by examples, the 
conviction that about the notion of Being men's ideas are unsettled; 
but two instances of a simpler order may usefully be added. First, Mr. 
Matthew Arnold, whose protest it was that he was no philosopher, took 
the etymological route to the discovery of what Being means; and he 
found contrary to what Cousin had imagined, that in different languages 
the verb <i>to be</i> had borne such original concrete meanings as to 
breathe, or to grow, or to dwell, or to stand. Thus he fancied that
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 19  
--><A NAME="p19"></a>
he had taken the mystery out of the word <i>Being</i>. Next, in behalf 
of the positivist religion, Mr. Frederick Harrison had to meet the 
assertion that  collective humanity is not a Being, and therefore 
cannot become the object of a cult; he argued his case in the following 
dialogue, as P. against C.<p>
P. "What do you understand by the word Being?"<p>
C. "O, a palpable, living personality."<p>
P. "Gently, do you mean that the Deity is palpable, or that an elephant 
is not a Being?"<p>
C. "Well, then, a Being is a living organism."<p>
P. "Quite so; and what constitutes an organism in the scientific sense?"<p>
C. "O, pardon me; I make no pretensions to be a biologist. We are 
discussing religion, not Physics."<p>
P. "In other words, when you reiterate that humanity is not a Being, 
you are not very clear what a Being is. Let us see what according to 
science really constitutes an <i>Organism or Being</i>."<p>
No doubt every organism is a Being; but we can hardly make a simple 
conversion of the proposition and say, Every Being is an organism. 
What seems to have been lurking in Mr. F. Harrison's mind was, that if 
he could prove that humanity formed one organic whole he would 
establish a right to call it a Being -- a single Being; but with this 
truth he at least has put on all the appearances of mixing up something 
untrue and giving it explicit utterance, namely, that Being simply 
means organism, or is its convertible term.
<!--
20 BEING.  
--><A NAME="p20"></a><p>
We repeat that we do not wish the reader, at the present stage, to 
consider minutely what the foregoing quotations mean: their purpose is 
fully answered if they simply compel assent to the proposition, that 
Being is not a notion which everybody has clearly before his mind. We 
are going to claim rather close attention to a lengthened exposition of 
the sense which we are about to attach to Being; and in order that our 
claims might not be pooh-poohed on the score of needlessness, we have 
taken the rather painful course of inflicting on the reader a number of 
passages, which in themselves he is not likely to have found very 
entertaining. But the discipline was salutary, and let us hope that its 
purpose is gained. We now positively lay down our own account of Being.<p>
(2) <i>a</i>. Being is either actual or possible; but we will begin 
with the former, because it pre-eminently is Being, and is called by 
the schoolmen, <i>ens participii</i>, Being as the participle. For the 
force of the present participle is to signify the actual exercise of 
that which the verb means. Thus <i>intelligere</i> means to 
<i>understand</i>, and the force of <i>intelligens</i>, as a 
participle, is such that <i>homo intelligens</i> must be taken to be "a 
man in the very act of using his intelligence: " whereas <i>homo 
intelligens</i>, when <i>intelligens</i> stands as a noun-adjective, is 
the same as our "intelligent man," who is so called, though at present 
he may be asleep, or narcotized, or under temporary insanity. Again, 
when we distinguish between an agent that is hereafter to do something 
and its future <i>agency</i> or <i>causality</i>, we evidently employ 
the 
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 21 
--><A NAME="p21"></a>
former term, not as a participle, <i>agens</i>, that which is in the 
process of acting, but as a noun, that thing which has a power to act, 
whether it be now using it or not.<p>
Similarly, when we deal with Being, it might mean an actually existent 
thing; or it might mean simply whatever is capable of an existence, 
whatever presents an actualizable content, whatever is an 
<i>existible</i>; or lastly, it might mean existence in the abstract, 
as when we speak of the Being that is given to some possible essence. 
The second of these several meanings is found most eligible, when we 
want to assign Being its place as "the formal object" or special 
subject-matter of Ontology. Being, then, we do not define, for it is 
too simple a notion to admit of strict definition, but we explain it to 
mean whatever is apt to have existence, whether it have it or not. It 
is not distinctly actual Being, nor distinctly potential Being, but 
Being left neutral as to the assertion of actuality or potentiality. So 
when we say that fire explodes gunpowder, we are philosophically 
indifferent as to whether the occurrence is actually going on at the 
time of our speaking. Thus we disarm the criticism of two 
antischolastic writers, belonging to the renaissance period, Valla and 
Nizolius, who contend that <i>Res</i> "Thing," not <i>Ens</i> "Being," 
is the truly transcendental<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> term: With us <i>Being</i> and 
<i>Thing</i> are one: Being means something, somewhat, <i>Aliquid, Ein 
Etwas, Ein bestimmtes Ding</i>; it means an <i>existible</i>, that 
<!--
22 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p22"></a>
which presents a ground for actualization, whether as an individual 
object in itself, or as a part, or as a real aspect of some individual 
whole. Being so understood is called <i>Ens Essentiae</i> in contrast 
to <i>Ens Existentiae</i>; where essence is to be taken in its wider 
sense <sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> for anything that has a <i>whatness</i> or <i>quiddity</i>, 
even though this be but of the <i>accidental</i> order as opposed to 
the <i>substantial</i>.<p>
St. Thomas fully sanctions the use of the term Being in the 
signification which we have just attached to it; but of course it is 
not anything like his invariable interpretation. In some passages he 
distinguishes Being from Thing, because he is using the former 
professedly in its participial force, and therefore is obliged to make 
it convey the notion of actual existence. For example, "There is 
nothing affirmable of every Being (<i>ens</i>) except its essence 
(<i>essentia</i>): and the latter is signified by the word <i>thing 
(res)</i>, which differs from <i>Being (ens)</i> in this, that 
<i>Being</i> is a term derived from the fact of existing (<i>ab actu 
essendi</i>), while <i>thing</i> expresses the essence or 
quiddity;"<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> or again, "that is called simply a <i>Thing</i> which 
has a definite, fixed nature (<i>habet esse ratum et fixum in 
natura</i>) but it is called Being so far as it has existence."<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> He 
refers the distinction to an Arabian philosopher:<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> "According to 
Avicenna the word thing (<i>res</i>) differs from Being (<i>ens</i>) in 
that the former expresses the quiddity or essence of Being." Again, on 
the 
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 23 
--><A NAME="p23"></a>
same point he writes:<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> "While in an object we discover 
<i>quiddity</i> and <i>Being</i>, it is rather on the <i>Being</i> than 
on the <i>quiddity</i> that its truth is to be grounded." These 
passages suffice by way of acknowledgment that many places in St. 
Thomas are not to be read in the light of our present interpretation of 
Being, which is made simply with a view to settling the most convenient 
form for the primary idea in the science of Ontology.  But now to prove 
that we have the Angelic Doctor on our side in the usage which we 
adopt, let the following words testify:<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> "It is true that Being 
(<i>Ens</i>) so far as it signifies that which is apt to exist 
(<i>secundum quod importat rem cui competit esse</i>) means the essence 
of the thing." Here is just what we want. Against our determination to 
allow Being to hold itself neutral as regards actual existence, it 
might be urged that some scholastics, of whose contention we shall say 
a little, but only a little, later on, strongly uphold a real 
distinction between essence and existence in created things. But that 
this view is not brought forward by them against our present position 
will appear from such a typical writer on their side as Cardinal 
Zigliara, whose words will serve as a brief recapitulation of all that 
we have been trying to make plain:<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> "Because Being is described in 
relation to existence, that is  
<!--
24 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p24"></a>
called real Being which either has, or at least can have, an existence 
in nature. In this way we assert that the world, man, God, are real 
Beings. Being is divided into actual and possible: it is actual if it 
<i>de facto</i> exist, possible if it is only <i>in potentia</i> as 
regard existence." It is an additional pleasure to find even an 
Hegelian conceding to us, that our use of the word Being is at least 
nearly in accordance with what men commonly understand in every-day 
speech. "In the ordinary application," says Mr. Wallace,<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> "Being is 
especially employed to denote the stage of definite and limited Being; 
what we call reality. Reality is determinateness as opposed to mere 
vagueness. To be real it is necessary to be a somewhat." Hence we are 
led to the most useful remark that, according to our account of it, 
Being is. in one way a determinate idea; it has a fixed content, though 
this is the smallest possible. It contains only one note in its 
"comprehension," but it really does contain one. Therefore we say 
definitively Being means Thing. As to the logical "extension" of the 
term that is illimitably large, or, as we say, "transcendental," which 
means that instead of being confined to the bounds of one class, like 
mere universal terms, "man," "animal," "substance," it <i>passes over 
all bounds</i> and reaches to every member of every class and to every 
single thing. Philosophers have assigned various significations to 
"transcendental," but the above is our use of it in the present 
connexion.<p>
(<i>b</i>) It may allay the rising discontent of some
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 25
--><A NAME="p25"></a>
if we declare at once that the sense which we have just been assigning 
to the term Being is in part conventional. The fact that there is such 
a convention and something about its nature must now be made plain. No 
doubt there may be an inclination to refuse acquiescence in the 
arrangement because of a certain unwillingness to let the element of 
actual existence drop out of the explicit signification of Being, which 
in its primary force, as a participle of the substantive verb, asserts 
this very character of existence.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> Still we have shown that herein 
Being has only shared the common fate of its kind. Just as a 
Protestant, in these days of easy tolerance, might pass all his days 
without ever actually protesting, and yet would have claim to his title 
because his position is one that might naturally lead to a 
protestation; so a Being may never actually be, and yet deserve its 
name, because it truly presents an actualizable nature. It so presents 
itself to thought, and thus the vulgarism <i>somethink</i> for 
<i>something</i> is not altogether a useless reminder of of what many 
suppose to be a correct piece of etymology. They connect <i>thing</i> 
and <i>think</i> as <i>ding</i> and <i>denken</i>, or as <i>res</i> and 
<i>reri</i>; thing is thus a "thinkable content." But instead of 
further apologizing for those who are parties to the convention about 
Being, we must hasten to quote some documents in which they openly 
declare that the case is one for settlement by compact, not a matter 
that settles itself. It becomes a very hopeless controversy when 
<!--
26 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p26"></a>
rival disputants try to fix the signification of the terms by the 
sheer necessities of the words. Yet this is sometimes attempted. 
Suarez<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> puts the matter thus: "Being in its double acceptation does 
not stand for two divisions of a common concept, but for a greater and 
a less degree of abstraction in the formation of one idea. <i>Being as 
a noun (ens vi nominis)</i> signifies that which has a real essence, 
prescinding from the question of actual existence, not indeed so as to 
exclude or deny it, but simply abstracting from it: while <i>Being as a 
participle (ens vi Participii)</i> signifies an actual Being as 
existent, and thus it considers Being in a more restricted sense. 
Accordingly Being, as a noun, does not mean potential Being (<i>ens in 
potentia</i>), inasmuch as the latter is privatively or negatively 
opposed to actual Being; but it means Being so far as it is a real<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> 
essence, a real something. Hence Being, as a noun, may be predicated of 
God, of whom we could never predicate potential Being." After Suarez 
two or three contemporary scholastics may be quoted to show how his 
opinion is still in vogue. A Louvain professor<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> speaks of the option 
that is given to us thus: "The act of Being may mean either what a 
thing is -- its quiddity -- or that a thing is -- its existence." A 
like account is given by Father Palmieri,<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> where he teaches that 
"the proper object of Ontology is 
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 27
--><A NAME="p27"></a>
Being in the sense of essence, since Ontology considers the essences 
of things, prescinding from their actual existence." Essence is here 
employed in the broad sense of any <i>quiddity</i>, whether strictly an 
essence or only an accident, whether a concrete essence or only an 
essence generalized by abstraction; about all which matters we shall 
have to explain ourselves presently. <i>Essentia</i> as an abstract 
term means simply that which gives the <i>esse</i> of a thing, as 
<i>sapientia</i> gives the <i>sapere</i> of a wise man.<p>
It is needless to add more witnesses about the fact of a convention, 
when that fact is not disputable: but a further remark made by the 
last-quoted author raises a question. Is it, after all, between two 
quite distinct significations of the word Being that we have to choose? 
Does <i>ens existentiae</i>, Being the participle, really add a new 
note to <i>ens essentiae</i>, Being the noun? Is existence wholly a 
different idea from essence? Father Palmieri<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> thinks that this cannot 
simply be affirmed; that at least to some degree the assertion would be 
incorrect; for, says he, "though the objective concept of Being is made 
to express both essence and existence, nevertheless it is not a 
compound notion, that is, not a notion such as can be split up into 
two elements, each conceivable apart. Essence and existence cannot be 
so resolved, because the existence signified by the Being is nothing 
more than the essence itself as actualized,<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> while on the other hand 
the notion of essence always involves
<!--
28 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p28"></a>
that of existence, a possible existence implying the capability to 
exist."<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> It may be objected that the implication of one term in 
others is so widespread, that if we are to refuse to admit plurality of 
ideas on this score, we shall bring down the number of distinct ideas 
to a very small figure. This is true: but at any rate a specially close 
implication of one in the other is found between the two transcendental 
terms, essence and existence, existence being understood of both the 
mental and the actual order. In this way it is taken by Father 
Tongiorgi: "Whatever is conceived as having some reality (an essence) 
is conceived as either actually existing, or at least after the manner 
of something existing, for it is such that there is no repugnance in 
its existence. Nay, more, by the very fact of its being an object of 
thought, it has a sort of existence in the ideal order." So far from 
being a subtlety peculiar to scholasticism the above view is frequently 
expressed by authors of various schools, and even finds a place in the 
writings of a man so little scholastic as David Hume.28

Of course there is a school-boy desire, not confined to school-boys, to 
have nothing introduced into the teaching which at all complicates 
matters; and to minds thus disposed the passages just quoted will prove 
exasperating. But in study, as in many other things, our wisdom is not 
to yield to exasperation which is fatal to success, but patiently to 
grapple with a difficulty, and make, if possible, some tolerable 
compromise where perfect arrangement is impossible. There is a good 
suggestion in that title to a chapter in <i>Gil Blas: De ce que fait Gil 
Blas ne pouvant faire mieux</i> -- "What Gil Blas did when he could do 
nothing better." Now to fix upon a signification for Being as the 
subject-matter of Ontology is clearly in part a question of convention. 
And because of the extreme slipperiness of the terms, no convention 
will be absolutely as neat as we could desire; no convention will be 
even maintainable unless we are aware of the ambiguities which it has 
to provide for; and therefore in arranging the terms of a settlement we 
must direct attention to a difference, and yet a sort of identity there 
is between essence and existence, especially when both are taken as 
well in the possible as in the actual order. Besides what has already 
been 
<!--
30 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p30"></a>
pointed out, Father Palmieri calls notice to a yet further 
complication, by mentioning the fact that existence itself can be 
regarded as a kind of an object, a thing, an essence: "Ontology 
considers the essences of things, abstracting from their actual 
existence: so much so that when it comes to treat of existence, it 
regards this not as bare existence, but <i>as being itself something 
either actual or potential</i>."<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> In face of all these sources of 
perplexity we must resolutely state our free determination to make 
words have a certain force and no more. However, the two terms may pass 
over into one another, we can find a point of distinction between 
<i>that which</i> does or may exist, and the <i>existence</i> which 
does or may belong to it, or to which it does or may belong; for 
perhaps, at a stretch, we can view this matter of belonging either 
way.<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup> As a bargain, we undertake to mean by Being <i>that which</i> 
does or may exist, whether it exist or not; we commit ourselves neither 
to its actuality nor to its potentiality. When we want to say something 
about existence considered as actual or potential, and about its 
relation to <i>that which</i> does or may exist, we shall be at liberty 
to do so; but meanwhile Being for us is any <i>existible</i> -- 
whatever is capable of an 
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 31 
--><A NAME="p31"></a>
actual existence. One reason why some treatises on Ontology are 
perplexing, is that no single account of Being is made, as we are now 
making it, the basis of the system, but varieties of meaning are 
allowed to creep in, and what is said of one of these is apt to be read 
on the supposition that it is another meaning which is intended. We 
shall see presently that the principle of Excluded Middle has to be 
interpreted differently when it is of <i>ens existentiae</i>, and when 
it is of <i>ens essentia</i> that we say: <i>Quodvis aut est aut non 
est</i>, "Everything either is or is not;" and this example is only one 
among many in which it is needful to know exactly how <i>ens</i> is 
being considered.<p>
(<i>c</i>) But it may be asked, if <i>Ens Essentia</i>, or Being when 
it is not positively understood to be actual, forms the subject-matter 
of Ontology, is not the Reality of the Science in jeopardy? No, for 
first of all we have not made Being quite an empty notion: we have not 
taken away from, it, as some have done, just the one bit of content, or 
as logicians say, of "comprehension," which is proper to it, and 
without which it is left utterly vacuous, and therefore most certainly 
unreal. Mansel<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> is an offender at this point. "In the act of 
conception," he says, "when we regard some attributes as constituting 
an object, we conceive it as thereby limited, as being itself and 
nothing else. The indefinite ideas, therefore, <i>Thing, Object, 
Being</i>, are not concepts, because they contain no distinctive 
attributes, and the general object denoted by such a term is 
inconceivable."
<!--
32 BEING.  
--><A NAME="p32"></a><p>
As far as one requisite is concerned, we have secured that Being shall 
be "real:" for we have provided that it shall contain one note in its 
"comprehension." But that one note is "Thing," whether possible or 
actual: and the question arises, how can the "real" fail to include 
positively within its idea the actual? How can it leave actuality 
neutral?  We reply, in one acceptation of the word, "real" is identical 
with actual, but in our present use of it we regard reality as 
sufficiently provided for, in that things possible are such that they 
may hereafter exist and do now exist virtually in their causes. They 
are not mere creatures of the mind, nor are they creatures of the mind 
to the extent of second intentions, a phrase which needs explanation. 
In the most rigorous use of the words, they mean something, which, as 
it is regarded at a given time, is so conceived that it could not, 
under the present denomination, exist outside the mind. An object 
literally and "in first intention," is, or may be, a man or an animal, 
useful or noxious: but to be a subject or a predicate, to be one and 
the same in many separate individuals, to be a species or a genus, to 
be known, these are characters which cannot be attributed to anything, 
except in so far as it is affected by the fact of becoming an object of 
thought: no actually existent thing, as such, is subject or predicate, 
or a universal, or a species. When, however, it is said that "second 
intentions" can exist only as objects of thought, it must be observed 
that thought itself has an existence other than as an object of 
thought; it is a psychological activity of the mind,
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING 33 
--><A NAME="p33"></a>
the thought as distinguished from its object, and so far it is of 
"first intention." Now a possible Being, though it can be looked upon 
from the point of view of "a second intention," must be admitted to be 
of "first intention," inasmuch as it is an object producible by 
creative or by physical causality.<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> It has an extramental existence 
in its causes or its materials: it is possible as a fact in the 
concrete, and not merely as an object of thought, though of course this 
fact cannot be known without a mind knowing it. Its reality lies in the 
fact that it is realizable by forces, and sometimes also by materials, 
that are at present actual, and have their power of production, whether 
we think about it or not. Thus the unreal is reduced either to what is 
intrinsically impossible, or else to "second intentions,"<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup> which have 
indeed a foundation in things actual, but can never be simply actual 
things, existing outside the mind. For example, there can be no "human 
species," physically existing as a species, but there are human beings 
who can mentally be represented under the form of a species by 
abstraction from all but specific characters.<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup> We conclude, that in 
the sense assigned, the Being that Ontology deals with, at least 
primarily, is real, but it may be either actual or potential.<p>
Even yet we have not quite finished with the  
<!--
34 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p34"></a>
description of the reality which is attributable to Being. We have 
seen that it has one note, and that this note points to a real object; 
but we have yet to declare that the reality of Being is not something 
actually distinct from the concrete natures of which it is predicated, 
and that still less is the Being of all things one and the same 
throughout. We can suppose nothing to be real with a Being other than 
itself; neither can we suppose that there are any mere phenomena, or 
any phenomena which are unreal. Every genuine manifestation is a real 
manifestation, and is declarative of some real object manifested. 
Being, then, stands apart by itself only as a result of mental 
abstraction, not as a fact in the constitution of things. Again, as to 
the other point, the singleness of Being throughout all existences, 
that likewise is a doctrine quite abhorrent to our principles, though 
only too congenial to some schools of speculation. Its prevalence among 
the ancient Hindus, who were so apt to regard all sensible, perceptible 
nature as empty appearances, is ascribed by Cousin to their want of 
history, which gives dignity to passing events, to their very poor 
estimate of human kind, and to their stern theocracy which pushed to 
extremes the teaching that God is all-in-all. We have not here to refute 
any of their errors; but the absence of such errors from any system of 
ours is what we do well to insist upon.<p>
At length we have completed the sketch of our teaching on the subject 
of the Reality of Being; and the width of meaning which we have 
assigned to the term "real" will be found highly convenient 
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 35 
--><A NAME="p35"></a>
on various occasions. For instance, it keeps away from us the 
difficulty which some feel about universal propositions of the 
categorical kind. They can allow that where the "all" can be definitely 
enumerated, as when we say, "All the European sovereigns desire peace," 
the assertion is categorical:<sup><small><a name="n35"><a href="#n_35">{35}</a></a></small></sup> but they feel driven to give a 
hypothetical character to such cases as, "All triangles have the sum of 
their angles equal to two right angles;" "All men are naturally 
mortal." Here, because the "all" cannot have its constituent members 
counted or found in the order of existences, certain philosophers 
interpret the enunciations thus: "If there is a triangle, the sum of 
its angles will equal two right angles; " "if there is a man, he will 
be naturally mortal." We, on the contrary, who make reality neutral to 
actual or possible existence, and to existence past, present, or 
future, have no need to introduce any hypotheses. Other conveniences 
will be felt in the course of our treatise; to call special attention 
to them at the time will not be necessary, nor does it sound well to be 
always advertising one's wares, and pointing out how admirably they 
serve their purpose.<p>
(3) Occasionally we find Being called the highest genus, but according 
to the schoolmen it is not a genus at all. It is true that Cajetan and 
Scotus do not quite agree with the more ordinary account of how it is 
that the generalized notion Being is reduced, by the appendage to it of 
particular marks, to the idea of determinate Being; but the doctrine of 
<!--
36 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p36"></a>
Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n36"><a href="#n_36">{36}</a></a></small></sup> is against calling this particularization a descent from 
genus to species. Commenting on the subject, St. Thomas says:<sup><small><a name="n37"><a href="#n_37">{37}</a></a></small></sup> "The 
philosopher shows that Being cannot stand as a genus; for a genus has 
dtfferences which are outside its own essence: but no difference can be 
found outside Being, for not-Being does not constitute a difference." 
The argument is that a genus must be narrowed down to a species by some 
idea, such that neither of the two ideas contains the other as its 
intrinsic and formal constituent. Thus let us suppose, without dispute 
as to facts, and simply by way of illustration, that the generic term 
animal means a sensitive organism, and that the specific term rational 
means a spiritual intelligence acting, not on intuition alone, but by 
ratiocination -- by "discourse of reason." It is clear that the generic 
notion here does not include the specific in its "comprehension," for 
there may be animals that are not rational. And, on the other hand, 
"rational" does not explicitly contain within its "comprehension" the 
meaning of "animal." For though it may perhaps be that rationality, as 
above defined, can go only with animality, still, "using discourse of 
reason" makes no open mention of "having a sensitive organism."<p>
Unfortunately for the simplicity of our procedure, the scholastics are 
not clear beyond confusion in working out the idea of Aristotle. St. 
Thomas argues from the point of view that "no difference can be
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 37 
--><A NAME="p37"></a>
found outside being;" Carleton says that the differences of Being are 
outside Being; Father Lahousse<sup><small><a name="n38"><a href="#n_38">{38}</a></a></small></sup> repeats the doctrine, making the 
obvious distinction between "comprehension" and "extension." His view 
is, that while the differences of Being include Being in their 
"comprehension," but not in their "extension," Being, on the contrary, 
includes its differences in "extension" but not in "comprehension." In 
other words, while you can say that substance, spirit, matter, have 
Being as one note within the compass of their meaning, you cannot say 
that Being, as such, is substance, or spirit, or matter, because Being, 
as such, need not be any particular one of these; on the other hand, 
Substance, or Spirit, or Matter is Being, but Being does not contain 
within its meaning Substance, or Spirit, or Matter. Now this last part 
of the assertion, that Being does not contain within its 
"comprehension" Substance, or Spirit, or Matter, is obvious if we take 
the term in its clear explicit meaning; but if we consider its obscure, 
implicit meaning, then it almost seems as though some authors supposed 
a sort of inclusion in Being of any difference applicable to it in any 
particular case. This fact will come out more luminously when, as we 
shall immediately proceed to do, we take up the subject of the 
analogousness of Being: at present a single specimen of the style of 
treatment to which we refer will suffice. It is found in the words of 
Father Palmieri:<sup><small><a name="n39"><a href="#n_39">{39}</a></a></small></sup> "The real modes of Being are Being itself, so that 
in those objects which are ranked under the head of Being, <i>there is no 
note 
<!--
38 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p38"></a>
other than that of Being</i>, but only Being in some particular mode 
of its existence." But, of course, he may explain, that it is the 
differences which "comprehend" Being, and not vice versa.<p>
The question may seem a subtle one, but it is not really difficult. 
Some authors want to show cause why they should not regard Being as 
they regard an ordinary generic notion. They appeal to the fact, that 
whatever other case be brought forward as parallel to Being and its 
convertible terms, will be found, on examination, to be not quite 
parallel. Thus the disparity appears if we compare Being to that which 
comes nearest to it, namely, one of the highest genera, Substance.<sup><small><a name="n40"><a href="#n_40">{40}</a></a></small></sup>
Comparing the phrases, "Animal Being," "Rational Being," with "Animal 
Substance," "Rational Substance," we observe that Being, in its 
abstract form, can be predicated of the abstract forms which are 
derivable from its differentiating adjectives, while substance, in its 
abstract form, cannot so well be predicated of the abstract forms which 
are derivable from its differentiating adjectives. We may say, 
"Animality is Entity," "Rationality is Entity," more conveniently than 
we can say, "Animality is Substantiality," " Rationality is 
Substantiality." The discrimination becomes more obvious when we take 
something less universal than a highest genus. Starting from "Rational 
Being," and "Rational Animal," we may write, "Rationality is Being," 
but not "Rationality is Animality." The root of the doctrine lies in 
the more usual teaching of the scholastics, against Cajetan and Scotus, 
to 
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 39 
--><A NAME="p39"></a>
the effect that the unlimited generality of Being is contracted to 
successively narrower and narrower spheres, not by the addition of 
ideas other than that of Being -- not as "animal" is contracted by the 
addition of "rational" -- but by a fuller expression of the same idea.<p>
We are at once launched on that difficult sea of controversy which 
rages about the analogousness of Being -- of Being, let us remember, 
taken as <i>ens essentiae</i>. What analogy means is illustrated by the 
remark of Sydney Smith, which puzzled a very matter-of-fact Scotchman
-- the remark, namely, that a certain book was <i>healthy</i>. Clear, 
however, as this illustration may be, it leaves us under need of 
further explanation, which we enter upon with the observation that an 
object, an idea, and a word, as a matter of usage, may each be called 
by the epithet <i>univocal</i>. Most appropriately objects would be 
denominated by this epithet, for it is to objects that words 
(<i>voces</i> ) are primarily applied: but ideas and words have 
established for themselves a share in the title. A <i>univocal</i> 
term, strictly so called, must apply to several objects the same 
notion, without variation of meaning; a condition of things which can 
be attained only by mentally prescinding from all differences in the 
objects. Thus if by "animal" we agree to mean absolutely no more than 
"sensitively-organized Being," in complete disregard of variations in 
the perfection of the organism or the sensitiveness, and if by 
"rational" we agree to mean absolutely no more than "intelligence that 
works discursively," then these terms, because we have effectively 
willed 
<!--
40 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p40"></a>
to make them so, are each univocal when applied to their respective 
objects. The only dispute that could arise on the point, would be a 
biological or a psychological one -- whether our definitions are valid. 
But supposing their validity, then we have, at least under an 
hypothesis, instances of what is meant by univocal. We have one term 
applied to a plurality of objects without change of signification. Thus 
it appears that the power of making <i>univocal</i> terms depends on 
the power of prescinding from all the differences that exist between a 
multiplicity of similar things, and of regarding them only so far as 
they are alike. If, therefore, Being is of such a peculiar character 
that we cannot perfectly prescind, or prefer not fully to prescind, 
from its differences, then the term becomes, instead of <i>univocal, 
analogous</i>, that is, a term <i>which in name is identical throughout 
its applications, but in meaning is partly the same and partly 
different</i>. Thus a man, his food, and his book may all be healthy, 
but with a variation in the applicability of the term. Not to dwell at 
present on the several sorts of analogy, we will ask at once, does 
Being refuse to allow us fully to prescind it from its differences? 
Many authors, resting upon reasons already given for denying that Being 
is generic, deny also that it is univocal. Their argument often comes 
ultimately to the plea that fully to prescind from differences is, in 
the case of Being, impossible or unadvisable. Carleton<sup><small><a name="n41"><a href="#n_41">{41}</a></a></small></sup> expressly 
relies upon the impossibility. Suarez<sup><small><a name="n42"><a href="#n_42">{42}</a></a></small></sup> is unsatisfactory in his 
defence of the analogousness of the term, because, though at times
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 41 
--><A NAME="p41"></a>
he seems to argue from the transcendentality of Being, and from the 
impossibility of fully prescinding Being from its differences, 
nevertheless at other times he implies that he has a better and more 
radical argument. Authors on the same side as Suarez also cause some 
perplexity by speaking now as though any of the varieties of Being at 
pleasure were, in some way, included under "the comprehension" of 
Being, now as though they were rather under its "extension" only.<p>
By way of specimen Suarez shall be cited. "Being," he contends, 
"however abstractedly taken, of its own nature implies this order, that 
it belongs primarily and of itself (<i>primo et per se</i>), to God." 
Thus, <i>within the limits of the very notion of Being</i>, a 
hierarchical character is said to declare itself. Being, as it were, 
asserts of itself that it must be primarily independent, infinite and 
divine, and can be only secondarily dependent, finite, and mundane. The 
author sets forth these thoughts as follows: "God, by the very fact 
that He is a Being, perfectly simple in His essence and infinite, 
necessarily has in Himself the perfection of all Being in the form of a 
single, incomprehensible perfection. Hence the notion itself of Being, 
as found in God, includes the notion of substance, of wisdom, of 
justice, and therefore -- which is the main point -- God's Being is 
very Being itself, underived and independent; while on the other hand, 
in any creature, Being is wholly derived, dependent, and limited to 
some particular sort of perfection. Therefore in God Being has its 
essential plenitude, 
<!--
42 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p42"></a>
but in creatures it is only participated, or communicated in measure: 
God is one single perfection, involving the fulness of Being; but other 
Beings are only partial, dividing among themselves different finite 
perfections." Hereupon Suarez puts to himself a fair difficulty, which 
he does not answer with as much clearness as might be desired. He asks 
whether, instead of considering Being as Being in the above argument, 
he has not been considering Being as respectively first primitive and 
then derivative, first finite and then infinite. Unless he again falls 
back upon the transcendentality of Being, or the impossibility of 
perfectly prescinding in its regard, it is not so evident how he 
completely satisfies the Scotist question, "Why do you not prescind 
from every difference of Being?" Should he reply, transcendentality 
forbids, his argument would be easily understood. As a matter of fact 
he does fall back upon transcendentality,<sup><small><a name="n43"><a href="#n_43">{43}</a></a></small></sup> but he does not make it 
his chief support; he intimates that he can do without it, and even 
implies that he regards another line of proof as more important. For 
after having proved that the transcendental<sup><small><a name="n44"><a href="#n_44">{44}</a></a></small></sup> "notion of Being is 
intimately included in all the specialized notions of Being," he 
signifies that he has another argument, more radical, in store. 
"Secondly, <i>what goes most to the root of the matter (deinde quod ad 
rem maxime spectat)</i>, the general notion of Being itself, and as 
such, demands the idea of subordination 
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 43 
--><A NAME="p43"></a>
between entities." His mind perhaps may be expressed somewhat in this 
way: I will forego the direct appeal to the transcendentality of Being, 
for I have another resource. When I am inquiring whether a term is 
univocal or analogous, I must consider the special applications that 
are to be made of it; for it is idle to ask me, without further 
circumstances, if healthy and smiling are univocal terms; they may be 
applied univocally to several men, or analogously to men and countries 
in common. So with regard to Being, I must examine its applications 
before I pronounce it univocal or analogous. As unapplied it is neither 
univocal nor analogous, but taken, as logicians say, in "absolute 
supposition." When I consider the broadest division into Infinite Being 
and finite beings, I observe an order of dependence constituted within 
the very notion of Being itself. For "Being of itself essentially 
demands this order," that the finite can be only by descent from the 
infinite; thus the one differs in perfection from the other, and the 
differences are constituted by the very Being of each, not by something 
that is not formally Being. I can apply the same argument to another 
broad division of Being into substantial and accidental.<sup><small><a name="n45"><a href="#n_45">{45}</a></a></small></sup> I 
conclude, on the whole, that from the application of the idea Being to 
its different objects, it is made apparent that the term is predicated 
of them with differences in the application, in other words, it is 
analogous.<p>
The position may, perhaps, be illustrated thus.
<!--
44 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p44"></a>
On the hypothesis of creation, and on the not extravagant assumption 
that the ascending scale in animal life is not of metaphysical 
necessity, we may say that the actual gradation is not involved in the 
mere notion of "animal." There might have been an animal creation 
without our present gradations, or even without any gradations 
whatever. Whereas in the case of Being, Suarez wsuld maintain that its 
gradational order is involved in the very notion; Being <i>a se et per 
se</i>, Being <i>per se sed non a se</i>, Being <i>nec a se nec per 
se</i>; that is, Uncreated Substance, Created Substance, Accidental 
Being -- this order is required by the very nature of Being. You might 
have had man produced alone without a single other specimen of the 
animal kingdom: but you cannot have finite Being if you have not the 
Infinite, nor accidental Being if you have not the substantial, and 
that from the very nature of Being.<p>
Suarez seems quite unconvincing to the Scotists because he does not 
give a reason satisfactory to them, for arguing about Being as Infinite 
and as finite, when he professes to be arguing about Being as such -- 
the famous <i>Ens qua tale, Ens ut sic</i>. If he urges, as sometimes 
he does, that Being enters into all differences and is affected by 
them, so that this its universal sympathy, so to speak, is perpetually 
modifying its mode of application, then he is convicted of want of 
consistent loyalty to his own principle, by allowing that Being can be 
predicated univocally of things specifically the same<sup><small><a name="n46"><a href="#n_46">{46}</a></a></small></sup> For if Being is 
affected by <i>all</i> differences, it is affected by
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING 45 
--><A NAME="p45"></a>
the difference between any one individual and another of the same 
species: therefore of no two individuals can it be predicated 
univocally.<p>
On the other side of the question, the Scotists resolutely maintain 
that by disregarding all differences they can, because they will it, 
view Being as one unvarying notion throughout its applications. For as 
the ordinary mathematician regards a line simply under the aspect of 
direction in length, to the utter ignoring of breadth, and as the 
ordinary schoolman regards "animal" simply under the aspect of 
"sensitive organism," to the utter ignoring of variations in structure 
and function: so the Scotist claims to consider Being without regard to 
any of its variations.<p>
In order that the reader may have some definite teaching on a matter 
apparently so perplexing, we venture to offer the following 
propositions as safe.<p>
(a) Two grounds on which many philosophers argue for the analogy of 
Being, namely, the completeness of the dependency of finite Being on 
Infinite, and of accidental Being on substantial, are very important: 
nor are they questioned by the Scotists.<p>
(b) The differences of conclusion which Scotists and anti-Scotists 
respectively draw from these grounds about the propriety of calling 
Being analogous, are nothing like so momentous as would be a difference 
about the grounds themselves.<p>
(c) Those who call Being analogous can give a valid meaning to their 
words.<p>
The stress of the conflict evidently falls on Being 
<!--
46 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p46"></a>
as applied to God and to creatures: and here the analogists imperil 
their position if they do not cling tenaciously to the proposition 
which Dr. Dupont<sup><small><a name="n47"><a href="#n_47">{47}</a></a></small></sup> has thus formulated: "When we call God Being 
<i>per se</i>, and creatures Beings by participation, we do not wish to 
express what are properly styled specific differences, which would have 
to be conceived as additions to the notion Being; but we mean different 
modes of Being." The phrase "Beings by participation," leads to a final 
remark on this subject, and an important one too, as directed against 
pantheism. Creatures are not one Being with God, and in that sense 
Beings by participation. To emphasize this fact many writers call the 
analogy of Being an analogy of "intrinsic attribution." The gist of 
what they wish to express is, that created Beings are intrinsically 
Beings and are not called so simply by reference extrinsically to the 
Divine Being, as food is called healthy, not because intrinsically it 
is so, but because it conduces to health in man. The latter analogy is 
said to be of "extrinsic attribution;" healthy is attributed to food 
because of a health which is outside the food itself, and within man 
who eats the food<sup><small><a name="n48"><a href="#n_48">{48}</a></a></small></sup><p>
(4) After having laid down the terms of settlement as regards the 
meaning to be attached to the word Being, there remains a little to be 
said on three
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING 47 
--><A NAME="p47"></a>
self-evident principles wnich spring straight from the notion itself. 
We will not pause to engage in the not very profitable controversies as 
to whether the principle of contradiction is prior to that of identity; 
whether we should distinguish priority of apprehension from priority of 
judgment; whether the principle of identity is too tautological to be 
called a principle at all,<sup><small><a name="n49"><a href="#n_49">{49}</a></a></small></sup> and so forth. It is enough to say that 
positive perception is more directly matter of experience than 
perception of a negative, but that at the same time, every positive 
perception implies the perception of some negation. Hence our plan will 
be to regard the principle of identity as included in that of 
contradiction; we make one complete principle of the two. In tabular 
form we may arrange the three thus, so as to show the union of No. 1 
and No. 2.<p>
<pre>
    /          / What is,
   /        1 {    is,
2 {            \
   \                   and cannot
    \          at the same time not be.
             / Between Being and not-Being
          3 {      there is no medium.
             \
</pre><p>
Thus No. 2 includes No. 1, as part of itself.<p>
In testing these principles it is requisite to reduce examples to the 
simple form contemplated in books of philosophy; for of course in a 
complex 
<!--
48 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p48"></a>
case there is a mean between mere <i>is</i> and <i>is not</i>, 
<i>yes</i> and <i>no</i>; a distinction is often needed. With this 
proviso we go on to remark that in Pure Logic the principles are 
formulated for Affirmation and Negation; in Applied Logic these laws of 
affirmation and negation are shown, notwithstanding Mill's scepticism, 
to be valid also for things themselves; and in Ontology we must do what 
most people neglect to do, we must accommodate the principles to our 
own chosen sense of the word Being. Herein many fail; they assign a 
fixed meaning to a term and then, under pressure of convenience, or in 
a fit of forgetfulness, they depart from their own arrangement. We 
agreed to consider Being as <i>Ens Essentiae</i>, as standing for a 
somewhat whether existent or not: therefore if now we explain the 
principles drawn from Being only in reference to Existence, we are 
changing our plan illegitimately. Many a person who could readily 
expound the principle of Excluded Middle in relation to existence, 
would be puzzled to know what it means in relation to essence. The 
principles, or better, the Principle of Identity and Contradiction, 
therefore, must now take this shape: "To be a thing is to be a thing, 
and not to be a nothing: to be any definite thing is to be that 
definite thing and not something else." The principle of Excluded 
Middle is less obvious: "Between being a thing and not being a thing, 
between being any definite thing and not being that definite thing, 
there is no medium." If we take the form often given, <i>Quaevis res 
aut est aut non est</i> -- "Every thing or essence either is or is 
not," we must 
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING 49 
--><A NAME="p49"></a>
be careful lest we make the second alternative always an absurdity. 
For if we take the principle in regard not to existence but to essence, 
where is the sense in the alternative that an essence may not be, that 
is, may not be an essence? If we insist on finding a meaning under 
these circumstances, we can find one that will meet Mill's difficulty 
when he indulges in the supposition that the word may be unmeaning; 
"Abracadabra either is or is not." We answer that the hypothesis of 
Abracadabra without a meaning is against the previous hypothesis, that 
the principle is applied only to Being, for Being, as we shall show 
presently, must be true; but if we want to take up Mill's supposition, 
then we interpret his proposition thus: "Every <i>suggested</i> Essence 
either really is one or not:" "Every proposal of a Being either 
satisfies the requirement of a Being or not:" "Whatever is brought 
forward as something apt to exist, either really is so apt or not." As 
we shall see later, certain conditions are necessary to make a thing a 
thing, that is, an intrinsic possibility.<p>
Lest we should be supposed to misrepresent Mill by the assertion, that 
he does not regard the three primary principles as applicable to things 
in themselves, we will mention here the single exception which he 
himself makes, and which does not stand for much, when we take into 
account his inconsistency in allowing that he can validly make even a 
single proposition about Noumena. "The only contradictory alternative," 
he says,<sup><small><a name="n50"><a href="#n_50">{50}</a></a></small></sup> "of which 
<!--
50 BEING 
--><A NAME="p50"></a>
the negative side contains nothing positive, is that between Entity 
and non-Entity, Existing and non-Existing; and so far as regards that 
distinction I admit the law of Excluded Middle as applicable to 
Noumena; they must either exist or not exist. But this is all the 
applicability I can allow to it." We should be sorry to rob Mill of as 
much credit as is due to him, for having more or less seen that things 
in themselves either do exist or do not; it is not always that he is 
ready with such concessions to common sense.<p>
It has already been remarked that examples must be properly simplified 
before they can be used as illustrations of the three primary 
principles. As the last of the three is most open to misconception we 
will exemplify it in the proposition, "All cows either are or are not 
red." What must we do with the cows that are red and white, or those 
the colour of which is not simple red but a tint of red? We must fix 
upon an exact description of a red cow; and say, for instance, that a 
red cow is a cow presenting a colour that is at least predominantly 
red, and having that colour without patches of other colour 
interspersed. Then supposing the physical difficulties of verifying 
such a definition to be overcome, we are left with the safe 
metaphysical truth, that every cow either satisfies all our 
requirements or does not. To satisfy them only partially is failure. 
Hegelians, of course, object to these rigid distinctions between either 
and or: we ourselves admit how difficult they are to establish in the 
complicated cases of experience; 
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 51 
--><A NAME="p51"></a>
but we cannot therefore allow the Hegelian doctrine that, everything 
merges into its opposite, and that Reason takes up and reconciles the 
contradictions of the Understanding, by a process wherein "finite 
categories or formulae of thought work their own dissolution and pass 
over into the opposite categories."<sup><small><a name="n51"><a href="#n_51">{51}</a></a></small></sup> As a mystery guaranteed to us by 
revelation, we may believe that the God whom natural intelligence 
discovers to be One God considered absolutely in His Essence, is yet, 
when considered relatively in His Personality, three Persons; but 
revelation itself could not make us believe what defies rational 
belief, namely, that one God was at the same time, and under the same 
aspect, both one God and three Gods.<p>
At the conclusion of the chapter on Being, the remark is worth making 
that to Being, as here expounded, stands opposed what the scholastics 
call <i>nihil positivum</i>, that which positively is a non-entity, or 
presents intrinsic contradiction so as to defy actualization; not 
<i>nihil privativum</i>, which means an entity that has not indeed been 
brought into existence but might be made to exist.<sup><small><a name="n52"><a href="#n_52">{52}</a></a></small></sup>

NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.<p>
(1) The practice, so much in vogue now-a-days, of appending notes and 
illustrations to philosophical dissertations has for its chief purpose 
to be suggestive, to give some glimpses into varieties of thought, to 
show some of the surroundings that really do lie about the path which 
author and reader have been mainly intent on following, though it would 
have been a distraction to have taken express notice of them before. 
The aim, then, is not to describe whole systems, nor to give complete 
historic sketches, nor to form a continuous line of thought from one 
note to another; but to gather a few appropriate fragments here and 
there, and put them by the side of a continuous chapter, to illustrate 
different parts of its contents.<p>
In the case of Being, he is a poor sort of philosopher who does not 
care to know anything about the vast amount of human speculation which, 
in all ages, has been devoted to that notion. It is hopeless to follow 
many of the wild flights of imagination in pursuit of the supposed 
transformations of Being; Oriental dreams before the coming of Christ, 
and Gnostic fancies shortly after His coming, are specimens of what we 
mean. The Greeks, who were characteristically a clear-headed race,<sup><small><a name="n53"><a href="#n_53">{53}</a></a></small></sup> did 
not escape the fascination of Being and its dangers; for while the 
Eleatics held that immutable Being was everything, and that Change or 
Becoming were unrealities, Heraclitus fell into the opposite extreme, 
teaching, or at least seeming to teach, that there was no fixed Being, 
but only perpetual flux. His words are notorious  --
<b>panta hrei kai ouden menei, ouden mallon to on to m&ecirc;
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 53  
--><A NAME="p53"></a>
ontos esti</b>. Both these errors are perpetuated to the present day, 
when we find men speaking of phenomena as idle shows without reality, 
which give no indications of things in themselves; and when we find 
them so possessed with the idea of ceaseless evolution, that they place 
<i>Becoming</i> before <i>Being</i> in the order of important ideas. It 
has even been said that, as <i>Being</i> was the leading idea of an age 
that believed in fixity of species, so <i>Becoming</i> has grown to be 
the leading idea of an age that believes in endless transformations. 
Such is the change of the <i>Zeit-Geist</i>, or Spirit of the age, if 
indeed a certain class of people are not too self-asserting in their 
claim to represent the age.<p>
(2) Hegel's identification of Being with Nothing is so notorious, that 
some interest should naturally arise to see how he describes this Being 
of his. Being, then, is not a notion, but it is the beginning of 
thought. "When we begin to think we have nothing but thought in its 
merest indeterminateness and absence of specialization."<sup><small><a name="n54"><a href="#n_54">{54}</a></a></small></sup> Such 
indeterminateness is not derived by abstracting from previous 
determinations; it is "original and underived indeterminateness, which 
is previous to all definite character, and is the very first of all. It 
is not something felt or perceived by the spiritual sense, or pictured 
in imagination; it is only and merely thought, and as such it forms the 
beginning." Impossible as such a feat may seem, Chalyb&auml;us is said 
to have given a popular exposition of Hegel's doctrines; so from the 
<i>popular</i> account we will borrow the following description of 
Being:<sup><small><a name="n55"><a href="#n_55">{55}</a></a></small></sup> "First of all let us ask, wherein consists this Being, or 
what do we perceive in it? We can only say that as yet we do not 
distinguish anything in it 
<!--
54 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p54"></a>
nay more, that we are not even capable of distinguishing it from empty 
and pure nought. . . . Being is the pure want of determination, it is 
thinking which thinks nothing, it is intuition which looks straight 
before it, without perceiving anything; it is just as if we were 
staring into the sky, of which we could not even say that it was blue, 
or that it was not the earth, or that it was not ourselves." One use of 
this description of Being will be to bring out, by contrast, the fact 
that with us Being is a concept, that it has an objective meaning, and 
that it is the very opposite of Nothing. Even Hegel adds that along 
with the assertion that Being is identical with Nothing, we must take 
the equally true assertion that it is not identical with Nothing; else 
we shall be one-sided in our view. The great means for reconciling this 
and all other contradictions is the famous "dialectic process" which is 
at work in the constitution at once of thought and of things, for both 
meet in one identity. By the dialectic process is meant<sup><small><a name="n56"><a href="#n_56">{56}</a></a></small></sup> "an indwelling 
tendency outward and beyond, by which the one-sidedness and the 
limitation of the formulae of the understanding are seen in their true 
light and shown to be the negation of these formulae. Things are 
infinite just because they involve their own dissolution. Thus 
understood, Dialectic is discovered to be the life and soul of 
scientific progress, the dynamic which alone gives an immanent 
connexion and necessity to the subject-matter of science; and in a word 
is seen to constitute the real and true, as opposed to the external 
exaltation above the finite. Wherever there is movement, wherever 
there is life, wherever anything is carried into effect in the actual 
world, there Dialectic is at work. It is also the soul of all knowl<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 55 
--><A NAME="p55"></a>ledge which is truly scientific. . . . The limitations of the 
finite do not come merely from without; its own nature is the cause of 
its abrogation, and by its own means it passes into its counterpart. . 
. . Everything that surrounds us may be viewed as an instance of 
Dialectic. We are aware that everything finite, instead of being 
inflexible and ultimate, is rather changeable and transient; and this 
is exactly what we mean by that Dialectic of the finite, by which the 
finite as implicitly other than what it is, is forced to surrender its 
own immediate or natural Being, and to turn suddenly into its opposite. 
All things finite, it is said, meet their doom; and in saying so we 
have a perception that Dialectic is the universal and irresistible 
power before which nothing can stay, however secure and stable it may 
deem itself. . . . Take as an illustration the motion of the heavenly 
bodies. At this moment the planet stands at this spot, but implicitly 
it is the possibility of being in another spot; and that possibility of 
being otherwise the planet brings into existence by moving. A Dialectic 
is recognized in the common proverbs, <i>Summum jus, summa injuria</i> 
-- 'Pride goes before a fall;' 'Too much wit out-wits itself.'" The 
"Dialectic process" if watered down to mean some such truths as are 
often set forth in discoursing on texts like, "Extremes meet," "The 
knowledge of opposites is one," "Too far East is West," might be 
acceptable; but in the undiluted form it gets into the heads of 
Hegelians and drives them to all sorts of extravagant utterances.<p>
(3) Should it be said that the identification of something with 
nothing, or at least the assertion of the nothingness of all created 
things is sanctioned by the Fathers of the Church, unless indeed we put 
the still worse interpretation on their words, that they make out 
<!--
56 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p56"></a>
God to be nothing; we reply that they expressly teach the opposite, 
and that the passages in which they might seem inclining to the errors 
in question admit of easy reconciliation with the truth. The fact is, 
that in their desire to bring out the immense difference between 
Uncreated and Created Being, they affirm on the one side that the 
latter is a comparative nothing,<sup><small><a name="n57"><a href="#n_57">{57}</a></a></small></sup> and on the other side that our 
predicates, derived from finite experiences, may he denied in regard to 
the God whom they so inadequately represent. But Scotus Erigena clearly 
overstrains this style of phraseology. The following are a few specimen 
utterances of his: "No category can properly include God in its 
signification;" "God is above all form, and is therefore rather no form 
than form;" "As the Divine Goodness is beyond comprehension, it is 
called, <i>per excellentiam</i>, Nothing;" "God is beyond Being, and is 
in General beyond the utterable and the intelligible;" "The Divine 
ignorance stands for nothing else than the infinite and 
incomprehensible Wisdom of God." Such modes of speech cannot be 
recommended; it being, for example, a very poor reason why God's wisdom 
should be called ignorance because it is at the furthest possible 
remove from ignorance and high above all that passes for wisdom among 
men. Yet on the Scotist model Nicholas de Cusa calls our highest wisdom 
<i>docta ignorantia</i>: in God he finds all affirmations and negations 
reconciled.<p>
(4) While treating of Being as not a generic and not a univocal notion, 
we mentioned Carleton as one who holds that Being does not include, 
within its "comprehension," its own differences. His words may usefully 
be given:<sup><small><a name="n58"><a href="#n_58">{58}</a></a></small></sup> "The very fact that we have Being narrowed down to some 
special form (<i>ens contractum</i>) 
<!--
THE NOTION OF BEING. 57 
--><A NAME="p57"></a>
implies that there is some other concept <i>outside the concept of 
Being</i>, though Being does not lie outside the concept of it. 
Therefore Being is abstracted from the differences of Being with only 
the incomplete abstraction known as that of the Including and the 
Included." While, however, some thus deny that more determinate ideas 
come under the "comprehension" of Being, others might suppose, that 
because of the peculiar nature of the term, Being does, after a manner, 
hold all other ideas even in its "comprehension," though not of course 
explicitly. In this light, rightly or wrongly, they might read such 
passages of St. Thomas as these: "There can be no differentiating note 
which is outside the concept of Being;"<sup><small><a name="n59"><a href="#n_59">{59}</a></a></small></sup> "To Being nothing can be 
added as of a nature extrinsic to it, in the way in which a specific 
difference is added to a genus, or an accident to a subject. For every 
nature is, by its very essence, Being; and only in so far can anything 
be called additional to Being as it expresses the manner of Being, 
which is not expressed by the word itself."<sup><small><a name="n60"><a href="#n_60">{60}</a></a></small></sup> And once more, "an 
addition may be made to Being inasmuch as the term is brought down to 
its particular conditions (<i>contrahitur</i>) by means of the ten 
highest <i>genera</i>. But what these add to Being is not some 
accident, nor some specific difference outside the essence of Being, 
but a determinate mode of Being which is founded in the very Essence of 
the thing." The conciliation of opinions seems possible, since they are 
settlements of usage that are in dispute rather than truths themselves. 
Carleton is quite right in the assertion, "that the differences of 
Being cannot at all be conceived apart from Being. while Being can he 
conceived apart from its differences;" and that so far the differences 
lie
<!--
58 BEING. 
--><A NAME="p58"></a>
outside the concept of Being. On the other hand, all these differences 
are themselves Being after a manner in which no generic notion can be 
predicated of its specific differences.<p>
(5) This is not the treatise in which to discuss innate ideas; nor are 
these much in favour among philosophers at present, unless they be 
reduced to the category of the hereditary effects of habitual 
experience; but we may mention that Being is specially the idea which 
is supposed to defy our means of acquiring notions for ourselves. Hence 
Mr. Veitch says that we have "the notion of existence <i>a priori</i>," 
and that "if we are only conscious of an object as we apprehend it, and 
only apprehend it as we affirm it to exist, then existence must be 
attributed to the object by the mind; and this could not be done unless 
existence, as a notion, virtually pre-existed in the mind." The idea of 
Being, such as we have described it, is quite within the reacb of man's 
ordinary means of acquiring knowledge.<p>

(<i>Treatise</i> Pt. I. Bk. II. s. vi.) Similarly Locke: "Existence and 
unity are two ideas that are suggested to the understanding by every 
object without and by every idea within. When ideas are in our mind we 
consider them as being actually there." (Bk. II. c. vii. 5. 7.) The 
partially Hegelian author, Mr. F. Bradley, writes: "Whenever we 
predicate we predicate about something which exists beyond the 
judgment, and which, of whatever kind it may be, is real either inside 
of our heads or outside of them. And thus it always stands for exists." 
Mr. M'Cosh says:" In all knowledge we know what we know as <i>having 
existence, which is Being</i>." In the Hamiltonian school Prof. Veitch 
says: "Whatsoever is thought is thought under the attribute of 
existence." Finally a Louvain professor, Dr. Dupont, tells us: "Being 
signifies (a) what exists, (b) what has some reality. The two meanings 
though distinct are inseparable. For nothing can exist without having a 
determinate reality, and we cannot conceive any essence which does not 
appertain to some existent Being. whether in the, order of facts or in 
the order of mental conceptions. In thinking of a possible essence we 
think of it as it would be if it existed." (<i>Ontologie</i>. p. 35.)<p>
<a name="n_29"><a href="#n29">{29}</a></a> L.c.<p>
<a name="n_30"><a href="#n30">{30}</a></a> Our way of settling the oft-disputed point whether 
<i>existence</i> can be treated as a real attribute, is straightway to 
make it one. "Of the Eiffel Tower, I predicate that it really exists." 
All the same it is quite a peculiar attribute, and an attribute in the 
wider sense of the term. For strictly attribute is used by the 
scholastics to signify something over and above what is essential to 
the subject.<p>

<a name="n_48"><a href="#n48">{48}</a></a> We omit to consider the case of those who assert more than one term 
Being, e.g. an <i>ens confusum</i>, an <i>ens distinctum</i>, and an 
<i>ens medium</i>. Cf. 
Fonseca, in Lib. IV. <i>Metaphys.</i>. c. ii. q. ii. Suarez also speaks of an 
<i>ens confusissimum</i>. Disp. xxviii. sect. iii. n. 16.<p>

the fact, that a most powerful discourse might be delivered to enforce 
the text from Bishop Butler: "Things are what they are, and the 
consequences of them will be what they will be." How many lives are 
passed in ignoring this truth!<p>

arrival at conception of Nothing through the idea of Thing and its 
negation. "Take the idea of Reality, I could not admit that in thought 
all our ideas are qualified by their negations; I should doubt if the 
highest term we arrive at can be said to have an opposite even in 
thought, although by an error we are given to think so." (<i>Principles 
of Logic</i>, p. 548.)<p>
