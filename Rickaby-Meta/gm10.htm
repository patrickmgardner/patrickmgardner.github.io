(1) WE are now about to enter upon questions on which once more 
differences of theory about the origin of knowledge make themselves 
very conspicuously felt. To the pure empiricist, Relation, Space, and 
Time are ideas that result from complex conditions of sensation; to the 
Kantian they are <i>a priori</i> forms; to us they are general ideas 
which have a foundation in experience, but are generalized only by the 
abstracting intellect.<p>
We will begin with our English empirics. To the mind that loves 
concrete images, and does not see the need of any subtler inquiries, 
the Aristotelian treatment of Relation, Space, and Time seems 
singularly obscure in contrast to the plain handling of the subject by 
Brown, who gives us a vivid picture of an infant brandishing its little 
arms and kicking about its little legs in Space and Time. It  
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 353 
--><A NAME="p353"></a> 
thus acquires feelings of relation; and the feeling of the relations 
of co-existence give the notion of Space, while the feelings of the 
relations of succession give the notion of Time.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup><p>
And yet we have but to read on a little, and we shall find the plain 
terms of the empirical school giving place to obscurities on each of 
the three ideas which we want to investigate. Each becomes matter of 
controversy, and this fact it is well to bring out, for the benefit of 
those who fancy that the experience philosophy has made quite plain 
what centuries of scholasticism only involved in deeper and deeper 
obscurity. As to the first, Brown himself<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> draws a distinction 
between "feelings which arise in simple succession, without involving 
any notion of the <i>relation</i> of preceding feelings," and therefore 
are called "phenomena of simple suggestion;" and, on the other hand, 
"feelings which consist in the mere perception of relation," and 
therefore are called "phenomena of relative suggestion." Mr. Spencer 
concurs in making much of these "feelings of relation," as distinct 
from the mere feelings which are related. John S. Mill, however, 
declares,<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> "The simplest of all cases of relation are those expressed 
by the word 'antecedent' and 'consequent,' and by the word 
'simultaneous.' If we say, for instance, that the dawn preceded 
sunrise, the fact in which the two things, dawn and sunrise, were 
jointly concerned, consisted only of the two things themselves; <i>no 
third thing entered into the fact or phenontena at all. 
<!--
354 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p354"></a> 
Unless indeed we choose to call the succession of the two objects a 
third thing: but their succession is not something added to the things 
themselves, it is something involved in them. Our consciousness of the 
succession of these sensations is not a third sensation or feeling 
added to them: we have not first the two feelings, and then a feeling 
of their succession.</i> To have two feelings at all implies having 
them successively or else simultaneously. Sensations, or other feelings 
being given, succession and simultaneousness are the two conditions, to 
the alternative of which they are subjected by the nature of our 
faculties; and no one has been able, or needs expect, to analyze the 
matter any further." The writer's doctrine of relativity would seem to 
compel him to use this language. His colleague, Mr. Grote, takes an 
intermediate or a conciliatory view.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> He objects to the elder Mill 
for calling Space and Time abstract terms. In regard to Time, for 
instance, he thinks those wrong who call it "an abstract name for the 
pastness, the presentness, and the futureness of our successive 
feelings," instead of "a collective name for our feeling of their 
succession  -- that is, for what James Mill himself calls the part of 
the process "which consists in being sensible to their successiveness," 
to express which, he declares, "we have not a name." Grote, then, 
continues his comment precisely on the point upon which we are 
examining the divergent doctrines of the empirical school -- namely, 
upon their views as to that which it pleases them to style the feeling 
of relation. "This taking notice of the successiveness 
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 355 
--><A NAME="p355"></a> 
of our feelings, <i>whether we prefer to call it a part of the 
feelings themselves</i>, or <i>another feeling superadded to them</i>, 
is yet something which, in the entire mass of feeling which the 
successive impressions give us, we are able to discriminate and to name 
apart from the rest. A perception of succession between two feelings is 
a state of consciousness <i>per se</i>, which, though we cannot think 
of it separately from the feelings, we can yet think of it as a 
completed thing in itself, and not as an attribute of either or both of 
the two feelings. Its name, if it had one, would be a concrete name. 
But the entire series of these perceptions of succession has a name -- 
Time, which I, therefore, hold to be a concrete name." For those who 
take an intelligent interest in these discussions, and who are not 
indulging simply the delusion that they can freely pronounce upon them, 
without any real work in the way of study, it cannot but be striking to 
observe how empiricism is not such plain sailing as to the superficial 
reader it appears. Even on one of the ideas which is so all-important 
in its system as is Relation, obscurities begin to make themselves 
felt, and some of the minutiae, which are popularly supposed to be mere 
scholastic subtleties, are equivalently acknowledged to call for an 
examination into their nature.<p>
Again, the assertion that Space may be analyzed into relations of co-
existent feelings, and Time into relations of successive feelings, does 
not satisfy some of the empirics themselves. To start with, co-existent 
feeling obviously need not give <i>spacial</i> co-existence; and if it 
fails to give Space, it fails to 
<!--
356 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p356"></a> 
give just what was required of it. To say that one feeling is outside 
another simply in the sense of other or different from it, does not 
furnish the outsideness of Space. The idea of co-existence is by Mr. 
Spencer<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> analyzed into the idea of succession under special 
circumstances. His tendency to regard consciousness as made up rather 
of successive than of coexistent states, naturally leads him to 
pronounce the feeling of succession to be more primitive than the 
feeling of co-existence, and to derive the latter from the former. Of 
things exciting successive sensations we are able, on his theory, to 
predicate co-existence on condition that we are able to reverse the 
order of succession. Thus a cow and a horse co-exist, if at will we can 
pass without strain and with vividness from horse to cow and from cow 
to horse; and the same holds of the several objects that make up an 
outspread landscape. The objects are represented by successive 
sensations, but the power to vary the order of succession proves their 
co-existence. Lastly, not to be diffuse in these illustrations of the 
differences between empiric doctrines, we may mention that while he 
does not give up the above analysis of Space and Time as wrong, Mr. 
Bain does admit that there is a certain inadequacy in it, so that he is 
not so peremptory in his condemnation of innate ideas as some might 
expect. He contents himself with affirming that there is no proved 
necessity to have recourse to so unwelcome a theory, and that future 
labours may complete an analysis which at present is incomplete<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> 
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 357 
--><A NAME="p357"></a><p>
So much by way of specimen from the empiricists. On the other side, 
Kant boldly ranks Relation, Space, and Time among the <i>a priori</i> 
categories of the mind which no experience could give, and which no 
valid ground in reason warrants us in applying to things-in-themselves, 
as they exist outside the mind. Hegelians abolish the things-in-
themselves, but do not on that account succeed in giving a real basis 
to these fundamental conceptions. To teach equivalently that there is 
no reality but thought, will not satisfy those who are bent on seeking 
a more genuine reality for their thoughts than the undoubted fact that 
thought itself is real.<p>
Our course will be a mean. We shall rely neither upon mere accumulated, 
related sensations, nor upon innate forms; but we shall take such ideas 
as they arise out of experience, in a mind that has the consciously 
possessed power of seeing into what is objectively evident, and 
recognizing it as the real.<p>
(2) There is almost a superstition connected with the term Relation: 
indeed superstition consists in asserting a relation between two 
objects which is out of all proportion, so that the effect assigned to 
a cause is quite beyond its natural powers. It is, therefore, 
superstitious to think that a man's destiny is settled by the star 
under which he is born. Mill has much right on his side when he affirms 
his inability "to see in what respect Relation is something more 
recondite than any other attribute; indeed it seems to be so in a 
somewhat less degree." 
<!--
358 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING.  
--><A NAME="p358"></a><p>
A relation is defined to be the way one thing holds itself in regard to 
another -- <i>habitudo unius ad alterum</i>. It therefore requires 
three elements, that which is related, that to which it is related, and 
that whereby the relation is constituted. The first is the 
<i>subject</i>, the second the <i>term</i>, and the third the 
<i>foundation</i> of the relation. All agree in making the subject and 
the foundation <i>intrinsic</i> to the relation: but the term to which 
the subject is related, is by some deemed <i>extrinsic</i>, inasmuch as 
it is that to which the relation is directed, not the relation itself. 
At least in all created things a relationship can be reversed, the 
<i>term</i> becoming subject and the subject becoming <i>term</i>; in 
which process we must observe whether the same denomination applies to 
both members, as when A is brother to B, and B is brother to A, or 
whether the denomination is different, as when A is father to B, and B 
is son to A: as also whether both members are existent, or one existent 
and the other merely ideal.<p>
The conditions of a real relation are easily assignable; there must be 
a real distinction between the <i>subject</i> and the <i>term</i> -- at 
least such distinction as holds between a whole and its part -- and the 
<i>foundation</i> must be real. There is, however, an ambiguity about 
the foundation; sometimes it is considered <i>inadequately</i> as it 
affects the subject only, at other times it is considered 
<i>adequately</i> as it affects the term also. In the real relation of 
teacher to taught the adequate foundation is all that passes mutually 
between master and pupil in their respective charncters as such. Thus 
we are thrown 
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 359 
--><A NAME="p359"></a> 
back on a remark like that which we had to make in reference to 
causation; what we roughly speak of as simply "the cause" often 
includes a multiplicity of causes, and what we roughly speak of as 
simply "the relation" often includes a multiplicity of relations. A 
sculptor's relation to the statue which he produces entails every 
single stroke of his chisel, and more besides. Indeed, whenever we have 
a difficulty about a relationship, the obstacle is not from the special 
nature of relation as such, but from obscurity as to the facts involved 
in a particular case.<p>
Real as a relation may be, it is often true that, as the formation of 
it is a past event, it is only by its preservation in the memory that 
it can be known. We cannot read in a man's outward frame that another 
has been in past time a benefactor to him. Still the relation is real, 
not merely mental. A mental relation is one which is not constituted 
except by an act of the mind distinguishing in objects what is not 
really distinct. Thus, according to our view, the relation between the 
individuality in a living man and his specific nature, as that nature 
exists in the concrete, is mental, for there is no real distinction 
between the two. Also, it is said that the relation between object 
known and person knowing, though real on the side of the latter, is not 
so on the side of the former, because this is in no way altered by the 
fact. A man is neither fatter or leaner simply for being known. 
Nevertheless, inasmuch as a material object acts on the senses to 
produce a knowledge of itself, 
<!--
360 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p360"></a> 
it establishes a real causal relation on its own part. Also the 
relation of similitude between any idea and its object, though it comes 
under the definition of mental relation so far as it is "constituted by 
the mind," yet is not described by these words in their intended 
signification; it is rather a real relation, for the idea is real: its 
object is real and really other than the idea, and the foundation is 
real. Besides real and mental relations, philosophers also enumerate on 
another principle of division transcendental and predicamental. The 
former are so called because they are found in all things without 
exception; everything by its own nature, without additional 
modification, bears some relationship. This is true even of God, as we 
see in the revealed doctrine of the Blessed Trinity. It is true that 
the schoolmen are not uniform in their account of the "transcendental" 
relation; but the simplest way is to take it as we have said, for a 
relation which is essential to a thing because it is what it is. 
Thereby the contrast is brought out, for the opposite to transcendental 
is the predicamental relation, an accident which may come and go, and 
which derives its name from the fact that it is the <b>pros ti</b> of 
the Aristotelian <i>predicamenta</i>. Such a relation is one that may 
or may not be present, that is not simply essential to its subject, but 
superinduced upon it, not necessary to it, but contingent, as to be 
President of the United States, whatever be a man's inborn ability for 
that office.<p>
Next we may inquire whether anything can be purely a relation and not 
also something absolute. 
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 361 
--><A NAME="p361"></a> 
Some of the schoolmen go near to affirming a purely relative thing 
when they assert that a real relation is a sort of diminutive entity, 
intermediate between the terms related, and really distinct from each 
and from the foundation of the relationship. It seems better to submit 
this doctrine to the edge of Ockam's razor, Entities are not to be 
multiplied unnecessarily. But we may go further, and say that all 
relation is founded on the absolute, and no purely relative Being can 
exist. Absolute, however, has a variety of meanings which need some 
discrimination. It may mean the independent, that which in reference to 
any other is absolved or free from all tie or obligation both physical 
and moral: and so it would apply pre-eminently to God. It may mean also 
that which is complete in its own nature, which is finished and 
perfect: God again is thus absolute inasmuch as He is infinite 
perfection. But as opposed simply to the relative, the absolute is that 
which is taken in itself and on its own account. Everything in the 
order of logical if not of chronological priority, first of all is, and 
then is in reference to something else: it has thus its absolute and 
its relative aspect, and the one cannot be without the other. Of course 
before a real relationship is complete there must be some real other to 
complete it; and this is all the truth that is to be found in Locke's 
words,<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> "Relation is not contained in the real existence of things, 
but is something extraneous and superinduced." Every absolute thing has 
its foundation on account of which it is apt to enter into a trans<!--
362 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p362"></a>cendental relation, without any change in itself, as soon as the 
other term is posited; also by means of of various activities and 
passivities a variety of other relationships can be contracted. But in 
every case there is no reality beyond the absolute agents and the 
absolute activities and passivities, though these at the same time that 
they are absolute are also relative. There is no contradiction here, 
for it is under different aspects that they are at once absolute and 
relative. They exist each of them in their own nature, but they exist 
each in connexion with other natures. So much is admitted even by so 
stout a defender of the relativity of all knowledge as Mr. Spencer, 
with the exception that he allows us only an "obscure consciousness," 
not strictly a "knowledge" of the absolute element. "The existence of 
the non-relative," he says, "is unavoidably asserted in every chain of 
reasoning by which relativity is proved."<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>
Here is an appropriate place to declare our objection to the Hegelian 
doctrine that the mind is the only relating faculty, while all objects 
of sense are isolated and without order. We object also to the excess 
of relativity in writers like Mr. Bain, who, much probably to his own 
dissatisfaction, has been claimed on this score as a Hegelian. "I end 
with the remark," says Mr. F. H. Bradley,<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> "that it would be 
entertaining and an irony of fate if the school of experience fell into 
the cardinal mistake of Hegel. Professor Bain's <i>Law of 
Relativity</i>, approved by J. S. Mill, has at least shown 
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 363 
--><A NAME="p363"></a> 
a tendency to drift in that direction. 'Our cognition, as it stands, 
is explained as a mutual negation of the two properties. Each has a 
positive existence because of the presence of the other as its 
negative.' I do not suggest that Professor Bain in this ominous 
utterance really means what he says, but he means quite enough to be on 
the edge of a precipice. If the school of experience had any knowledge 
of facts, they would know that the sin of Hegel consists, not at all in 
defect, but in excess of Relativity. Once say with Professor Bain that 
'we know only relations:' once <i>mean</i> (what he says) that those 
relations hold between positives and negatives, and you have accepted 
the main principle of orthodox Hegelianism.<p>
The safe course is to give each side its due: individual objects are 
absolutely in themselves, but they are not only absolute; they also 
enter into real relations of causality and dependence, of likeness and 
unlikeness. The same things are both absolute and relative; and in a 
closely interconnected world like ours, where actions and re-actions 
are so multiplex, where the transformations of energy are so perpetual, 
attention has of late been so much called to the relative aspects of 
things, that the absolute have been either overlooked or denied, in 
spite of the pretty obvious truth, that the relative implies the 
absolute.<p>
(3) In turning next to the predicament or category <i>Ubi -- Where</i>, 
we come across the idea of Space, about which so much mystery has been 
made, and so much also really must exist. For we ourselves 
<!--
364 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p364"></a> 
fully allow the very imperfect knowledge we have on this subject, as 
is proved by certain puzzling questions that can be proposed, and also 
by certain mysteries of our faith which bring us to be acquainted with 
possibilities in Space, at least under preternatural conditions, which 
we should not have suspected, and which, even when revealed, leave us 
unable to understand their possibility. What we have to do is to take 
the natural conditions of body in Space, not the preternatural, and to 
make such assertions as the evidence of the case justifies. We shall 
find, as usual, that something is left to agreement about the use of 
terms, and that not all significations are precisely settled on the 
ground that there is only one way of looking at things; often there are 
more ways than one.<p>
Great noise is sometimes raised about the mode in which we come to know 
<i>extension</i>. Strained efforts are made to evolve the conception 
out of simpler elements of sensation, or else to show<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> such 
evolution impossible and so to discredit the notion altogether as 
unreal. But in truth, if, as the facts stand, we have an extended, 
sensitive body and live in the midst of other extended bodies, and have 
a mind capable of intelligent reflexion, it does not seem so very 
extraordinary that we should be convinced of extension as an actual 
reality. What is the use of raising imaginary difficulties against a 
clear verdict of experience? especially when the  
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 365 
--><A NAME="p365"></a> 
difficulties are urged on the strength of convictions, to say the 
least of it, not a whit better established than the conviction they are 
intended to upset. When we are solemnly assured, in opposition to the 
derivation from experience, that the idea of space is not given in the 
sensation of body, we answer that no idea is ever given in any 
sensation, if thereby is meant that the sensation already contains the 
idea as such. But if we take the right doctrine about the validity of 
intellectual perception of objects that have passed through the medium 
of sensitive cognition, we shall find no reason to distrust our 
knowledge of space by ordinary experience, and shall be very little 
disturbed by the assurances of Hamilton and Reid,<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> that extension 
cannot be analyzed into sensation. We shall listen unmoved to the 
latter's usual cry of "mystery:" "How the notion of extension comes 
into the mind is utterly inexplicable. It is true that we have feelings 
of touch which every moment present extension to the mind; but how they 
come to do so is the question, for these faculties do no more resemble 
extension than they resemble justice or courage -- nor can the 
existence of extended things be inferred from those feelings by any 
rules of reasoning; so that the feelings we have by touch can neither 
explain how we get the notion nor how we come by the belief of extended 
things." Of course a feeling by touch contains neither an intellectual 
conception nor an intellectual belief; but if man has been created a 
rational Being that acts by sense and intellect, when 
<!--
366 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p366"></a> 
the sensitive part is touched by an extended body and sensitively 
perceives it, it is no wonder if the mind is prompted to elicit the 
idea of extension. This is a more satisfactory account than Reid's 
favourite device of "natural suggestion," though that phrase might be 
meant to convey all we mean. Usually, however, "suggestion" is not the 
word we use for the origination of fresh ideas, but rather we employ it 
to signify the calling up or the putting together of old ideas by 
associated conceptions. Extension has been defined, <i>Partium extra 
partes positio</i> -- "The position of parts outside parts," which is 
not strictly a definition, because it cannot be said to consist of 
terms simpler than the one to be defined. Even if we leave the word 
"part" undiscussed, at least "outside" means spacial outsideness, that 
is, it implies the idea of extension, and is not a simpler element out 
of which extension is compounded. We may be excused then, if for the 
sake of clearness, we go straight on with our explanation, and do not 
stop to consider those perversely ingenious theories, which have for 
their practical result, either to throw doubt on Space or very much to 
mystify a notion which, as far as it goes, is simple enough.<p>
Assuming, therefore, that we know extended bodies, we might consider, 
in the abstract, all the real<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> extension in the material universe; 
then if we named this Space, we should be assigning to the word  
<!--
RELATION, SPACE. AND TIME. 367 
--><A NAME="p367"></a> 
a possible meaning, and not only a possible but an actually received 
meaning. For Locke says that real Space is the really extended 
universe, and Cartesians make a similar use of the word. Descartes 
himself we leave out, because of his unfortunate identification of body 
with extension; an error from which many of his followers have shaken 
themselves free. To them we allow the possibility of understanding 
under the name of real Space the actual extension presented by created 
matter, and under the name of ideal Space, the extension that might be 
presented if more matter were created. On this theory, however, any 
vacuum between parts of the universe would have to be regarded as ideal 
Space; an exception which Descartes provided against by the assertion 
of necessary plenum, and by saying that two bodies between which no 
other body intervenes must <i>eo ipso</i> be in contact. Against the 
above view of Space stands the fact that it does not square well with 
the ordinary usages of speech, according to which things are in Space 
as the contained within the containing. This idea of Space as a 
container is better preserved by the old Peripatetic school of 
philosophers, whose view Cartesians ought to regard as at least 
permissible. What it is will appear if we begin from Aristotle's 
definition, not of Space, but of place<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> <b>to tou periechontos peras 
akin&ecirc;ton pr&ocirc;ton</b> -- a celebrated phrase which is 
rendered into Latin, <i>Corporis ambientis terminus immobilis 
primus</i>, or into English, "The superficies of the containing body 
<!--
368 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p368"></a> 
considered as immoveable and immediately contiguous to the body 
located." In other words, the <i>place</i> of a body immersed in water 
is the immediate watery surface which touches it all round, and which 
is considered, for convenience, as unchangeable. A fossil immoveably 
imbedded in a rock, if it were suddenly annihilated would leave a 
perfect definition of its place; while a body on the very confines of 
creation for want of a containing superficies, would have no real place 
on that side by which it was turned towards vacant space. A single body 
existing alone, if we may make such a supposition, would have no real 
place at all in the Aristotelian sense. Later writers have added, that 
it would have no extrinsic place, no place marked by an extrinsic 
superficies, but would have an intrinsic place, marked by its own 
superficies. To avoid the inconveniences which come from the perpetual 
changes of place that are ever going on, all over the known universe, 
we are obliged to take certain relatively fixed boundaries as 
equivalently immoveable. Absolute fixity of place is impossible for us; 
but no serious inconvenience to our calculations happens on that score. 
If, then, Aristotle's definition cannot be applied with physical 
nicety, it has a moral applicability which makes it sufficient. Our big 
ship, the world, sailing on the ocean of ether, does not rock so that 
we cannot be as if at rest on its surface. We may repeat the doctrine 
about place in the words of Cardinal Zigliara.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> "Place is conceived 
as a bounding object, the outer surface 
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 369 
--><A NAME="p369"></a> 
of which shuts in, as it were, the room which the thing located has 
occupied; and though this outer surface really changes, yet 
equivalently and in so far as the circumscribed limits are the same, it 
remains identical. Hence we say that a man standing in a stream abides 
in the same place, in spite of the constant flow of the water which 
surrounds him."<p>
Having determined upon a meaning of <i>place</i>, we shall easily 
settle one for <i>Space</i>. They are not so much two different 
notions, as two notions each with the same total content, yet reversing 
the order in the part of it which is to be emphasized, and the part 
which is insinuated. Place is emphatically the bounding surface, with a 
reference to the interval, or voluminal distance, included within it; 
while Space is emphatically this interval, or voluminal distance, with 
a reference to the bounding surface. The place of a man immersed in 
mid-ocean, and supposed stationary, is the bounding surface of the 
water with a reference to the room which it encloses and the man fills; 
his Space is the same room in reference to the surface of water that 
defines its limits. Space is real, no matter whether it be filled or 
not with substance, if only the bounding superficies is real: it is 
imaginary if the bounds are not real but imaginary. Here the schoolmen 
mean by "real" not all tnat the word signifies in its wider sense, but 
what it means in its narrower sense, when it stands for the actually 
existent. We can give no sense to our words if we take as our absolute 
Space a purely imaginary extension, without any reference 
<!--
370 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p370"></a> 
to the actual; but if we start from the given, actual Space, we can 
assign a definite sense to imaginary Space. Thus if a man goes in fancy 
to the confines of creation, he can there imagine an extension reaching 
out a thousand miles in this or that direction. If, however, he 
neglects all consideration of given objects in Space, and merely asks 
himself, where a single atom would be if created alone, he can only say 
that it is where it is. He has no co-ordinates to which he can refer 
it; hence he can describe it only on its own account.<p>
The <i>Ubi</i> of a body or its <i>ubication</i>, is what constitutes 
it in its place. We must distinguish what <i>constitutes</i> the 
<i>ubi</i> from what is its <i>efficient cause</i>. Thus the force of a 
bow may send an arrow into a target and so be the efficient cause of 
the change from the old place to the new; but it is not the constituent 
of the new ubication, namely, the presence of the thing located to its 
place, or containing superficies. Space as thus explained is shown to 
be an idea derivable by abstraction from ordinary experience,<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> and 
to have the reality which belong to other ideas generalized from 
concrete individual things. Space, then, is not, as Cousin supposed, 
itself a universal <i>a parte rei</i>; nor is it, as Kant imagined, an 
<i>a priori</i> subjective form of the senses, without any objective 
validity that we can make certain of; nor is it, as Newton and Clarke 
contended, one of God's attributes, namely, the  
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 371 
--><A NAME="p371"></a> 
Divine immensity; nor finally is it, as Gassendi taught, a distinct 
creation, serving as the recipient of other extended creatures. All 
these views are sufficiently refuted by a clear statement of the 
correct view, which carries with it its own evidence. Space thus shows 
itself to be neither a distinct entity nor a non-entity; neither a 
purely real nor a purely ideal object; it has the reality proper to a 
term generalized by abstraction from actual existences. But the 
generalization must be effected by a genuine power of intelligence; it 
cannot be done, as our English empirics suppose, by repeated 
sensations.<p>
Just as an illustration how a slight change of aspect does not affect 
the truth of doctrine, we may mention that some would not be satisfied 
with real boundaries as constituting real Space, even when the interval 
between them is a vacuum. We have taken that view for its convenience. 
Cardinal Zigliara requires the interval to be occupied with body. "Real 
Space," he says,<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> "is real extension, and hence body really extended 
between two other bodies, or between two parts of the same body." 
Without attacking the possibility of this definition, we have preferred 
another, which insists on the reality of the bounding surface only, 
while it allows the contained volume to be either a plenum or a vacuum, 
as long as its size remains the same in both cases.<p>
(4) It is usual to introduce the subject of Time with a quotation from 
St. Augustine: "What is 
<!--
372 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p372"></a> 
Time? If no one asks me I know, but if some one asks me, and I try to 
explain, then I don't know." Nevertheless, we must try to frame an 
answer to the question, after the same manner in which we proceeded in 
regard to Space. But at once we must notice a difference. Space is made 
up of co-existent parts, Time is continuous succession, and as it is 
always on the move, it has no actual parts in extension. Some have 
devised the word <i>protension</i> for it; but this does not help much, 
except as a reminder to beware of differences.<p>
In order to show the reality of Time, and to confute such opinions as 
we find in Kant, that Time is an <i>a priori</i> form of internal 
sensibility, the best way is to take the elements whence we derive the 
notion. If occasionally instead of rigorously defining terms by terms 
still more simple, we are able only to substitute synonyms one for 
another, the elementary character of the notions with which we are 
dealing is the satisfactory account of the proceeding. To begin with, 
we are evidently on real ground when we say that things have duration, 
which is described as "the perseverance of an object in existence." On 
the strength of another treatise, we are justified in asserting an 
external world; we are equally justified in asserting that its objects 
actually and in themselves endure. Duration, however, may be of two 
kinds: an object may endure without any intrinsic change whatever, and 
such is the eternity of God: it is existence all together and perfect; 
or an object may endure with intrinsic change, with a movement of 
succession 
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 373 
--><A NAME="p373"></a> 
within itself. There is manifestly such a succession in some of the 
accidents of a substance; also in those changes which the schoolmen 
call substantial, and attribute to "the generation and corruption of 
substantial forms." There is succession here, though the transformation 
itself is supposed to be instantaneous, not a continuous movement. Next 
it is asked whether this duration has a reality. Some reality it 
undoubtedly has because it is embodied in concrete facts. But is it a 
reality distinct from the thing which endures? In God certainly not. 
But what about creatures? They might absolutely have existed not when 
they do, but at far distant times; they might have a longer or a 
shorter duration. Furthermore, their duration depends on the 
continuance of God's conserving power, for no finite object, by its 
sole creation, is endowed with the attribute of independent duration. 
Thus, though the duration of creatures be not a distinct entity apart, 
added on to things, it is not completely identified with their 
substance.<p>
Some straightway affirm that Time is successive duration in creatures: 
it is the movement of objects in the course of the world; or, as Locke 
says, it is especially the movement of human thoughts one after 
another.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> As, however, we had to point out, that whatever be the 
possibility of understanding by Space the actually extended universe of 
matter, it does not answer to ordinary modes of speech about Space, so 
we have again to call attention to 
<!--
374 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p374"></a> 
the fact, that whatever be the possibility of calling Time the 
successions in the course of created existences, this is not exactly 
the common acceptation of the word. For commonly Time is considered as 
a continuous flow without interruption: Time stops for no man; Time is 
neither quick nor slow, but always uniform. Whereas movements take 
place in Time, they do not simply constitute Time, they are 
interrupted, and of variable velocity. These are familiar expressions, 
and they do not fit in with the view just mentioned, which is often 
called the Cartesian, though Descartes himself inclines to call time a 
<i>modus cogitandi</i>, a way of thinking about things as having 
duration, which way of thinking is unchanged, whether the duration be 
successive or not.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> It is much disputed what sort of succession, or 
whether any succession, is presented by angelic substance in its 
continued existence<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> but apart from such disputable matters many 
objects certainly present us no evenly continuous motion such as would 
suffice for Time. Hence we take the movements of the heavenly bodies as 
affording us the most even and uninterrupted movement we can find, and 
from them we get our measure of Time. If according to this explanation 
there is no real entity which is simply and formally Time, yet Time is 
clearly founded in reality; it has a reality in the real motion of 
things, and is not a mere Kantian form of inner experience. 
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 375  
--><A NAME="p375"></a><p>
We will repeat our explanation for the sake of clearness. Time, like 
Space, is neither a simple reality nor a simple fiction of the mind; it 
is an idea founded in reality, but not exactly answering to it. Space, 
we said, does not exist as such; but there do exist extended bodies 
marking out definite volumes; the volume marked out by the bounds of 
the actual universe is called real Space, and imaginary Space may be 
extended beyond this unlimitedly. If the whole universe is moving off 
in some direction, then even real Space is not a fixture, but we have 
no other real term against which to measure its direction. Time is very 
much the same kind of notion, but with peculiarities of its own. For 
Time especially we must assume the validity of memory, which being 
granted, we become certain that real changes go on in the world. Not 
every change involves Time, for in place of one body God might 
instantaneously substitute another; but change in the stricter sense 
takes place within the same substance, so that the two successive 
states are the contradictory one of another. Here it is that the 
opinion of Balmez is of some use. He traces the notion of Time to the 
principle of contradiction: "A thing cannot both be and not be 
simultaneously." If he merely fastens on the adverb "simultaneously," 
that of course contains the idea of time; but if he fastens on the 
contrast of being and not being, then undoubtedly there is in 
successive change such a contrast. That a thing should be in its 
altered state at the same time that it is unaltered is a contradiction. 
Nevertheless, we 
<!-- 
376 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p376"></a> 
cannot in this way pretend to have simplified Time. We must trust to 
the power of memory for giving us a <i>before</i> and an <i>after</i> 
as marked by some change. Thus we come to know that things really 
endure amid changes. Next we can find out a real process of change, 
such that, being itself sufficiently regular, it will serve to measure 
those other changes which are irregular. So far we are dealing with 
realities. The things are real, the changes are real, the regularities 
and irregularities of change are real; but we have not exactly come 
across Time as the abstract, which is "successive duration," apart from 
all concrete objects, and from all reference to rate of succession or 
to possible interruption. We can, however, so prescind from all such 
circumstances as to put before ourselves the idea of a point regarded 
as moving not simply in Space, but in successive Duration; an 
indivisible <i>now</i> ever leaving the past behind it and invading the 
future, yet never itself actually either past or future. There is no 
actual thing which is this point; the actualities are all objects 
liable to changes in more or less irregular succession. Ideally we fix 
upon an even flow of duration, and we call this Time. Time is not a 
thing, but it marks a real fact in the successions of things.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> In 
reference to things it is idealized, as is geometry. The definition 
which Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> gives of Time may now be brought forward with some 
good prospect of being easily understood. "Time 
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 377 
--><A NAME="p377"></a> 
is the number of movement, estimated according to its <i>before</i> 
and its <i>after</i> " -- <b>arithmos kin&ecirc;se&ocirc;s kata to 
proteron kai husteron</b>.  Some refer the <i>before</i> and the 
<i>after</i> to Space and not to Duration, lest they should seem to be 
guilty of the fallacy of <i>idem per idem</i>; but we cannot thus 
derive temporal from local succession. There may be temporal without 
local succession, as in the flow of thought, and mere place will never 
give Time. Aristotle says that then we reach the notion of Time, when 
we reduce to number a succession which is marked by the characters of 
prior and of subsequent in point of duration. St. Thomas gives a 
paraphrase of Aristotle's words:<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> "It is clear that we affirm Time 
to be when in a movement we can fix upon a <i>this term</i> and a 
<i>that term</i>, with an interval between the two. For when we 
consider both extremes of an interval, and when the mind perceives two 
<i>nows</i>, one antecedent, the other subsequent, and counts the 
<i>before</i> and the <i>after</i> in the movement, then we have 
<i>Time</i>. . . . Time is nothing else but the number of movement, 
estimated as <i>before</i> and <i>after</i>, for we perceive time when 
we number before and after in movement. It is evident, then, that Time 
is not movement, but is consequent upon movement, when this is 
expressed by number." It is no fault of the Aristotelian definition 
that it cannot define terms already simple by still simpler; so that if 
"before" and "after," which enter into the account of Time, already 
suppose the notion which they are meant to explain, this cannot be 
helped. 
<!--
TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 378  
--><A NAME="p378"></a> Whether Time is said to have real parts or not, is a matter that 
depends largely on how we look at the question. As the past is past and 
the future is yet future, neither of them is actual; but in so far as 
the past actually has been traversed whereas the future has yet to be 
traversed, the former has a sort of advantage. It is common, however, 
to say that only the present is actual; but because the present is a 
point with no duration, we seem to be thrown across the awkward result 
that the only actuality in time is very like nothing. But we need not 
be distressed, for we are already acquainted with the degree of reality 
that is needful for an idea abstracted from individual conditions. We 
have a choice between supposing as many different <i>nows</i> as we 
mark different instants in a long duration, or with St. Thomas,<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> we 
may regard <i>now</i> "as substantially the same throughout the 
duration," and still say with the same authority<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> that "Time has no 
entity except according to the indivisible now." We may compare the 
course of time to the tracing out of a line by a point travelling in 
Space. The line indeed so traced has all its parts actually co-existent 
at the end of the operation, whereas Time has no such co-existence. The 
comparison, however, consists in this: to each point of Space in the 
line there corresponds a point in the duration of Time; and if we do 
not say that each point of Space was traversed <i>during</i> its 
corresponding 
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 379 
--><A NAME="p379"></a> 
point of Time, the obstacle lies in the word <i>during</i>.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> 
Nevertheless the points in both orders are really assignable limits; 
they are not distinct entities, constituting a part of the extension, 
yet they answer to real truths in the order of Space and Time. The 
conclusion is, that the indivisibility of a point of Time no more tells 
against the reality of Time than the indivisibility of the point of 
Space tells against the reality of Space; and if Time has not co-
existent parts as Space has, yet it has parts in the only way possible, 
to a continuous succession. Its parts are not finite periods of rest, 
but finite measures of the ever-moving duration, such as the minutes 
and hours marked by the ceaseless rotation of the earth. Thus no 
measurable part is ever strictly an actuality; but this does not 
detract from such reality as we attribute to Time, for our doctrine has 
been that there is no distinct entity called Time, as there is no 
distinct entity called Space; and that nevertheless both have real 
foundations, one in the succession of events, and the other in the 
extension of bodies. It must have been clear that half the perplexities 
which beset the question of Time, come from a want of a proper 
conception of continuous motion; which, being a continuum and a 
movement, cannot be treated as though it were made up of discrete parts 
at rest. Aristotle allows that movement is strictly undefinable -- an 
<b>aoriston</b>.<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> He has,  
<!--
380 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p380"></a> 
however, attempted such a <i>quasi</i> definition as the case admits 
of, and thereby, until it is discovered on what principle he was 
proceeding, he may seem to have justified the oft-made charge, that he 
has wrapped up a very clear idea in very dark language. He was 
unwilling to speak of motion as a transfer, or to call it by any other 
name which was simply synonymous with itself; but he thought that if he 
could express it in terms of act and potency, he would be using ideas 
that run through all the categories, divide all Being, and are most 
fundamental as conceptions. So he defined motion in terms of potency 
and act, and described it as uniting these two in a very peculiar 
manner. Motion is in act so far as it is actually started, and no 
longer exists simply as potential in the cause that was to produce it; 
but it is in potency inasmuch as it has not yet reached its term and 
effected its final purpose, that is, its relatively final purpose, for 
the transmutation effected may rapidly give place to another. Full of 
these ideas, Aristotle wrote what sounds so strange to some ears, which 
we need not straightway call "long ears," but at least we may ask that 
they be willing to open themselves patiently to words that are far from 
being wholly foolish: "Motion is the act of that which is potential, 
inasmuch as it is potential " -- h&ecirc; tou duname ontos entelecheia 
h&ecirc; toiouton.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup><p>
Aristotle was wrong on one point because he did not know the truth of 
creation; he asserted the  
<!--
RELATION, SPACE, AND TIME. 381 
--><A NAME="p381"></a> 
eternity of motion as an evident truth -- <b>d&ecir;lon h&ocirc; estin 
aidios kin&ecirc;sis</b>. The possibility of such a thing is disputed; 
but leaving this discussion alone, we may turn our attention to the 
confusion that frequently arises from trying to translate eternity into 
terms of time. God's motionless eternity is the only actual eternity; 
we can assert it to be equivalent, and more, to indefinitely prolonged 
time, but we cannot even approach to a measurement of it by this means. 
When we say that God knows the future because it is present to Him, as 
all the circumference is present to the centre of a circle, we must 
beware lest we pass beyond the warrant which we have for such an 
expression. There is some truth in it, but it is not true if it is 
understood to mean that God does not recognize the reality of the 
succession in events. If it is correct to affirm that the future is 
present to God, it is also correct to affirm that the future is future 
to God -- that He knows it to be future, and will not at this moment 
justify a sinner who is going to repent forty years hence. It would be 
a marvellous novelty of doctrine in the Catholic Church to allow a man 
to go to Communion at Christmas on the strength of a good Confession he 
was to make at the Easter following, the theory being that all time is 
present to God. Futurity is a fact which God recognizes.<p>
Our labours to explain Time and Space have once more enforced the 
lessons so often put before us in the course of this treatise; that we 
can fix upon a deflnite meaning for our most generalized and ultimate 
ideas, and need not call them, with 
<!--
382 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p382"></a> 
Mr. Spencer, confused states of consciousness, unfit for the name of 
knowledge; that we can make sure of their real validity in the region 
of things; that nevertheless our knowledge is very far from exhaustive, 
and can be asserted only under its limitations. What mysteries gather 
round Time and Space, especially in their preternatural manifestations! 
What greater mysteries round God's Eternity and Immensity! and again, 
What mysteries in the relations of the first order, which is created, 
to the second which is uncreated! Yet of each we know something 
certain, and of their interrelations we also know something certain. 
General Metaphysics thus proves to be a human science, and has been 
treated as such throughout these pages -- neither as more nor as less. 
We have not claimed further insight into truths than that human insight 
which is manifestly our prerogative as intelligent creatures. But this 
we have claimed, and boldly claimed, against many whose philosophy 
consists in little except a plea for denying what we have been 
affirming. Positive in name, these writers are negative in fact; while 
we forego the name of positivists, but do in fact hold Metaphysics to 
be positive -- a positive science.

NOTES AND ILLUSTRATIONS.<p>
(1) Systems of Psychology characteristically distinguish themselves by 
the way in which they deal with the knowledge of relations; and the 
system to which the late Professor Green was attached, is shown by the 
following remarks in his Introduction to <i>Hume's Works</i>, &sect; 
40: "In making the general idea of substance precede the particular 
ideas of sorts of substances, Locke stumbled upon a truth which he was 
not aware of, and which will not fit into his ordinary doctrine of 
general ideas: the truth that knowledge is a process from the more 
abstract to the more concrete, not the reverse. Throughout Locke's 
prolix discussion of 'substance' and 'essence' we find two opposite 
notions perpetually cross each other; one that knowledge begins with 
the simple idea, the other that it begins with the real thing as 
particularized by manifold relations. According to the former notion, 
simple ideas being given, void of relation, as the real, the mind of 
its own act proceeds to bring them into relation and compound them; 
according to the latter, a thing of various properties (i.e., 
relations) being given as the real, the mind proceeds to separate these 
from each other. According to the one notion, the intellectual process, 
as one of complication, ends just where, according to the other notion, 
as one of abstraction, it began." Many of the schoolmen have propounded 
a doctrine that the simpler and therefore the more generalized ideas 
are formed first, and that particularizations follow gradually 
afterwards; but as they would wholly repudiate the mere subjective 
forms of Kant, and all innate ideas, so they would reject Green's ideas 
borrowed from "a universal consciousness," and giving relationship and 
order to the data of the several experiences, which are themselves a 
mere 
<!--
384 TRANSCENDENTAL BEING. 
--><A NAME="p384"></a> 
unordered multitude. A further result of Green's<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> system, opposed to 
all the results of our last chapter, is briefly given in a later 
passage of the same work, but a fuller explanation must be sought in 
the <i>Prolegomena Ethica</i>. Noting that Locke supposes "the co-
existence of real elements over a certain duration," and attributing 
this to imperfect analysis, the author says: "To a more thorough 
analysis there is no alternative between finding reality in 
<i>relations of thought</i>, which, because relations of thought, are 
not in time, and therefore immutable, and submitting it to such 
subdivision of time as <i>excludes all real co-existence</i>, because 
what is real or present at one moment, is unreal or present at the 
next."<p>
The point in this system to which we call special attention, is the 
reduction of all reality to "relations," which relations are not things 
in themselves, but are "constituted by the self-distinguishing 
consciousness, We attach no meaning to reality as applied to the world 
of phenomena, but that of existence under definite and unalterable 
relations, which can subsist only for a thinking consciousness." Thus 
is opened out a whole field of curious speculation which must have 
puzzled the Oxford students of a recent period, and which still holds 
sway in our seats of learning.<p>
(2) The same University had previously been puzzled by Mansel's 
doctrine about the relative and the absolute; and the pith of his 
theory may be gathered from the following paragraph:<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> "Hamilton, like 
Kant, maintained that all our cognitions are compounded of two 
elements, one contributed by the object known, the other by the mind 
knowing. But the very conception of a relation implies the existence of 
things to be related; and the knowledge of an object, as in 
<!--
RELATION, SPACE AND TIME  385
--><A NAME="p385"></a> 
relation to our mind, necessarily implies its existence out of that 
relation. How far it resembles, and how far it does not resemble, the 
object apprehended by us, we cannot say, for we have no means of 
comparing the two together. Instead, therefore, of saying with Kant, 
that the reason is subject to inevitable delusion, by which it mistakes 
the regulative principles of its own thoughts for the representations 
of real things, Hamilton would say that the reason, while compelled to 
belieye in the existence of these real things, is not legitimately 
entitled to make any positive representation of them as of such and 
such a nature; and that the contradictions into which it falls when 
attempting to do so, are due to an illegitimate attempt to transcend 
the proper boundaries of positive thought." Hegelians regard this as 
cowardly on the part of Kant and of Hamilton; they prefer to maintain 
that the contradictions of thought are also the contradictions of 
things, and that the whole life of the universe rests on a movement of 
contradiction and reconciliation.<p>
(3) M. Charles, in his <i>El&eacute;ments de Philosophie</i>, Vol. I. 
p. 239, suggests that though the "primary qualities" of body, or those 
founded on extension, are necessary to body as conceived by us, they 
may not be absolutely necessary. As regards bodies existing in some 
preternatural condition, we know that the character of extension in 
space may be dispensed with; but the fact does not at all invalidate 
the reality of extension in nature. A thing does not cease to be real, 
because it may be made to give place to some other condition of 
existence; even annihilation hanging over the material universe as its 
destiny, would not negative its present reality. Still less do 
preternatural conditions of extended objects in the concrete, take off 
from the absolute truth of mathematics, concerning extension in the 
abstract.<p>
