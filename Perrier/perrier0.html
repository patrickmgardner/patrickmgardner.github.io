The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Introduction</h1><hr><p>

One of the movements that have excited the interest of the
world of thought in the nineteenth century has been the revival
of Scholasticism. The philosophy of the Middle Ages had been,
for centuries past, buried in deepest oblivion. It had been 
considered inconsistent with the development of natural science;
and all, philosophers as well as scientists, deemed it dead -- a
most fitting end. It appeared to us, in the dim light of history,
as an ill-shapen monster, which had wandered in the darkness
of night, amid philters and mysterious juices, during the ages
in which men seriously considered alchemy and the philosopher's
stone. But the monster, thought we, had disappeared forever
at the light of modern discoveries, like the ill-omened bird of
night, which cannot abide the rays of the morning sun.<p>

Suddenly, to the astonishment of all, Scholasticism has
awaked from its slumber. It has appeared again in the face of
the world, has been accepted by great minds, has been expounded
and defended by powerful writers, and has given rise to a great
number of interesting philosophical works. Its admirers have
even tried, not only to prove its congruity with modern 
scientific results, but to show that it is the only system capable 
of explaining them.<p>

As was to be expected, such a revival has met with the most
severe criticism. Friedrich Paulsen, in the introduction to his
work <i>Immanuel Kant</i>, comparing Scholasticism with the 
Kantian system, expresses himself thus:<p>

"If Scholastic philosophy is at present experiencing a kind
of revival in the school of Catholicism, this is due, not so much
to its own inner vitality as to its supposed fitness to serve an 
ecclesiastical political system, which, through the favor of 
circumstances,  -- <i>patientia Dei et stultitia hominum</i>, an old 
Lutheran would say, -- has attained again in our time to unexpected
power. Moreover, there still remains the question whether 
continuance of existence is in general something of which a philosophy
can boast. Perhaps fruitfulness is a better characteristic
and this the Kantian philosophy shows; it still gives rise to new
systems of thought. Thomism, on the contrary, though  of
course a great achievement for its own time, yields to-day nothing 
except unfruitful repetitions. It does not set free the spirit,
it enslaves it, which of course is just its intention."<A HREF="perrierg.html#1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a><p>

In close connection with Paulsen's view stands the thesis
recently defended by Mr. Picavet in his famous <i>Esquisse d'une
histoire g&eacute;n&eacute;rale et compar&eacute;e des 
civilisations m&eacute;di&eacute;vales</i>. For
him, Scholastic philosophy and the body of Christian dogmas
are identical; the existence of God and the immortality of the
soul are the essential Scholastic doctrines. Accordingly, he
seems disposed to widen the field of Scholasticism, and to 
include within its limits a certain number of men whom 
neo-Scholastics will probably be loath to welcome as brethren. Not
only does he admit Descartes and Locke,<A HREF="perrierg.html#2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a> but also Rousseau and
Voltaire.<A HREF="perrierg.html#3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a>  He even feels inclined to add to his heterogeneous
list the name of Robespierre.<A HREF="perrierg.html#4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a> But the man to whom he directs
our attention with the greatest insistence, whom he regards as
a direct offspring of the Middle Ages, as a man "in the theological 
period still, a Christian, a Lutheran, a pietist, a Scholastic," 
is Immanuel Kant.<A HREF="perrierg.html#5"><SUP>[5]</sup></a><p>

Why not? Kant quotes the Bible; he develops the proof of the existence 
of God from final causes, and he is fond of repeating the  Hebrew 
meaning -- God with  us -- of his name  Immanuel.<A HREF="perrierg.html#6"><SUP>[6]</sup></a>  In religion, Kant 
is a supporter of the Christian doctrine; he advocates the existence of 
free-will; when he undertakes his <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, he 
is morally certain of the existence of God and of another life.<A HREF="perrierg.html#7"><SUP>[7]</sup></a> It 
is in Christian terms that he expresses the final conclusion he 
reaches, denouncing, as believers do, the insufficiency of speculative 
reason and ending with an act of faith.<A HREF="perrierg.html#8"><SUP>[8]</sup></a> In one word, Kant's work is 
an apologetic and may be compared to St. Thomas's <i>Summa contra 
Gentiles</i>. "Son oeuvre rappelle celle des apologistes, en 
particulier de Saint Thomas qui, dans la Somme contre les Gentils, veut 
amener au catholicisme, avec le seul appui de la raison, les 
mahom&eacute;tans, les juifs, les h&eacute;r&eacute;tiques de toutes 
les nuances. De m&ecirc;me Kant s'adresse aux ath&eacute;es et aux 
mat&eacute;rialistes, aux panth&eacute;istes et aux fatalistes, aux 
incr&eacute;dules et aux esprits forts."<p> 

The impulse given to neo-Thomism by Leo XIII is for Picavet
as well as for Paulsen, primarily and essentially a political
affair. In his survey of the progress of neo-Scholasticism in the
different countries of Europe and in America, it is not a speculative, 
but a political point of view that is invariably taken.
The acceptance of Thomistic speculation in Belgium is given as
one of the causes of the political successes obtained by Catholics
since 188~4. The strength of the Catholic party in Germany is
also insisted upon. In connection with the Thomistic revival,
Picavet quotes the fact that Prince Bismarck was constrained to
abandon the Kulturkampf, that the Catholic minority, giving
toasts to the pope and to the emperor, becomes more powerful
every day.<A HREF="perrierg.html#10"><SUP>[10]</sup></a><p>

Finally, &agrave; propos of neo-Scholasticism in the United States,
Picavet limits himself to considerations about the growing political 
and social influence of Catholics in this country, and speaks
of Bishop Ireland, and of the condemnation of the propositions
known as Americanism and contained in the "Life of Father
Hecker."<p>

In short, Picavet and Paulsen are unanimous in regarding
Scholasticism as a religious and political affair; but, whereas
Paulsen restricts the denotation of the word to Roman Catholicism, 
Picavet scems ready to enlarge its usual acceptation, so as
to make it embrace all Christian denominations. Picavet, however, 
would probably distinguish between Protestant and Catholic 
Scholasticism, so that his views as to the revival of Thomism
would closely resemble Paulsen's own views.<p>

There are two points which both authors clearly distinguish
and strongly insist upon:<p>

1. The essential agreement of the Thomistic philosophical
doctrine with the body of Catholic dogmas.<p>

2. The political signiflcance of the Scholastic revival.<p>

We will presently examine each of these points separately.<p>

With regard to the first, we may readily admit that there is
a great deal of truth in the foregoing theories. That the 
immediate cause of the revival of Thomism is its real or apparent
harmony with the body of theological doctrines of the Catholic
Church, it would be vain to deny. The following considerations
will dispell any doubt that might exist on this point:<p>

1. The greater number of modern philosophical systems have
been condemned by Catholic theologians as opposed to revealed
truth, and many among the leaders of modern thought have seen
their works placed on the <i>Index Librorum Prohibitorum</i>. We
find in the <i>Index</i> the names of Descartes, Malebranche, Locke,
Condillac, Hume, Kant, Rosmini, etc.<p>

2. The neo-Scholastic movement has been encouraged, since its very 
birth, by the visible head of the Catholic Church, Pope Leo XIII. In 
the encyclical <i>Inscrutabile Dei Consilio</i>, published in 1878, in 
the encyclical <i>Aeterni Patris</i> (1879), in briefs relating to the 
foundation of the Roman Academy of St. Thomas and of the <i>Institut 
Sup&eacute;rieur de Philosophie</i> of Louvain, as well as in many 
other writings, Leo XIII has promoted the study of the great mediaeval 
philosophers, and in particular of St. Thomac Aquinas.<p> 

3. As will be seen in the part of this work dealing with the
history of neo-Scholasticism, all the great writers of this school
belong to the Roman Catholic faith; most of them, in fact, are
Catholic priests.<p>

4. Moreover, St. Thomas Aquinas, who has always been regarded by 
Catholics as the greatest theologian, whose <i>Summa Theologica</i> is, 
and has always been, widely studied in ecclesiastical institutions, is 
the very philosopher to whom the new movement unanimously adheres. It 
is his doctrine that is expounded and commented upon in all 
neo-Scholastic treatises of philosophy. The two words Thomism and 
Scholasticism have become synonymous; periodicals founded to foster the 
revival of mediaeval thought have been called <i>Divus Thomas</i> and 
<i>Revue Thomiste</i>; and, in countries in which neo-Scholasticism has 
been most flourishing, St. Thomas is considered as the patron saint 
of philosophers.<p>

The element of truth we are actually considering ought not, however, to 
make us suppose that the Catholic faith and the Thomistic principles 
are necessarily bound together. The philosophy of Plato and St. 
Augustine had been the official philosophy of the Church for more than 
eight hundred years. And, at the appearance of St. Thomas's works, a 
strong current of opposition to his philosophy arose within the Church, 
nay within his own order, and gave birth to Duns Scotus's philosophy, 
which differs so widely from Thomism that it has been said that there 
is not a single proposition in the works of the Angelic Doctor which 
has not been controverted by his subtle rival. And despite this fact, 
Scotists profess to be as decidedly orthodox as their opponents, and, 
quite recently, S&eacute;cr&eacute;tan has even gone so far as to 
defend the thesis that the philosophy of Duns Scotus is more in harmony 
with the spirit of Christianity than the traditional Thomistic 
philosophy.<A HREF="perrierg.html#12"><SUP>[12]</sup></a> This seems to be 
also the view of Mr. John Dewey.<A HREF="perrierg.html#13"><SUP>[13]</sup></a><p>

In modern times, Catholic writers have repeatedly formulated
systems of thought which can be harmonized without too much
difficulty with Catholic dogmas. Descartes, Malebranche, Rosmini, 
Cousin, Lamennais, De Bonal~d, have had within the
Church itself numerous and illustrious disciples. Cousin's
eclecticism has been for many years the official philosophy of a
great number of Catholic institutions. Finally, in our own day,
despite the revival of Thomism and the encyclical of Leo XIII,
many of the orthodox, many ecclesiastics, do not think it amiss
to adhere to philosophical systems which, in their principles and
in their methods, are widely divergent from the Thomistic doctrine. 
Suffice it to mention the adherence of so many members
of the French clergy to the revival of Kantism, and the enthusiasm 
with which some eminent Catholics of the same country
have welcomed the appearance of Pragmatism.<p>

Passing now to the political significance of the Scholastic
revival, we will certainly concede that all the beliefs of a nation
have a more or less direct influence upon its political institutions. 
A nation is a great whole, a great social unit, whose
spirit is gradually formed by the conjoint influence of all the
elements at work among the race, is at the same time the effect
and the cause of the educational system, of the philosophy, of
the literature of the nation, of all and each one of the channels
through which her very blood and life flows.<p>

The political influence of the philosopher should not, however, 
be exaggerated. It is at once obvious that a man who
pretends to rise above mediocrity in any special field must 
concentrate thereto the energies of his whole life. He who wants
to become a great philosopher must not be anything else. A
few neo-Scholastics have entered the political arena; but, in so
doing, they have so little obeyed the spirit of neo-Scholasticism
that their course of action has been deplored by the Scholastics
themselves. A man who has been second to none in his perfect
grasping of the intentions of Leo XIII, Cardinal Gonzalez,
expressed his sincere regret when Orti y Lara abandoned the
field of philosophy to devote his talent to public 
affairs.<A HREF="perrierg.html#14"><SUP>[14]</sup></a><p>

The fitness of Scholasticism to serve the Catholic ecclesiastical
political system, which -- <i>patientia Dei et stultitia hominum</i> --
Paulsen regards as the only cause of the revival of Mediaeval
philosophy, cannot thus be its only cause, nor that which possesses 
the greatest significance in the history of human thought.
Besides the fact that the Church can accommodate itself to all
forms of government, and that there is therefore no Catholic
ecclesiastical political system -- as was pointed out by Mr. Domet
de Vorges in answer to Picavet <A HREF="perrierg.html#15"><SUP>[15]</sup></a> -- it must be borne in mind that
Scholasticism is, above all, a philosophy and must be characterized 
as a philosophy.<p>

The question of the cause of the neo-Scholastic revival leads
at once to the remark that it is not always possible to find in
the general conditions of any given period a definite and necessary 
cause for all the events which form its history. Historical
facts are often connected with unimportant, even trivial occurrences, 
so that it sometimes seems to the thoughtful man that
chance governs the world. Would Charles I have been executed
if young Oliver Cromwell had not been prevented from embarking 
for America? Would our civil war have taken place if
Henry Clay had defeated Polk in the elections of 1844? Would
there have been a neo-Scholastic revival if Sanseverino had died
when a young man and Leo XIII had not been elected to succeed 
Pius IX in the papal see? These are questions to which
I would not dare give an answer.<p>

The conditions of the possibility of an event must undoubtedly exist at 
the moment in which the event occurs; but there must also be found an 
occasional cause which may fail to appear, in which case the conditions 
of possibility may remain indefinitely in the same state, without any 
actual occurrence of the event.<p>

If we thus understand by the cause of the revival of Scholasticism 
the conditions which made it possible, we will find it
bound with a principle which is essential to the Catholic beliefs,
and, more distinctly than any other, separates the Roman Church
from all Protestant sects: the principle of the unity and 
immutability of truth. A brief exposition of St. Thomas's doctrine
on this point will not be out of place here.<p>

Truth, St. Thomas teaches, may be considered with regard to
our mind or with regard to things. With regard to our mind,
truth is in one sense multiple, because it consists in the 
conformity of our knowledge with the object, and there are as many
conformities as there are objects. With regard to things, truth
is also in one sense multiple, because the truth of a thing is the
very essence of the thing, and there are as many essences as there
are things. But truth is also one, in so far as the essence of a
thing is eternal and necessary, so that of one thing there can
be but one truth.<p>

As regards the other property of truth, its immutability,
St. Thomas teaches that truth considered in things is immutable
in so far as the essential characteristics are concerned, and
mutable only in the accidental elements. Truth, considered
with regard to our mind, is essentially immutable and accidentally 
mutable. It is mutable only in the sense that our mind
may pass from error to truth. It is essentially immutable,
because it is regulated by the truth of things, which is immutable. 
With regard to the Divine Mind, truth is essentially one
and immutable.<A HREF="perrierg.html#16"><SUP>[16]</sup></a><p>

This theory as to the nature of truth has been always strongly
defended by Catholic writers. They have been unanimous in
regarding internal change in a body of doctrine as an infallible
sign of error. It is upon the variations that had taken place
in Protestant creeds that Bossuet based his immortal <i>Histoire
des Variations</i>. You change, said he to Protestants, therefore
you err.<p>

Now, this fundamental principle of the Catholic Church is
essentially opposed to the individualism which has inspired modern 
philosophy. Since Descartes to our day, philosophy has not
been considered as a stereotyped body of truths. Each philosopher 
has been the author of a particular system of thought, and
there have thus arisen innumerable doctrines, often opposed,
sometimes contradictory to one another. This result is essentially 
antipathetic to a Catholic mind and incompatible with the
principle of the unity of truth. A Catholic will no doubt admit
that the principle of authority in philosophy is of secondary
importance. He will emphatically assert as well as any one
else, that every man must think with his own head; but, as he
maintains truth to be one and all human minds to be endowed
with a faculty of reasoning which works in the same way in all
of us, he will assert that we must necessarily reach identical
conclusions in our philosophical investigations.<p>

We need but to open the works of the early neo-Thomists to
be convinced that they regard the ephemeral character of modern
systems as the strongest argument in favor of Scholasticism.
Cornoldi's <i>Lectures on Scholastic Philosophy</i> are especially
interesting.<p>

"There is such a variety and contradiction in the doctrines
taught (in modern philosophy)," says he, "that one cannot 
adhere to one system without openly denying the others. The
diversity which reigns in modern schools is so general that two
professors can hardly be found, even in the same college, agreeing, 
I will not say upon the whole field of philosophy, but simply
upon its fundamental principles. Moreover, it becomes impossible 
to teach the same doctrine for ten years. There is a continuous 
change and contradiction. From the center of the
circle, which is one and indivisible, an infinite number of radii
may proceed and extend in all directions. In all fields of human
speculation, innumerable errors may likewise be found to diverge
more and more from the one and indivisible 
truth."<A HREF="perrierg.html#17"><SUP>[17]</sup></a><p>

And after having shown the diversity which reigns among
modern systems, Cornoldi appeals to the twenty centuries during
which Scholasticism was taught, to prove that this system, and
this system alone, can give an adequate explanation of scientific
discoveries.<A HREF="perrierg.html#18"><SUP>[18]</sup></a><p>

Now, truth being one and immutable, philosophy, which may
be described as a rational expression of the truth of things, will
also be one and immutable. And if there arise several philosophical 
systems, one of them at most will be true.<p>

The difficulty now will evidently lie in finding out the true
philosophy. Why should the Catholic Church favor Scholasticism 
rather than any other system? To this question again,
the principle of the unity of truth will furnish a satisfactory
answer.<p>

As will be seen in one of the chapters of this work, Catholics
admit philosophy and theology to be distinct sciences, having
different objects and different principles. They have different
objects in so far as philosophy is simply concerned with the
truths accessible to the light of human reason, whereas theology
is chiefly concerned with truths of a supernatural order. They
have different principles, in so far as philosophy is guided by
human reason, and theology by the authority of God.<p>

Although philosophy and theology are distinct sciences, they
often tread on a common ground. Many principles of faith,
many truths known from revelation are also accessible to reason. 
The immortality of the soul and the existence of God may
be discussed by the philosopher as well as by the theologian.<p>

The principle of the unity of truth being admitted, we must
also admit that, whenever philosophy and theology tread on a
common ground, they must be in perfect agreement. As truth
is essentially one, a conclusion of human reason cannot contradict 
a truth revealed by God. Whenever there is disagreement,
there is error on one side. But, as the error cannot lie in the
revealed truth, inasmuch as the authority of revelation rests
upon the infinite science and veracity of God, it follows that,
in all cases of disagreement between a philosophical principle
and a theological dogma, the philosophical principle must be
rejected.<p>

The only true system of philosophy will, therefore, be in perfect 
harmony with the body of revealed truths. That Scholastic
philosophy is not the only system capable of being harmonized
with religious dogmas, we have already shown. This is why,
after the speculative principles of the Middle Ages were judged
inadequate to meet the requirements of modern science, most
Catholics embraced other systems. But these systems have
not possessed the character of immutability which, in the mind
of Catholics, necessarily belongs to truth. Not only this. The
philosophical systems which have been successively accepted in
European speculation have departed -- or have been believed to
depart, which, for the point we are now discussing, amounts to
the same -- more and more from the essential principles of
Christianity. At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the
materialism of the encyclopedists was the only philosophy still
remaining in France. It was openly professed by Cabanis,
Broussais, Pinel and Bichat. It had displaced Cartesianism
itself, though a very limited number of ecclesiastics still adhered
to that system. At the same time, some of the emigrants whom
the ferocity of the Revolution had compelled to seek a refuge
abroad, were coming in contact with new-born Kantism, which
they were destined to introduce into their native land.<p>

It seems, at first blush, that the philosophy thus growing in
Germany was more in harmony with the great truths of Christianity 
than the impious materialism of the eighteenth century.
Whether the philosophical systems of Kant and his successors
may be interpreted from a Christian standpoint is a question
which has been frequently discussed and does not admit of an
easy solution. It is well known that the modern defenders of
Hegelian philosophy in America invoke St. Thomas's authority
in support of their principles.<A HREF="perrierg.html#19"><SUP>[19]</sup></a> 
For my part, I feel inclined to admit that their claim is not 
altogether devoid of foundation. Although St. Thomas and Hegel present 
evident points of contrast, it may be seriously questioned whether 
there exists between the systems they have built that abyss which 
neo-Scholastics are wont to point out. Whatever the truth may be, there 
is no doubt that Kant and Hegel have been invariably regarded by 
Catholics as the most dangerous opponents of the fundamental Christian 
principles.  "More than any other philosophical system,~ says Jules 
Didiot, Kantism has been a serious menace to faith and natural virtues 
in Catholic countries."<A HREF="perrierg.html#20"><SUP>[20]</sup></a> 
Didiot is more severe still with regard to Hegelianism:<p> 

"If he (Hegel) has not intended to mock at his pupils, at
his readers, at his predecessors in subjectivism and monism, we
must admit that his mind was at times in a state of delirium.
It is a shame for the nineteenth century not to have rejected
such a philosophy with indignation. . . . That Protestant 
ministers in Germany may have endeavored to harmonize the 
doctrines of Hegel and Schelling, of Fichte and Kant, with the
dogmas and laws of Christianity, can perhaps be conceived; but
that Catholic priests, such as Hermes, Baader, G&uuml;nther, may
have dared imitate them, even from afar and with a certain
moderation, is indeed hard to understand."<A HREF="perrierg.html#21"><SUP>[21]</sup></a><p>

This influence of Hegel among German Catholics, so vividly
deplored by Didiot, was indeed a fact in the first half of the
nineteenth century. The Holy See was obliged to interfere.
Hermes's doctrines were condemned in 1835 and 1836, G&uuml;nther's 
in 1857 and 1860, Frohschammer's in 1862, pantheism and
all forms of rationalism by the Syllabus of 1864.<p>

Meanwhile, some distinguished French writers had endeavored to oppose 
the anti-religious tendency of the day, and to build systems of thought 
in harmony with the spiritualistic doctrines of the Catholic Church. 
Joseph de Maistre, Victor de Bonald and F&eacute;licit&eacute; de 
Lamennais sincerely sought a new method by which Christian beliefs 
might be saved and impiety checked. Unhappily, they endeavored to build 
a monument to faith upon the ruins of reason. The ultimate criterion of 
certitude they sought in a primitive revelation. But as the truth of 
this revelation could not rest upon our mental faculties, which had 
been proclaimed impotent, it had no sure basis and the brave effort of 
the traditionalists was doomed to become in the end a lamentable 
failure. Traditionalism was finally condemned by the Church, and, in 
1855, its last great representative, Bonnetty, was compelled to 
subscribe to four propositions opposed to the errors he had 
maintained.<p> 

It is in such circumstances that the Catholic Church seriously
thought of returning to the old Scholastic doctrine. An honest
endeavor to seek the true philosophy in modern systems had been
made for several centuries. But, from a Catholic standpoint,
this endeavor had completely failed. The systems which had
arisen in the course of time had been gradually abandoned and
replaced by others, so that, as pointed out by Cornoldi, there
had been a continuous change in the speculative world. The
most recent systems, Materialism, Kantism, Hegelianism, 
Positivism, were opposed to the Catholic faith. The influence of
these systems had led many Catholics to advance dangerous
theories. A system born of the laudable intention to protect
the religious ideals had been a decided failure. Such being the
case, was it not better to return frankly to the philosophy which
had reigned for centuries in the schools, to endeavor to reconcile
it with modern discoveries, to find out whether the old Scholastic 
philosophy was not the true system which, for so long a
time, had been sought in vain? Such is, in my judgment, the
fundamental idea which inspired the neo-Thomists.<p>
