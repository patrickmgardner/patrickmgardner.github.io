The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter XIII: The Neo-Scholastic Revival in Belgium</h1><hr><p>

Ontologism, or the doctrine of the direct intuition of the
Deity, was the system in vogue in Belgian philosophic circles by
the middle of the nineteenth century.  Ubaghs's philosophy, as
is well known, is directly inspired by Malebranche, whose principles
it faithfully reproduces.  Similar beliefs were professed
by Ubaghs's co-workers at the University of Louvain:  Laforet,
Claessens and Moeller.<p>

This tendency of Belgian thought did not, however, preserve
for a long time its original force.  After ontologism had been
condemned by the Church in 1861, Ubaghs's philosophy was
gradually abandoned, and a return to St. Thomas began to take
place.  Among the professors of the University of Louvain who
contributed to bring about this return let us mention Dupont, Bossu,
and Lefebvre.<p>

No man, however, worked more bravely for the final victory
of Scholasticism than the Dominican Lepidi, then prefect of
studies in the College of the Immaculate Conception of Louvain,
later professor at the Minerva in Rome.<p>

An Italian by birth, Lepidi belongs to Belgium by his philosophy,
not only because he wrote there his most important
works, but chiefly for the immense influence he exercised upon
Belgian thought by bringing about the downfall of Ontologism.<p>

A solid refutation of ontologism is indeed the work entitled
<i>Examen philosophico-theologicum de ontologismo.</i>  The author
not only shows that the theory of the Divine Vision is groundless,
but he proves that the passages from St. Augustine and
St. Thomas generally adduced by ontologists in support of their
views are not, when properly understood, favorable to ontologism.<p>

No less recommendable is Lepidi's <i>Elementa Philosophiae
christianae</i> (1875-79).  It contains a clear and methodic exposition
of Scholastic logic and metaphysics, and may be regarded
as one of the best contributions to neo-Scholastic literature written
previous to the encyclical <i>AEterni Patris.</i><p>

A distinguished worker of the first hour was also Van
Weddingen, chaplain of the court.  His first work, <i>Essai critique
sur la philosophie de saint Anselme</i> (1875), was crowned
by the Royal Academy of Brussels.  Proposed by Leo XIII to
teach philosophy in the University of Louvain, he declined the
offer, preferring to keep his functions at the court, but he powerfully
contributed by his writings to give to the Thomistic revival
a sure footing in Belgium.  Besides a commentary on the encyclical
<i>AEterni Patris,</i> in which he splendidly sets down the
program of neo-Thomism, and important treatises on St.
Anselm, Albert the Great and St. Thomas (cf. Bibliography),
Van Weddingen has given to neo-Scholastic literature an extensive
work, his <i>Essai d'introduction &agrave; l'&eacute;tude de la philosophie,</i>
which consists of no less than 900 pages quarto, and studies the
question of the objectivity of knowledge, a question to which
the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> has given a capital importance.<p>

The neo-Scholastic revival in Belgium has been chiefly fostered
by two great centers of learning:  the College of the Jesuits
of Louvain and the <i>Institut Sup&eacute;rieur de Philosophie.</i><p>

The most celebrated among Belgian Jesuits are De San,
Lahousse, Castelein, Van der Aa, and Carbonelle.<p>

Louis de San (1832-1904) is reputed as one of the most profound
thinkers the Society of Jesus has produced.  For more
than thirty years he taught philosophy and theology at Louvain.
His theological productions are numerous.  Unhappily, he has
contributed to philosophy a single volume on cosmology, one of
the four volumes of a work entitled:  <i>Institutiones metaphysicae
specialis,</i> which the learned Jesuit had in view, but never
completed.<p>

De San is thoroughly acquainted with modern philosophy.
He has mastered Spinoza and the German idealists.  He possesses
a remarkable knowledge of natural science, studies the
Scholastic cosmological theories in connection with the laws of
chemistry, and finds in chemistry itself the proof of the Thomistic
principles.<p>

Gustave Lahousse (born 1846) is less profound than De San
and less acquainted with modern philosophy.  His <i>Praelectiones</i>
at times even display a lack of logical method.  In his Cosmology,
for example, he first demonstrates the existence of bodies,
and next the objectivity of sensation.<p>

John Van der Aa (born 1843) is strictly Scholastic and
ignores many modern problems.  In his Logic he reduces induction
to syllogism.<p>

Much more modern in his method, much more familiar with
the spirit of our time, is Aug. Castelein (born 1840), whose
<i>Cours de Philosophie</i> (1887), and <i>Institutiones philosophiae
moralis et socialis</i> (1889) have been valuable contributions to
neo-Scholastic literature.  Unlike Van der Aa, he does not limit
himself to the classical Scholastic logic, but studies the inductive
process, and discusses the value of hypothesis and of experimental
methods.  In his <i>Psychology,</i> Fr. Castelein examines the
Scholastic teaching about the soul in connection with modern
physiological data.<p>

Ignatius Carbonelle (died 1889) is primarily a scientist.
Like Fr. Castelein, he tries to harmonize scientific discoveries
with the Scholastic principles.  His work <i>Les confins de la science
et de la philosophie</i> has been honored by several editions.
Carbonelle has directed the <i>Revue des Questions scientifiques,</i>
one of the most important Belgian publications.<p>

Although the Jesuit College is thus an important center of
neo-Thomism, the city of Louvain is justly proud of another
center incomparably more important, of a center which has
raised neo-Thomism to an immense height, has transformed its
character and method, giving it a new life, bringing it into contact
with modern progress and modern ideals.  It is the <i>Institut
Sup&eacute;rieur de Philosophie</i> of the University.<p>

The peculiar character which distinguishes the Institute of
Louvain from earlier centers of Thomism is chiefly due to the
initiative of its first president, Desir&eacute; Mercier.<p>

Born in Braine l'Alleud (Belgium) in 1851, Desir&eacute; Mercier
began his studies in the seminary of Malines, and completed
them in the University of Louvain.  He was subsequently given
the chair of philosophy in the seminary of Malines.  This was
precisely the time in which Leo XIII, having been elected pope,
was promoting in Italy the revival of Scholasticism.  Cornoldi
was then giving his famous course, silencing all opponents with
the authority of St. Thomas, resolving all scientific doubts by
the <i>Summa Theologica.</i><p>

Leo XIII who, when a young man, had inhabited Belgium as
a papal nuncio, and had kept of that country the most delightful
remembrance, was trying to make the neo-Thomistic revival step
beyond the limits of Italy, to create in some other country an
institution similar to the Roman College, to the Cornoldi school.
Nowhere could he find a more favorable ground than in Belgium.
By the brief of the twenty-fifth of December, 1880,
addressed to Cardinal Deschamps, archbishop of Malines, the
pope urgently recommended the foundation of a chair of Thomistic
philosophy in the University of Louvain.  So great was
then the renown of the young professor Mercier, so successfully
had he fulfilled in Malines his professorial duties, that he was
chosen to carry the papal designs into effect.<p>

The success was great.  It did not, however, satisfy the pope,
who understood that something still greater could be done.  A
few years later -- the eleventh of July, 1888 -- Leo XIII sent a
second brief to the archbishop of Malines, Cardinal Goossens,
recommending the foundation of an institute of Thomistic philosophy,
endowed with its own independent life.  Having
learned that the greatest difficulty was the lack of funds, he sent
to Cardinal Goossens the sum of 150,000 francs.  Great was the
energy displayed by the Belgian Catholics to realize the papal
ideals.  Their efforts were finally crowned with success, and in
1891 the Institute of Philosophy of Louvain, the glory of neo-
Thomism, was officially created.<p>

In a memoir read before the Congress of Catholics held in
Malines in September, 1891, Mercier traced the program he had
in view to insure the success of the new foundation.  After
representing and deploring the isolation from the rest of the
scientific world to which Catholics had condemned themselves, he
outlined the reforms he contemplated, the new road he intended to
open to neo-Scholasticism.<p>

The reforms which characterized the school of Louvain may
be classified under two heads:<p>

1.  Philosophy was not to be regarded as a mere <i>ancilla
theologiae,</i> but to be studied for philosophy's sake.  Catholic
philosophers would thus frankly enter into the spirit of our time, and
cease to be looked upon as mere apologists of their Creed.<p>

2.  Just as philosophy was to be studied for its own sake, so
also was science.  Neo-Thomists had to become true scientists,
to construct laboratories, to make experiments, and -- this was
the point which at first savored of paradox -- to find in St.
Thomas himself the reconciliation of science and, philosophy.<p>

This last ambition was not novel.  It was the very aim Cornoldi
had cherished many years before, the very spirit which had
inspired the encyclical <i>AEterni Patris,</i> but thus far nothing
serious had been done.<p>

Mercier proposed:  first of all, to study St. Thomas in his
original works, to open the <i>Summa Theologica,</i> the <i>Summa
contra Gentiles,</i> the <i>Opuscula Philosophica,</i> the
<i>Commentaria in Aristoteles.</i>  It was thus found that a great many
opinions which, for centuries, had been ridiculed under the name of
Thomism, were not from St. Thomas, but from writers of the
time of the Renaissance, from Newton or Gassendi.  It was
found that Aristotle and St. Thomas were not dogmatic idealists
constructing the world <i>a priori,</i> but true scientists, who based
their philosophy upon the facts of experience; that their doctrines
were not antiquated and useless theories, but possessed a
character of modernness which many recent systems might envy.<p>

Modern philosophers were likewise to be studied in their original
works.  Descartes and Kant were not to be reached any
longer via Sanseverino.  The <i>Discourse on Method</i> and the
<i>Critique of Pure Reason,</i> were to be read and understood.  Thus
and thus only could the spirit of modern philosophy be grasped;
thus only could neo-Thomism keep abreast with the rest of the
learned world.<p>

The success of the Institute of Louvain has been prodigious.
Mgr. Mercier has found at first many opponents among Catholics,<A HREF="perrierg.html#XIII1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a>
but he has always answered victoriously.  The numerous
articles on neo-Thomism which, since the foundation of the
Institute, have appeared in the <i>Kantstudien,</i> the
</i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Psychologie und Physiologie,</i> the <i>Revue
Philosophique,</i> the <i>Rivista Filosofica,</i> and many other
publications, show how well he has succeeded in breaking the studied
silence with which the Thomistic revival had been previously received.<p>

The Institute of Louvain, so successful in point of philosophy,
has also obtained significant results in the field of science.  At
the head of the department of science is Mr. Thi&eacute;ry, a former
pupil of the famous Wundt, of Leipzig.  About the laboratory
he has founded in Louvain, Mr. Binet could write in the <i>Ann&eacute;e
Psychologique</i> of 1896:  "For the course of Mr. Thi&eacute;ry there
is a laboratory and complete equipment for physiological psychology
such as does not exist at present in all France."  A similar
laboratory has been subsequently founded at the Sorbonne
(Hautes-Etudes).<p>

Under the direction of Mgr. Mercier, a Course of Philosophy
has been published to which Mercier himself has contributed the
volumes on <i>Logic, Criteriology, General Metaphysics,</i> and
<i>Psychology.</i>  Less extensive than the <i>Institutiones</i> of
Urraburu, Mercier's Course is much more modern.  It discards questions
which in our day may be dismissed as useless, and studies scientific
results in themselves, without giving, at the head of each
chapter, a decision of the Councils or a passage from the Sacred
Scriptures, with which the data of science must be forced into
harmony.<p>

The success of the  <i>"Cours de Philosophie"</i> of the Institute
is eloquently testified by the numerous editions which have been
made in a few years, and the translations into German, Italian,
Spanish, Portuguese and Polish by which it has been honored.<p>

The Catholic Church has not been indifferent to the great
service done by Mercier to the cause of neo-Thomism.  The
illustrious founder of the Institute of Louvain has been offered
in 1906 the archiepiscopal see of Malines.  Quite recently
(April 18, 1907) he has been made a cardinal.<p>

The arduous task that lay before Mercier in 1891 has been
greatly facilitated by the action of distinguished collaborators
who at once grasped the program of their master and imbibed
his spirit.  Conspicuous among them is the illustrious historian
of Mediaeval philosophy, Mr. de Wulf.<p>

Maurice de Wulf (born 1867) was already known before his
appointment at Louvain by a historical work:  <i>Histoire de la
philosophie scolastique dans les Pays-Bas et la Principaut&eacute; de
Li&egrave;ge,</i> which had been crowned by the Royal Academy of Belgium.
Since then he has written numerous works or essays, of
which the most important are:  a <i>History of Mediaeval Philosophy</i>
(1900), which is perhaps the most valuable book we possess
on the subject, and an <i>Introduction &agrave; la Philosophie neo-
scolastique,</i> published in 1904.<p>

In his <i>Histoire de la Philosophie M&eacute;di&eacute;vale,</i> Mr. de Wulf
departs from the common view which identifies Scholasticism
with Mediaeval philosophy, and discovers in the Middle Ages
two antithetical currents:   Scholasticism proper, represented by
Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Albert the Great, etc.; and anti-
Scholasticism, of which Scotus Erigena is the father, and which
is continued by the Catharists, the Albigenses and the Pantheistic
schools.  Mr. de Wulf's view on this point has not met with
a ready acceptance.  It has been rejected, among others, by Elie
Blanc and Picavet.  Mr. de Wulf, however, still holds the same
opinion, and has defended it again in his <i>Introduction &agrave; la
Philosophie N&eacute;o scolastique.</i><p>

The aim of this last work is to remove current misconceptions
about the nature of Scholastic philosophy; to give, as in a nutshell,
the essential traits of Thomism, and to show to what extent
neo-Scholasticism agrees with the Scholasticism of the Middle
Ages, and to what extent the old philosophy has been modified.
In no other work is the program of neo-Scholasticism, so definitely
outlined.  The study of Mr. de Wulf's Introduction is
indispensable to those who want to enter the field of neo-Scholastic
literature.<p>

With the collaboration of Mr. A. Pelzer, Mr. de Wulf has
lately undertaken the publication of unedited works of Mediaeval
Belgian philosophers.  Among the volumes already published
let us mention: <i>Le Trait&eacute; De Unitate Formoe de Gilles de
Lessines</i> (1901), <i>Les Quatres Premiers Quolibets de Godefroid de
Fontaines</i> (1904).<p>

Mr. D. Nys is the cosmologist of the Institute.  Besides two
volumes dealing with St. Thomas's conception of time and space,
and many articles published in the <i>Revue N&eacute;o-Scolastique,</i> he
has contributed to the <i>Cours de Philosophie</i> of the Institute the
volume on Cosmology.<p>

In no other work -- safe perhaps in Farges's essays -- are the
Scholastic theories about the world so satisfactorily expounded.
Nys's Cosmology is even more scientific than Farges's works on
the subject.  All modern discoveries, all recent scientific results
are discussed in connection with the Scholastic system.  We may
fail to agree with Mr. Nys's conclusions -- and I confess that this
is my case -- but we cannot entertain for a single instant the
idea that his conclusions are not the result of a serious study
of the matter.<p>

Among the men who have honored the Institute of Louvain
by their philosophical productions we must also mention:<p>

L. Noel, who has written valuable works on the question of
Determinism and free will.<p>

Simon Deploige, professor of economics and political science,
who has published a treatise on the Thomistic theory of property
and a most interesting essay entitled, <i>St. Thomas et la question
juive;</i> and E. Crahay, author of a work dealing with St.
Thomas's political doctrines.<p>

Finally, the Institute of Louvain deserves the gratitude of
all lovers of philosophy by the publication of one of the most
interesting and learned reviews Actually existing, the <i>Revue
N&eacute;o-Scolastique,</i> whose pages are of immense service, not only
to those interested in neo-Scholasticism, but to all students of
philosophy.<p>
