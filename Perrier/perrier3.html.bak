The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter III: Scholastic Metaphysics</h1><hr><p>

<b><a name="1">SECTION</a> 1. -- EXISTENCE OF METAPHYSICS</b><p>

The word Metaphysics was unknown to Aristotle. It is probably
due to Andronicus of Rhodes, a compiler of Aristotle's
works, who was unable to reduce the fourteen books actually
known as Metaphysics either to ethics, logic or physics.  The
word had therefore originally no intended meaning beyond a
classificatory purpose.  Very soon, however, its connotation
underwent a change and was taken to be, not what merely comes
after, but what is essentially above physics.  St. Thomas brings
the two meanings together in the following words:  "This science
is called metaphysics because its study follows the study
of physics, as we are naturally inclined to pass from sensible to
supersensible things."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a><p>

General Metaphysics, also called Ontology, has often been
defined by neo-Scholasties as:  the science of Being in general,
or of Being as Being.  This definition has been opposed by
Mgr. Mercier on the ground that the notion of being in general
is analogical, and covers a multitude of things with which
ontology has nothing to do.  It embraces objects of totally
diverse natures, such as substances and accidents.  It even
extends to the logical being.  Now, the logical being has its
proper place in logic.  As for accident, it is not studied in
metaphysics except in so far as it is related to substance.  The
proper object of metaphysics, according to Mercier, is thus real
being or substance.  Metaphysics is not concerned with what
Hegel calls "Pure Being," and shows to be equal to nothing.
It's vital problem, as Mr. Woodbridge points out, is the nature
or c~haracter of reality,<A HREF="perrierg.html#III2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a> and accident and logical being come
within its field only in so far as they are regarded as real.<p>

Scholastic metaphysics has met, in modern times, with powerful
adversaries who have tried, not only to deprive her of the
sovereignty which, as queen of the sciences, she had so long
exercised, but to banish her altogether from the world of
thought.  She who, for centuries, had seen the most powerful
geniuses prostrate at her feet, has been driven out, without
mercy, from the field of human speculation.  She has lingered
for a long time, as an outlaw, in some obscure corner of her
former realm, and to-day she reappears more resplendent than
ever, and dares meet her old foes face to face.<p>

The two great currents of thought which have rejected metaphysics
as vain in its object and erroneous in its conclusions are
Positivism and Kantism.<p>

According to Auguste Comte, the attempt to grasp the essences
of things is a futile endeavor.  We cannot go beyond
actual facts and laws of facts.  Identical are the views of Herbert
Spencer.  For him, our knowledge is limited to appearances,
and the reality lying behind those appearances is and
must be unknown.<A HREF="perrierg.html#III3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a><p>

Positivism thus rejects metaphysics, is even bound to reject
it.  A philosophy which professes not to step beyond the facts
of sensible experience cannot reach the universal nature which
is the object of all metaphysical speculation.  It should even
abandon all attempts at expressing the laws of facts, and be
contented with the immediate, with the "this," which is the
only thing devoid of all metaphysical element.<p>

Kant, whose aim was to combat Hume's scepticism and thus
to save metaphysics from utter destruction, has perhaps dealt
her the most severe blows.  He has taught that our knowledge
is conditioned by our natural faculties, and that the reality
which we see through the forms of sensibility and the categories
of understanding is necessarily distorted by these subjective conditions
and never appears to us as it is in itself.  It is phenomena that we know.
The noumenon, the thing-in-itself, is absolutely
unknowable.  A science professing to deal with reality as
it is becomes therefore meaningless and absurd.<p>

Both Kantians and Positivists labor under the same misconception.
All facts of experience have come to be divided into
two great classes.  Some are known as real, others as apparent.
We have observed that a stick which looks straight in ordinary
conditions looks crooked when immersed in water.  As our sense
of touch does, not in this case corroborate the conclusions of our
visual experience, we conclude that no real change has taken
place in the stick itself, that it is still really straight, but appears
crooked.<p>

This division is swallowed up by all defenders of the absolute
relativity of knowledge.  They undo, as it were, the work of
experience, and leave us at our starting-point, where we cannot
escape the necessity of beginning our work over again.  It
reality lies altogether beyond our reach, it is as non-existent
for us, and the appearances, the phenomena with which alone
we have to deal, become the only possible object of research, the
only reality.  With them a new metaphysics must needs arise,
which, upon close examination, will be found to be exactly the
one we have rejected.<p>

The positivistic and the Kantian positions are thus untenable.
They are also illogical.  Both positivists and Kantians reach
conclusions that are metaphysical in themselves and unattainable
without the help of metaphysics.  They assert, for example,
that all knowledge is relative and that reality is absolutely unknowable.
This is a conclusion about the nature of reality
itself, a conclusion which in so far is metaphysical.  And if we
go on saying with Spencer that the unknowable force lying
beyond our experience is the cause of our sense-impressions, or,
with Kant, that the thing-in-itself is the necessary condition of
the existence of the phenomenal world, if we know and describe
the effects which the absolute reality produces, we thereby profess
to know a good deal about this reality, and can hardly
describe it as absolutely unknowable.<p>
<p>

<b><a name="2">SECTION</a> 2. -- SCHOLASTIC THEORY OF ACT AND POTENCY</b><p>

One of the most enlightened among neo-Scholastics, Mr.
Albert Farges, regards the doctrine of Act and Potency as the
foundation-stone of the peripapetic and Thomistic metaphysics.
"La theorie de l'acte et de la puissance, du moteur et du mobile
est la clef de vo&ucirc;te de tout ce gigantesque &eacute;difice &eacute;lev&eacute; &agrave; la
gloire de la philosophie spiritualiste par le g&eacute;nie d'Aristote et
de saint Thomas d'Aquin."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a>  This doctrine has been, however,
so often derided in modern times that Mr. Farges's words will
it first savor of paradox.  The Scholastics have been accused of
introducing into their philosophy mysterious entities, occult
causes, and of moving thereby, in the most strange way, as by
means of invisible threads, the whole machinery of the world.
In order to remove all possible prejudices, it will be well,
before proceeding to explain the theory of Act and Potency, to
quote the opinion of two men who are certainly not biased in
favor of Scholasticism.  The first of them is Mr. Vacherot.
Speaking of the peripatetic philosophy, he expresses himself
thus:<p>

"It is the school of Aristotle especially, which is a school of
science and of positive philosophy. . . . Nothing is less speculative
than his philosophy, if the term speculative is meant for
a priori conception. . . . The whole doctrine of Aristotle rests
upon a formula, which is the most abstract and the highest expression
of experience:  Potency and Act, two words which sum
up his thought and explain everything."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III5"><SUP>[5]</sup></a><p>

Mr. Boutroux likewise, although a sincere Kantian, not only
does full justice to Aristotle, but seems to prefer his teaching
to the doctrine of Kant himself.  He recognizes that Aristotle's
philosophy answers particularly to the scientific preoccupations
of our time, "r&eacute;pond particuli&egrave;rement aux pr&eacute;occupations scientifiques
de notre &eacute;poque."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III6"><SUP>[6]</sup></a><p>

The exposition of the doctrine of Act and Potency demands,
as an indispensable prerequisite, an analysis of the concept of
motion.<p>

The existence of motion or change was denied by the Old
Eleatic school.  It is said that Aristotle, in answer to certain
sophists of his time, who endeavored to revive Parmendides's and
Zeno's arguments, simply began to walk.  This answer, so trivial
in appearance, was as profound and irrefutable as could be.  It
meant that motion is a fact of our experience, and cannot be
denied, because it is there and constantly forces itself upon us.
Should it even be said that all movements and changes are
deceitful appearances and that reality is immutable, one is compelled
to admit that those appearances are still there, are real
and must be explained.<p>

Aristotle, in his <i>Physics,</i> distinguishes three classes of
movement:  a movement purely local or of translation; a change in
quality, which he calls alteration; a change in quantity, or
development and reduction of mass.<A HREF="perrierg.html#III7"><SUP>[7]</sup></a><p>

Movement is thus understood in a broad sense and cannot be
identified with local motion.  Change of place is rather an effect
of motion than motion itself.  The essence of motion rather consists,
to use Farges's words, in a tendency, a becoming, an instrument
of evolution for the material forces of nature, "une tendance,
un devenir, un instrument d'&eacute;volution pour les fources
mat&eacute;rielles de la nature."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III8"><SUP>[8]</sup></a><p>

Now, the changes we observe in our universe do not take place
at random, but according to definite laws.  Whenever an object
is placed in determinate conditions, it begins to act in such a<p>

way as to show that it possesses a peculiar nature, that it is a
unique individual.  In other words, we are bound to admit the
existence of purpose in our world.  The word purpose has now
come to mean a conscious scheme.  It has been identified with
design.  The old Scholastics did not hesitate to use it in a
broader sense.  They spoke of <i>intentio naturtae</i>or <i>appetitus
naturalis</i> to designate the unconscious tendencies of lower
beings.<A HREF="perrierg.html#III9"><SUP>[9]</sup></a><p>

When we say that our universe is purposive, we do not therefore
mean that it is made according to a plan; that it is designed
by a supreme being who directs everything to his ends, who,
hidden behind the scenes, moves the whole mechanism.  Our
world may be thus designed, it is true, but this is not the question
now.  We only mean that the individuals of our world are
controlled by their own character, that they naturally tend to a
definite result.  We may thus consider in each individual two
different states:  the one in which it is still undeveloped,
determinable, has not acquired the full perfection it naturally tends
to; the other in which it is already determined, perfected, has
reached its final goal.  The first of these states is called potential
by the Scholastics, the second actual.  A potential being is
thus an imperfect, but perfectible being.  An actual being is a
being already perfected.  The acorn is potentially an oak.<p>

No mysterious assumption, I believe, is needed to reach these
conclusions.  Potentiality is not an occult cause existing behind
the acorn and acting upon it in some unthinkable manner; it is
the peculiar character which the acorn possesses as an individual,
and by which it is distinguished from all other individuals, the
property which enables it to become an oak and nothing else.
It may be impossible to tell beforehand the nature of the actuality
toward which a potential being tends.  A microscopical
examination of the acorn will not show us anything resembling
an oak.  An analysis of the potential will not give us the actual.
It is the actual itself that will evince the potentialities of the
being which gave it birth.  The very fact, however, that the<p>

acorn, and the acorn alone, becomes an oak, compels
us to admit that the acorn possesses some individual properties
which a pea does not possess, that it contains potentially an oak,
while the pea does not.  Nothing further than this do the Scholastics
maintain.<p>

We are now in a position to understand Aristotle's famous
definition of motion as "the act of the potential being as
potential."<p>

Between the purely potential state of the being which is not
as yet tending towards an end, and its final condition after the
end is reached, there are intermediate stages. The new-born
child is potentially a Kantian philosopher, although he has not
yet done anything towards an insight of the Kantian theory.
Between the state of his mind then and its final condition when
the three Critiques are adequately grasped, a long period of
time will probably elapse.  There will be the university stage,
in which the young student will learn with amazement that
space is in his mind, the following years of struggle against a
thought strange in itself and untowardly presented, epochs of
failure and discouragement, epochs of partial success.<p>

The new-born child possesses the Kantian philosophy potentially;
the full-grown philosopher who has mastered the three
Critiques possesses it actually; the university student is in a
state of movement.<p>

Motion is thus an act of the potential being; an act, because
the potential being which is merely potential does not yet tend
towards its end, is not yet in motion; an act of the potential
being, because if the being is already actual, has completed its
evolutionary process, it is not in motion any longer.  Motion is
an act, but an imperfect act; an act which has not yet reached
its full degree of actuality, and is now completing itself.<p>

<b><a name="3">SECTION</a> 3. -- SCHOLASTIC THEORY OF SUBSTANCE</b><p>

The simplest observation upon the objects of our experience,
shows that they may be divided into two great classes.  Some,
as a horse, a tree, a man, we conceive as existing by themselves.
Others, as walking, cannot exist but in something else.  The
former are called substances by the Scholastics; the second, accidents,
qualities, attributes.  Scholastic philosophy thus defines
substance as that which exists by itself; accident as that which
cannot exist by itself, but always exists in something else.<p>

The etymology of the word substance (<i>substantia</i>) involves,
it is true, a different meaning.  It evokes the idea of a substratum,
of some sort of recipient in which the attributes inhere.
But, as we have elsewhere remarked, the etymology of a word
does not always give us the key to its actual meaning.  In our
epoch of religious liberty, a Protestant may spend his whole life
without actually protesting against any religious dogma.  He
still calls himself and really is a Protestant.<p>

No doubt the accidents, being unable to exist by themselves,
exist in something else; and substance may be thus correctly
described as that which supports accidents.  This is not, however,
the primary meaning of the word substance, which strictly
signifies that which exists by itself.<p>

Before we proceed to a more detailed study of the concepts
of substance and accident, it will be worth while to examine
some of the modern theories which have rejected the term substance
altogether, or have modified its meaning so as to render
it unrecognizable.<p>

Of the adversaries of substance, John Locke must head the
list.  Not because he is an open foe.  He hesitates, feels dissatisfied
with his bellicose attitude, would fain come to a compromise.
But all the subsequent and more resolute adversaries
have been at his school.  It is his principles they follow; it is
in his workshop they have found their most dreadful weapons.<p>

Like many modern philosophers, John Locke regards substance
as a support for accidents.  It is from this point of view
that he aims his missiles, so that, to a certain extent, he constantly
misses the mark:<p>

"They who first ran into the notion of accidents as a sort of
real beings that needed something to inhere in," says he, "were
forced to find out the word substance to support them.  Had the
poor Indian philosopher (who imagined that the earth also
wanted something to bear it up), but thought of this word substance,
he needed not to have been at the trouble to find an elephant
to support it, and a tortoise to support the elephant:  the
word substance would have done it effectually."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III10"><SUP>[10]</sup></a><p>

He consequently asserts that we have no clear idea of substance:<p>

"We have no such clear idea at all, and therefore signify
nothing by the word substance, but only an uncertain supposition
of we know not what, <i>i. e.</i> (of something whereof we have
no particular distinct positive) idea, which we take to be the
substratum, or support, of those ideas we know."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III11"><SUP>[11]</sup></a><p>

(Let us parenthetically point out a somewhat unexpected
metamorphosis.  We had believed substance to be a support of
accidents.  We are now told it is a support of ideas.  Our
author seems willing to prove by all possible means the truth
of his assertion that he has no clear idea of substance.)<p>

Let us not, however, misunderstand Locke.  He would by no
means maintain that we are in absolute ignorance as to what
substances are; he even positively asserts that we have a real
knowledge of them.  But he adds the restricting clause that this
knowledge does not go very far:<p>

"Herein therefore is founded the reality of our knowledge
concerning substances, that all our complex ideas of them must
be such, and such only, as are made up of such simple ones as
have been discovered to co-exist in nature.  And our ideas being
thus true, though not perhaps very exact copies, are yet the subject
of real (as far as we have any) knowledge of them; which
(as has been already shown) will not be found to reach very far;
but so far as it does, it will still be real knowledge."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III12"><SUP>[12]</sup></a><p>

Our knowledge of substance, which had been described as
"nothing but an uncertain supposition of we know not what,"
is now confessed to be a real knowledge, as real as any knowledge
we may have, and Locke's opponents may doubt whether
his attacks were not merely the mock-fight of a stage performer.
He will presently throw his weapons away, and we will hardly
be able to repress a smile on reading the following terms of
surrender:<p>

"It is of the idea alone I speak here, and not of the being
of substance.  And having everywhere affirmed and built upon
it, that a man is a substance, I cannot be supposed to question
or doubt of the being of substance, till I can question or doubt
of my own being."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III13"><SUP>[13]</sup></a><p>

David Hume is, or tries to be, more consistent than his master.
His rejection of substance seems at first sight well grounded
and unanswerable, and has deserved him the credit of having
delivered philosophy from a cumbersome and useless conception,
of having done away with the soul-substance itself, as Berkeley
had done with the bodily substance.<p>

Hume's attack on ancient philosophy is a sharp attack indeed.
He is careful, however, before engaging in the struggle, to tell
us -- with a certain naivet&eacute;--that he does not understand ancient
philosophy at all. " The whole system, says he, is entirely
incomprehensible."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III14"><SUP>[14]</sup></a>  Now, it is perhaps too much to say that a
system of philosophy is not understood until it is believed; but
it cannot be denied that a system of philosophy is not understood
until belief in it seems at least possible.  Artistotle was a man
whose mental shrewdness Hume certainly did not surpass, who
devoted his whole life to study as earnestly as Hume did, who
lived in a country not inferior as regards civilization to Hume's
own country, who moved in a more intellectual atmosphere, who
breathed a purer air.  The system of philosophy Aristotle contrived
was undoubtedly plain in his own mind.  If it appears
entirely incomprehensible to Hume, it simply means that Hume
does not understand it as Aristotle did, does not, in point of fact,
understand it at all.<p>

For Hume, as for Locke, substance is primarily a kind of
substratum, something unknown and invisible, which continues
the same amid all variations:<p>

"In order to reconcile which contradictions the imagination
is apt to feign something unknown and invisible, which it supposes
to continue the same under all these variations; and this
unintelligible something it calls a substance, or original and
first matter."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III15"><SUP>[15]</sup></a><p>

But as, according to him, all qualities (such as the color, taste,
flgure, solidity, etc., of a melon) may be conceived as distinct
and separate, they do not need any support, and substance becomes
an unintelligible chimera:<p>

"Every quality being a distinct thing from another, may be
conceived to exist apart, and may exist apart, not only from
every other quality, but from that unintelligible chimera of a
substance."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III16"><SUP>[16]</sup></a><p>

Hume is decidedly a most interesting man.  After devoting
all his energies to drive away the notion of substance from the
field of philosophy, he reduces to naught, by stroke of pen, his
elaborate work, and presents to his amazed reader the following
statement:<p>

"If any one should evade the difficulty by saying that the
definition of a substance is something which may exist by itself;
and that this definition ought to satisfy us:  Should this be said,
I should observe, that this definition agrees to everything that,
can possibly be conceived; and never will serve to distinguish
substance from accident, or the soul from its perceptions."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III17"><SUP>[17]</sup></a><p>

That substance is something existing by itself is indeed the
only thing the supporters of the idea of substance maintain; and
Hume, unconsciously, unwillingly perhaps, becomes one of their
number.  There is, it is true, in his statement, an inadmissible
element of which I will speak in the sequel; but the fundamental
principle it contains is in perfect harmony with the doctrine for
which the supporters of the existence of substance contend.<p>

A few more words before dismissing Hume.  Substances have
generally been divided into bodily and mental.  Berkeley is commonly
supposed to have done away with bodily substances;
Hume, with mental substances.  This view must be qualified.
Hume acknowledges that he believes in bodies -- that is to say, in
bodily substances -- and thus seems to go one step backwards, to
destroy Berkeley's elaborate work:<p>

"We may well ask," says he, "What causes induce us to believe
in the existence of body? but it is vain to ask, Whether there
be body or not?  That is a point which we must take for granted
in all our reasonings."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III18"><SUP>[18]</sup></a><p>

As regards mind, it is true that he resolves it into a heap or
collection of perceptions:<p>

"Mind," he says, "is nothing but a heap or collection of different
perceptions, united together by certain relations, and supposed,
though falsely, to be endowed with a perfect simplicity
and identity."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III19"><SUP>[19]</sup></a><p>

Which means that there are perceptions, and there is no mind.<p>

But when, in reading the <i>Treatise on Human Nature,</i> we find
such expressions as these:<p>

"It will always be impossible to decide with certainty,
whether they (the impressions) arise immediately from the
object, or are produced by the creative power of the mind, or
are derived from the author of our being."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III20"><SUP>[20]</sup></a> . . . "Upon the
whole, necessity is something that exists in the mind, not in
objects."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III21"><SUP>[21]</sup></a>. . . "Impressions are naturally the most vivid perceptions
of the mind."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III22"><SUP>[22]</sup></a> . . . "The mind falls so easily from
the one perception to the other, that it scarce perceives the
change."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III23"><SUP>[23]</sup></a> . . . "We may pronounce any quality of the mind
virtuous which causes love or pride."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III24"><SUP>[24]</sup></a> . . . "When I perceive
the causes of any emotion, my mind is conveyed to the effects,
and is actuated with a like emotion."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III25"><SUP>[25]</sup></a> . . . "It being almost
impossible for the mind to change its character in any considerable
article, or cure itself of a passionate or splenetic temper,
when they are natural to it,"<A HREF="perrierg.html#III26"><SUP>[26]</sup></a><p>

we feel strangely perplexed as to what Hume's meaning really
is.  It sounds odd to speak of states of mind if there is no mind.
The words I, our, us, themselves become meaningless if perceptions
alone are and we are not.<p>

These considerations may give us some suspicion as to the
real worth of Hume's famous rejection of substance.  They will
not perhaps induce us to proclaim with Rickaby that "the acceptance
of Hume's doctrine by so many of the philosophers in
England is a disgrace to the sound sense of the nation";<A HREF="perrierg.html#III27"><SUP>[27]</sup></a> but
they will compel us to study the conception of substance once
more, to examine whether the philosophy which advocates its
legitimacy is not, after all, the philosophy of truth.<p>

It would be useless to pass a review of the contemporary philosophers
who reject substance from their system.  They do
little more than adopting Hume's principles and repeating his
arguments.  Those among our university professors who have
not yet come back to Aristotle's point of view simply tell us in
their own words what Hume said long ago.  The <i>Treatise on
Human Nature</i> is their profession of faith.<p>

There is one contemporary writer, however, who deserves to
be singled out from the throng, and whose philosophy will detain
us for a moment.  I speak of John Stuart Mill.<p>

Mill accepts the common division of substances into bodies
and minds.  He defines a body as "the external cause to which
we ascribe our sensation";<A HREF="perrierg.html#III28"><SUP>[28]</sup></a> a mind as "the unknown recipient,
or percipient of them."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III29"><SUP>[29]</sup></a>  At the first blush, this seems very
clear; but, unlike many other writers, Mill possesses the peculiarity
of appearing clear at a first reading and less clear when
we read him again; and, strange to say, the more we read him,
the obscurer he becomes.  At one place, he tells us that,<p>

"as we know not, and cannot know anything of bodies but the
sensations which they excite in us or in others, these sensations
must be all that we can at bottom mean by their attributes, and
the distinction which we verbally make between the properties
of things and the sensations we receive from them must originate
in the convenience of discourse rather than in the nature
of what is denoted by the terms"<A HREF="perrierg.html#III30"><SUP>[30]</sup></a><p>

at another place, that<p>

"a sensation is to be carefully distinguished from the object
which causes the sensation; our sensation of white from a white
object; nor is it less to be distinguished from the attribute
whiteness, which we ascribe to the object in consequence of its
exciting the sensation."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III31"><SUP>[31]</sup></a><p>

Here, after explaining that a cause does not as such resemble
its effects, that an east wind is not like the feeling of cold, nor
heat like the steam of boiling water, that matter therefore does
not necessarily resemble our sensations, he concludes that<p>

"it may be safely laid down as a truth both obvious in itself,
and admitted by all whom it is at present necessary to take into
consideration,that, of the outward world, we know and can
know absolutely nothing, except the sensations which we experience
from it";<A HREF="perrierg.html#III32"><SUP>[32]</sup></a><p>

and a little further he criticizes Locke for admitting<p>

"real essences, or essences of individual objects, which he supposed
to be the causes of the sensible properties of those
objects."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III33"><SUP>[33]</sup></a><p>

Mill's conception of substance is thus far from being clear.
There is, however, one point which he has perfectly grasped.
He admits that substance is primarily that which exists by itself:<p>

"An attribute," says he, "must be the attribute of something:
color, for example, must be the color of something; and if this
something should cease to exist, or should cease to be connected
with the attribute, the existence of the attribute would be at an
end.  A substance, on the contrary, is self-existant:  in speaking
about it, we need not put of after its name.  A stone is not the
stone of anything; the moon is not the moon of anything, but
simply the moon."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III34"><SUP>[34]</sup></a><p>

It is not easy to see why Mill, criticizing this conception, finds
in it lessons of English, Greek, Latin or German, rather than
of mental philosophy.  When we say that a color is the color
of something and that the moon is not the moon of anything,
we do not apparently use meaningless words.  We speak about
the real objects of our world, and describe them just as our
experience presents them to us.  As we never find in nature a
color existing by itself, and we find a moon existing by itself,
we feel compelled -- not by the necessity of our language, but by
the necessity of the kind of reality we have got -- to speak of a
color as a color of something, and to speak of the moon as simply
the moon.  It is reality which obliges us to distinguish a
substance from an attribute, to ascribe to the former a character
which the latter does not possess.<p>

Mill, however, tries to corroborate his views by the following
argument:<p>

"As for the self-existence of substances, it is very true that
a substance may be conceived to exist without any other substance,
but so also may an attribute be conceived to exist without
any other attribute; and we can no more imagine a substance
without attributes than we can imagine attributes without a
substance."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III35"><SUP>[35]</sup></a><p>

This reasoning seems obvious enough; and, when expressed in
the antithetical language used by Mill, may even appear convincing.
A little consideration, however, shows that it lies
under a great confusion of ideas.  If the clause "an attribute
may exist without any other attribute" simply means that an
agreeable odor may be indifferently joined to a red or to a blue
color, it is undoubtedly true, but does not amount to much.  If,
on the contrary, it means that an attribute may exist by itself,
without any other conjoined attribute, it must simply be denied
on the ground that it involves a contradiction, inasmuch as the
being thus described would not be an attribute, but a substance.<p>

There is no doubt that we can no more imagine a substance
without attributes than attributes without a substance.  The
attributes are the very elements of the substance, so that a substance
without attributes would mean a substance without elements,
or, in other words, a thing which would be equal to nothing.
But the self-existence of a substance does not and cannot
mean that it exists without attributes.  It means that it exists
by itself, while the attribute does not; and herein lies the essential
difference between them.<p>

Some philosophers, while admitting the validity of the concept
of substance, have given more or less inadequate definitions
of it.  Descartes identifies substance with extension or thought;
Leibniz, with activity.  For Kant, the distinguishing character
of substance is permanence:  "In all changes of phenomena,
substance is permanent, and the quantum thereof in nature is
neither increased nor diminished."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III36"><SUP>[36]</sup></a>  This seems to be also the
view which Hegel tries to convey in his usual, attractive
language:<p>

"The necessary is in itself an absolute correlation of elements,
<i>i.e.,</i> the process developed (in the preceding paragraphs),
in which the correlation also suspends itself to absolute identity.
In its immediate form, it is the relationship of substance and
accident.  The absolute self-identity of this relationship is substance
as such, which as necessity gives the negative to this form
of inwardness, and thus invests itself with actuality, but which
also gives the negative to this outward thing.  In this negativity
the actual, as immediate, is only an accidental which through
this bare possibility passes over into another actuality.  This
transition is the identity of substance, regarded as form-
activity.<A HREF="perrierg.html#III37"><SUP>[37]</sup></a><p>

Finally, a few authors have believed that substance is essentially
a substratum, an unknowable something lying beyond the
accidents, and have thus justified, to a certain extent, the confusion
from which the thinkers who reject substance altogether
have derived their greatest strength.  Not otherwise is substance
defined by the celebrated Spanish philosopher, James Balmes.
He regards it as a substratum, "a thing which is no color, but
lends itself to all colors; which is none of the qualities which
we experience, but the subject and cause of them all";<A HREF="perrierg.html#III38"><SUP>[38]</sup></a> a permanent
substratum:<p>

"a permanent being in which occur the changes which are presented
to us in the sensible phenomena";<A HREF="perrierg.html#III39"><SUP>[39]</sup></a><p>

an unknowable substratum:<p>

"In vain you ask me, what is this being?  Give me the intuition
of the essence of corporeal things, and I will tell you; but
while I know them only by their effects, that is, the impressions
which they produce in me, I cannot answer you."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III40"><SUP>[40]</sup></a><p>

St. Thomas and the Scholastics, however, regard substance
primarily as that which exists by itself; and it is astonishing
that Balmes, who, for four years, read no other book than the
<i>Summa</i> of St. Thomas, saying that in it all truths are contained,
should have departed from his master in this important point.
St. Thomas says:<p>

"Substantia est res, cujus naturae debetur esse non in alio;
accidens vero est res, cujus naturae debetur esse in alio";<A HREF="perrierg.html#III41"><SUP>[41]</sup></a><p>

and further:<p>

"Illud proprie dicitur esse, quod habet ipsum esse, quasi in suo
esse subsistens.  Unde solae substantiae vere et proprie dicuntur
entia."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III42"><SUP>[42]</sup></a><p>

Neo-Scholastics universally adhere to this view, and are so far
from regarding substance as a support of accidents that some of
them describe God as a substance which exists by itself, and to
which no accidents are nor can be joined.<A HREF="perrierg.html#III43"><SUP>[43]</sup></a><p>

The Scholastic theory on this point is undoubtedly right.  We
cannot deny that experience presents us with two distinct classes
of objects:  some of which exist by themselves, while others cannot
exist but in something else.  An object existing by itself, as
a lamb, a tree, gold, myself, is called an individual or a substance.
An object existing only in something else, as walking,
singing, good health, color, is called an accident or an attribute.<p>

The words accident and attribute, although sometimes indiscriminately
used, are not, strictly speaking, synonymous.  The
word attribute refers to an essential element of a substance, such
as reason and a certain bodily form in man; accident, to an element
which an individual may lose without ceasing to be what
it is; such as health in man.  The attribute is one of the constituent
elements of a substance; the accident is not.  As this
distinction is not of capital importance for our present study,
we shall not insist upon it any more.<p>

Substance is thus identifiable with individual, and means a
complete object.  It is not an unknowable thing lying beyond
the attributes; it is the attributes themselves.  The essence, as
Hegel says, must appear or shine forth.  It is not proper, however,
to call the substance a heap of attributes, because it is the
substance, and not the attributes, that possesses individuality.
Instead of defining the substance in terms of the attributes, we
must define the attributes in terms of the substance.<p>

Substance is that which exists by itself.  Here we must return
for a moment to an assumption of David Hume, of which we
have already spoken.  We have seen that the author of the
<i>Treatise on Human Nature</i> admits our theory in its essential
principle.  But, as he regards everything as capable of existing
by itself, and hence denies the existence of attributes, the conception
of substance becomes meaningless in his hands, just as
the expression "relative knowledge," becomes meaningless in
the system of absolute relativity, just as the conception of subjective
fact becomes meaningless if we adopt the position of the
subjectivist.<p>

An analysis of the facts of our world convinces us that substance
is not, as Hume maintains, each individual impression or
quality.  Experience shows that these individual impressions do
not, in point of fact, exist apart from each other.  Hume's
capital fallacy consists in arguing that what we may conceive as
existing apart, may and does exist apart.  If color, etc., existed
apart from any other sensible qualities, it would, indeed, be a
substance.  And we do not deny that it might possibly exist in
this manner.  But the question is not whether it could, but
whether it does so exist.  And our constant experience shows
that it does not.  Experience must be our guide as to the nature
of reality.  Hume overlooks this capital truth, and thus sorely
confuses the possible with the actual.  A railroad may be conceived
as existing from here to the moon, but it does not exist.
Hume's reasoning would tend to prove that it does.<p>

Substance and attributes are thus valid conceptions, and bear
to each other the relation of whole and part.<p>

All other definitions of substance must be rejected as incomplete
or erroneous.  We cannot identify substance with a passive
recipient, as Descartes did, because experience proves beyond the
possibility of a doubt that substances, bodily as well as mental,
are endowed with activity.  Sugar acts upon our palate, a chemical
product upon our blood, a peal of thunder upon our tympanum.
No less active is mind.  To its activity is due the
whole progress, the whole civilization of the human race.  Leibniz's
definition of substance as "the being endowed with activity"
is certainly the expression of a great truth.  Passivity,
however, is another element of our universe, indispensable to an
adequate account of reality.  Some of the properties of matter,
such as extension and inertia, can hardly be explained without
taking passivity into account.  The fact of knowledge itself,
although involving an activity on our part, forces us to regard
our mind as a passive recipient, capable of being elected by all
sorts of objects, and necessarily determined by the particular
reality which possesses the character of evident truth.<p>

Finally, with regard to Kant's identification of substance with
the permanent in change, we will simply remark that a permanent
element in the continuous flux of things is, indeed, generally
admitted by scientists nowadays, and that, if we choose to
call it substance, no great harm will ensue.  In doing so, however,
we depart from the usual acceptation of the word substance,
and reduce ourselves to the necessity of inventing new
terms for distinguishing things existing by themselves from
things existing only in something else.<p>

Our definition of substance as the being existing by itself may
be interpreted in different ways.  It may be said that finite
beings cannot be properly defined as existing by themselves,
inasmuch as they have not in themselves the ground of their
existence.  God has created them and continually preserves
them; and this preservation is a continual creation, so that, if
it should cease, all things would be reduced to nothing.  Finite
beings are thus essentially contingent.  They depend upon the
knowledge and power of God, who is the only being really existing
by itself.<p>

This remark was passed by Descartes, who confessed that his
definition of substance properly applied to God alone.  Unwilling,
however, to depart from the ordinary use of language,
he admitted two orders of finite substances:  bodies and spirits,
and supposed that the essence of body consists in extension, the
essence of spirit in thought.  Spinoza took up Descartes's idea,
and was not dismayed by its pantheistic implications.  He defined
substance as "that which is in itself and is conceived
through itself; in other words, that of which a conception can
be formed independently of any other conception,"<A HREF="perrierg.html#III44"><SUP>[44]</sup></a> and showed
that God is the only substance.  The same doctrine has been
revived -- with some important modification@by Hegel and his
school.  All monistic idealists maintain that there is only one
mind.  They contend that, as all things are inter-related, they
are parts of a single whole, which is the Absolute, and in which
everything else has its reality, its meaning, its very being.  A
that, Bradley would say, is not a mere that:  it also involves a
what.  And as any that is related to all the other thats, and
hence to all the other whats, and thus comprises the whole series
of thats and whats within its own what, it clearly follows that
there is only one all-embracing what, which is the Absolute.<p>

This view, which closely resembles the Christian doctrine of
the Deity, may certainly contain much truth.  If there is a creative
mind, whose knowledge is the cause of all things, as St.
Thomas teaches, and of whom we are, as it were, the dreams, it
is strictly true that there is only one individual, one all-embracing
substance.  But, whatever good grounds we may have for
the existence of a supreme mind, we do not know it by intuition,
and it is upon our knowledge of our own world, of the world we
possess here and now, that we build our Philosophical conceptions.
In this world, we find many individuals which, although
related to other beings, are complete by themselves in the sense
that we can think of them as independent of any other individual.
This leads us to the problem of individuality.<p>

For the Monists, then, there is only one individual.  All
things, they claim, are so connected that any single object has
no meaning apart from the rest.  It is true that the same experience
which presents us with individuality, obliges us to
recognize continuity.  We ought not, however, to insist upon
one of the elements of our experience and unduly disregard the
other.  Continuity exists; but, besides the fact that it fails to
prove the existence of a mind in which all things are one, the
doctrine of the identity of all things in the Absolute cannot have
much meaning for our practical life, and appears to us as the
night in which all eows are black.<p>

The recognition of a variety of individuals, or substances,
becomes therefore a necessity.  But the question arises as to
what the individual will be; and, on this point, the greatest
diversity of opinion still prevails.  The most extreme view,
would recognize as individuals nothing but the ultimate subdivisions
of being:  the atoms in the inorganic realm, the cell
among organisms.  Man would thus cease to be an individual
and become a colony.<p>

A closer investigation of the nature of reality might perhaps
reconcile all opposite views.  Scientific investigations seem to
have (established that all material beings are made up of identical
ultimate parts, or electrons.  It is likewise admitted that the
inorganic and organic realms present no fundamental difference,
instead of dividing chemistry into inorganic and organic,
as was done before, we now regard it as essentially one.<p>

The conclusion to be derived from these scientific discoveries
is that the electron is the ultimate individual, not only in the
mineral, but also in the organic realm.<p>

A whole organism, however, is with equal propriety an individual,
because it is a unique and complete being, with its own
life, its proper operations, its peculiar activity.<p>

Finally, the molecule and the atom are also individuals; the
former for the physicist, the latter for the chemist.  The molecule
cannot be divided by physical means.  It possesses a unity
of its own and is the individual about which the science of
physics is concerned.  Chemistry, on the other hand, operates
upon the atoms themselves.  It is by combining them in different
ways that it effects the various chemical transformations,
that it produces the immense variety of compound substances.<p>

We are thus compelled to distinguish different classes of individuals
or substances, which do not exclude one another, but
exist in such a way that the individual of a lower class is at the
same time an element in the constitution of the individuals of
the higher class.  (This principle, we must here observe, does
not unqualifledly apply to God, as will be seen in the sequel.)<p>

We have, accordingly:
1.  The absolute individual, or God.
2.  The organic individual, as man.
3.  The physical individual, or the molecule.
4.  The chemical individual, or the atom.
5.  The ultimate individual, or the electron.<p>

Our list purposely omits finite spirits, as angels, because as
they do not fall within our experience, and a knowledge of them
cannot be reached by reason alone, philosophy is not concerned
with them.<p>
<p>

<b><a name="4">SECTION</a> 4. -- SCHOLASTIC THEORY OF CAUSE</b><p>

According to Scholastic philosophy, cause is the principle
upon which a thing depends in its being or its becoming.
<i>"Causae dicuntur ex quibus res dependit secundum esse vel
fieri."</i><A HREF="perrierg.html#III45"><SUP>[45]</sup></a><p>

Aristotle and the Scholastics distinguish four kinds of causes:
material, formal, efficient and final.<p>

The material and the formal causes are the constitutive
principles of beings.  As we shall deal with them at great length
in our chapter on cosmology, we shall abstain from treating of
them now.  Our present study will therefore be limited to the
efficient and the final causes.<p>

In the opinion of the plain man, an efficient cause is that
which really produces an effect.  When the laborer drinks a
glass of water, and thus quenches his thirst, he believes that the
thirst-quenching not only occurred after, but was produced by
the action of the water.<p>

It has become a fashion in philosophy to deride the notions
of the plain man.  A student nowadays is often smiled at for
his naivet&eacute; if he believes that his book is really in his desk when
nobody perceives it; he is looked upon as ignorant of the invariable
laws of nature if he regards his will as free; he is
ridiculed as a fetich-worshipper if he feels the slightest sympathy
for the old doctrine of causal power.  For my part, I
confess that I can hardly part from these naive beliefs; and, at
the risk of being mocked for not having yet bestridden the
threshold of philosophy, I frankly take part with the plain man
in his realism, his libertarianism, his belief in efficiency.<p>

The Scholastic doctrine of efficient cause has met two classes
of opponents:  some, following Hume, have dropped out the concept
of efficiency altogether and reduced causality to a mere
invariable antecedence; others, with Malebranche, have accepted
the genuine notion of cause, but they have limited it to the
Supreme Being, denying all efficiency to created things.<p>

Malebranche's occasionalism needs not detain us long.  There
is actually little danger of limiting causality to God alone.  Inclined
as we are to question the very existence of a supreme
mind, we feel little sympathy for a system which considers this
mind as the only efficient factor in the world.<p>

We shall therefore limit ourselves to a few considerations
which have been frequently urged against occasionalism.<p>

1.  Malebranche's fundamental principle that activity is
proper to God alone and cannot be communicated to creatures,
is devoid of foundation.  God can do all that is intrinsically
possible; and there is nothing so evidently possible as a creature
endowed with activity.
2.  God's wisdom manifests itself in the infinite variety of
organisms we observe in the universe.  From the molecule of
the mineral to the elaborate body of man, there is a wonderful
series of organized beings possessed of particular potentialities,
endowed with a surprising adaptation of means to ends.  The
paw of the cat, for example, so perfectly adapted to the catching
of the prey, is a marvel for the naturalist.  Now, if finite beings
possess no efficiency; if, when the cat stretches its paw, it is
God that catches the mouse -- as Malebranche would maintain--
the intricate organization of created things becomes a useless
machinery.  The external world itself is altogether unnecessary;
and, should it be annihilated, we would noways notice its disappearance.<p>

3.  Our own consciousness, which has been justly called the
ultimate court of appeal in the science of mind, testifies that,
whenever we act, our own course of action is in dependence upon
our will.  So little are we convinced that God acts in us, that
we feel remorse whenever our action is not done in accordance
with duty, and do not doubt that we can act otherwise in the
future.  It is true that Malebranche adinits the freedom of the
will; but, in so doing, he obeys his theological prejudices rather
than the logic of his system.<p>

Let us now pass to Hume's theory of causation, which is not,
like Malebranche's, an object of interest to the antiquarian alone,
but is still vivid among us; and, despite its shortcomings, does
not seem as yet doomed to a speedy disappearance.<p>

Hume's analysis of the idea of causation is often honored as
his greatest contribution to philosophy. And it cannot be
denied that it is a superb piece of work, that it evinces a remarkable
power of analysis in its author.  If we grant the original
assumptions from which Hume starts, we are irresistibly led,
step by step, to his final conclusion.  But, similar to an architect
who would build a stately edifice upon a slender foundation,
Hume has failed to probe, in a sufficient degree, the ground upon
which he has been at work, so that his elaborately constructed
mansion, in spite of the studied arrangement of its parts, affords
no safe lodging to the traveler, who feels compelled to shun it
as by a natural instinct.<p>

The fundamental principle given by Hume at the outset, and
which he keeps constantly in mind, is that all our ideas are
derived from impressions.<A HREF="perrierg.html#III46"><SUP>[46]</sup></a><p>

He accordingly asks what impression produces the idea of
causation.  It cannot be a quality of the object, "since, whichever
of these qualities I pitch on, I find some object that is not
possessed of it, and yet falls under the denomination of cause
and effect."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III47"><SUP>[47]</sup></a>  It must therefore be a relation among objects;<A HREF="perrierg.html#III49"><SUP>[49]</sup></a>
and Hume is led to examine the different kinds of relation from
which the idea of causation may arise.  He at first discovers
contiguity and succession.<A HREF="perrierg.html#III49"><SUP>[49]</sup></a>  He does not, however, attach much
importance to this discovery; and, after a weak attempt to
establish its truth by reasoning, he tells us that, if his argument
appears satisfactory, it is well; if not, we are begged to suppose
it such.<A HREF="perrierg.html#III50"><SUP>[50]</sup></a><p>

He soon discovers, however, a necessary connection as the
essential element of causation; but he does not at first find any
light as to the real nature of this connection, and resolves "to
beat the neighboring fields, without any certain view or design,
with the hope that his good fortune will at last guide him to
what he searches for."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III51"><SUP>[51]</sup></a><p>

An examination of the proposition that "Whatever has a beginning
has also a cause of existence" convinces him that it
expresses a principle neither intuitively nor demonstrably certain,
and he triumphantly refutes it by the following argument:<p>

"As all distinct ideas are separable from each other, and as
the ideas of cause and effect are evidently distinct, it will be easy
for us to conceive any object to be non-existent this moment,
and existent the next, without conjoining to it the distinct idea
of cause or productive principle.  The separation, therefore, of
the idea of cause from that of a beginning of existence, is plainly
possible for the imagination; and consequently the actual separation
of these objects is so far possible, that it implies no contradiction
nor absurdity."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III52"><SUP>[52]</sup></a><p>

The conclusion is that our belief in the necessity of a cause
must be derived from experience, and Hume proceeds to examine
the particular note of our experience to which the idea of causation
may be due.  When he least expected it, he discovers a
new relation in which he eagerly hails the long-sought-for
answer, and we are told that the necessary connection between
cause and effect is their constant conjunction.<A HREF="perrierg.html#III53"><SUP>[53]</sup></a>  At once, some
interesting conclusions are drawn, viz., that we have no right
to apply causation to future experience, inasmuch as we can
conceive a change in the course of nature, and therefore that
change is possible; also, that causal necessity is something that
exists in the mind, not in objects.<A HREF="perrierg.html#III54"><SUP>[54]</sup></a><p>

Hume does not, however, deny a power in the cause, nor a
real production:<p>

"We may remark," says he, "not only that two objects are
connected by the relation of cause and effect when the one produces
a motion or any action in the other, but also when it has
a power of producing it";<A HREF="perrierg.html#III55"><SUP>[55]</sup></a><p>

and further:<p>

"It will always be impossible to decide with certainty whether
they (the impressions) arise immediately from the object, or
are produced by the creative power of the mind,<A HREF="perrierg.html#III56"><SUP>[56]</sup></a> or are derived
from the author of our being."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III57"><SUP>[57]</sup></a><p>

Some incidental outbursts of honesty even reveal him as
identifying the causal action with real production:<p>

"Should any one pretend to define a cause by saying it is
something productive of another, it is evident he would say
nothing.  For what does he mean by production?  Can he give
any definition of it, that will not be the same with that of
causation?  If he can, I desire it may be produced.  If he
cannot; he here runs in a circle, and gives a synonymous term
instead of a definition."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III58"><SUP>[58]</sup></a><p>

Such passages as this might tempt us to go and shake hands
with Hume at once, in the belief that we have at least come to
an agreement.  It would not be prudent, however, to act too
hastily.  In a subsequent chapter, the supposed power and
efficacy of causes is examined at great length.  Hume's original
assumption that all ideas are copies of previous impressions,
there convinces him that "we have no idea of power or
efficacy";<A HREF="perrierg.html#III59"><SUP>[59]</sup></a> that, when we use those words, we have really no
distinct meaning;<A HREF="perrierg.html#III60"><SUP>[60]</sup></a> finally, that the power which unites causes
and effects resides in our mind."<A HREF="perrierg.html#III61"><SUP>[61]</sup></a><p>

In his reduction of the causal action to a constant conjunction,
Hume was -- if we believe him -- actuated by a most
laudable purpose.  He intended to rid philosophy of those
mysterious entities, of those occult powers, which had so long
crawled in the study of the learned, and had not yet been fully
dispelled by the enlightenment of the new century.<p>

Unfortunately, it often happens that a mystery is replaced
by another mystery greater than the first; that a most unreasonable
demand on our power of faith is made by the very men who
are sometimes so difficult to satisfy in matter of proof.  This is
exactly the case with David Hume.  Motions and changes were
satisfactorily accounted for in the old causal theory, and become
a perfect mystery in his.  Let us suppose that the event A has
been followed by the event B.  As, according to Hume's assumption,
the two events A and B may be conceived as unconnected,
we may neglect the element A, and reduce the series, A, B, to
the series not-B, B. If we maintain the necessity of an efficient
principle, we will explain the production of B by the action of
A; which, as Aristotle would say, contains B potentially.  If we
deny efficient action, we must maintain either that B comes from
nothing, or that it comes from not-B.  But, as, on the one hand,
from nothing nothing can come; and as, on the other hand,
not-B simply denotes beings in which B does not enter as an
element, no shadow of reason is given for the production of B,
and we find ourselves face to face with a reality incomparably
more mysterious than the causal principle which had been discarded
for its mysterious character.<p>

Passing to a closer examination of Hume's theory, we will at
once remark that his first principle: "all ideas are derived from
impressions," not only is not self-evident, but is absolutely
erroneous.  It is true that all knowledge begins with sense-
experience; but it does not follow that all ideas are copies of
sense-impressions.  If such were the case, we would never be
able to step beyond the data of the senses; we would be incapable
of forming universal concepts; even memories of past impressions
would become inexplicable, and we could not attribute any
reality but to the present instant.  Our mental faculties are
originally aroused into exercise by the data of the senses; but
they possess an activity of their own which enables them to
connect what sense-experience presents as unconnected; to reason
about given data; to reach conclusions about nature which are
implied in the natural facts, but are not directly given, and
must be drawn by the active power of our mind.<p>

Hume repeatedly maintains that the idea of cause implies a
necessary connection.<A HREF="perrierg.html#III62"><SUP>[62]</sup></a><p>

Now constant conjunction is unable to give us the idea of
necessity.  For, what does constant conjunction mean?  Simply
that in all singular past instances we observed, two events happened
to be connected.  Each instance was a contingent fact
independent of all others.  As we cannot step beyond the data
furnished by sense-perception, we cannot reach any law of connection
between the individual cases, which remain essentially
singular and unconnected; so that their multitude, however
great it may be, is unable to alter their contingent character.
Hume, it is true, grasped this consequence, and tried to explain
our idea of the necessary character of the cause, not from an
accumulation of individual cases, but from a natural propensity
of our mind to pass from the idea of one object to the idea of
another.<A HREF="perrierg.html#III63"><SUP>[63]</sup></a>  It would be interesting to know whether this propensity
of the mind is derived from sense-impressions or not.
If it is, we hardly see how it can assume a character of necessity.
It cannot certainly get it from the sense-impressions themselves,
because each impression is a contingent fact unconnected with
the rest.  If, on the other hand, this propensity is not derived
from sense-impressions; if it is a natural and innate disposition,
we have an idea not derived from impressions, and Hume's
fundamental principle falls to the ground.<p>

Moreover, the resolution of cause into constant conjunction
presents the capital blemish of disregarding, in the conception
of cause, the causal element itself.  Hume closely resembles a
theatrical manager who would give the play of Hamlet without
the Prince of Denmark.<p>

Constant conjunction and efficiency are by no means identical
concepts.  Constant conjunction means that an event invariably
<i>comes after;</i> efficiency means that the second event not only
<i>comes after,</i> but is <i>due</i> to the first.  There may be efficiency
without constant conjunction, and constant conjunction without
efficiency.<p>

Constant conjunction between two events may take place
without any action of the one upon the other when both events
are due to a single cause.  In nature, night is invariably followed
by day; but is not, on that account, regarded as its cause.
Their constant, conjunction is due to the fact that both night
and day are produced by the successive positions of the sun.<p>

In a mathematical series, such as:<p>

(I X x)[n] = I + nx + Ax<A HREF="perrierg.html#III2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a> + Bx<A HREF="perrierg.html#III2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a> + ...,<p>

a definite term, nx, is invariably followed by another definite
term, Ax<A HREF="perrierg.html#III2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a>.  Their constant conjunction is due to the nature of
the expression (I+ x)[n], and by no means to anything like
efficient action.<p>

Efficiency, on the other hand, may appear without constant
conjunction.  It is true that it cannot thus appear in the realm
of the necessary.  Objects of nature are determined by their
own potentialities to some definite effects; and, whenever they
are placed in suitable conditions, the reaction which occurs gives
rise to these effects.  The like does not hold with regard to free
agents.  Human beings are persuaded of their own efficient
action in singular instances, even when similar cases have never
taken place in the past and are not likely to take place in the
future.  Only once did Lincoln sign the Emancipation
Proclamation.  Nobody doubts the efficiency of his will in this
momentous crisis of our history, although a similar conjuncture
had never occurred before and will never occur again.  Lincoln
might then have acted otherwise; and, should our country be
placed in identical circumstances once more, we clearly conceive
that our president might take a different course of action.  We
would thus have identical antecedents, and different results, and
would not hesitate, however, to attribute the result in both cases,
to the efficient action of the head of the nation.<p>

In physical nature itself, we often attribute efficient action
to objects which have not been invariably conjoined.  In all our
past experience, we may have observed that quinine is an excellent
remedy for fever.  The ninety-nine patients to whom we
administered it were in different circumstances with regard to
age, physical constitution and general health; but all presented
the identical character of being affected with fever; and all, on
taking quinine, were suddenly relieved.  We thus feel no doubt
as to the efficient action of quinine, and a new patient having
got the same disease, we have recourse to our nostrum again.
Unfortunately, as soon as the sick man has swallowed our
favorite remedy, he feels worse and dies.  The result is unexpected.
It is contrary to the previous course of things.
There is certainly no constant conjunction. Still, we cannot
help attributing to quinine the deplorable event.  We feel sure
that quinine has killed our sick man.<p>

Efficiency and constant conjunction go together in the physical
world when one single agent is at work.  But when several
causes are acting in different directions, they may incidentally
meet, and, by their conjunction, give rise to an unexpected
result, which presents no necessary connection with any of the
particular causes, and is simply attributed to chance, although
the causes at work have been efficient factors.  This is exactly
what happens in the case of our sick man.  A chemist could
tell us beforehand the result of his experiments, because he has
to do with materials directly acting upon one another, and
whose action is not thwarted by appreciable contrary forces.
But the chemical products used by the physician do not necessarily
act in accordance with his expectation because the inner
nature of the patient reacts and often produces effects which
had not been anticipated.  Had Hume been interested in medicine,
he might have felt some suspicion as to the value of his
identification of efficiency with constant conjunction.<p>

What he has missed is the reaction itself which takes place as
soon as the two agents are brought together.  He has seen the
antecedent conditions, the subsequent result; he has overlooked
the very instant in which the causal action occurs.<p>

The philosophy of invariable sequence thus falls heavily to the
ground under the weight of its unfounded assumptions and
absurd consequences, without any hope of ever being able to rise
again.  The efficient action of Aristotle and the schoolmen,
proud of its decisive victory, appears on the field anew as the
only theory capable of giving a satisfactory account of experience.
It shows us that in all cases in which a reaction takes
place, a result not only follows some definite antecedents, but
is due to their natural potentialities; that the quenching of fire
follows the application of water precisely because water is
endowed with a capacity for quenching fire; a capacity which
other agents, such as cotton, do not possess, inasmuch as these
agents, being placed in similar conditions, similar results do
not follow.<p>

The much ridiculed answer that opium causes sleep because
it possesses a dormitive virtue, is not only the expression of
common sense, but a highly philosophic truth.  It is the best,
nay the only answer that could possibly be given.  Since
Moli&egrave;re wrote his play, and the Parisian theatre-goers stupidly
laughed at what the talent of the poet was able to present in so
comical a light, the burst of laughter has spread all over the
world.  Everybody has jeered at the foolish reply: but, for
powerful reasons, no one has ever been able to correct it.<p>

The problem of final causes has been sometimes formulated
in the following picturesque form:  The bird has wings, and it
flies.  Does it fly because it has wings, or has it wings to fly?
As Mgr. Mercier remarks,<A HREF="perrierg.html#III64"><SUP>[64]</sup></a> is formulation of the problem
is unfortunate.  It seems to imply that the efficient and the
final causes exclude each other; a principle which all advocates
of finality would undoubtedly reject.<p>

The final cause may be defined as the good for the sake of
which the efficient cause acts, <i>"hoc dicimus esse finem in quod
tendit impetus agentis."</i><A HREF="perrierg.html#III65"><SUP>[65]</sup></a><p>

The final cause may be considered in rational and irrational
beings.  In rational beings, it is a known and accepted end
which determines their present acts.  In irrational beings, it is
a controlling factor, a natural end to which they irresistibly
tend.<p>

All beings act for an end, and it is this end that determines
their activity.  If an agent were not tending to a definite end,
it would be indifferent towards acting in this or that way, and
consequently would never begin to act.<p>

The existence of final causes, thus demonstrable <i>a priori,</i> may
equally be proved from experience.  There is little doubt that
conscious beings act with an end in view.  The young man who
wants to become a skilful physician begins by studying chemistry
and anatomy; afterwards submits to a long and perhaps
wearisome course in a medical school; voluntarily abstains from
numberless enjoyments towards which he feels naturally inclined,
but which would divert his attention from the goal he
wants to reach; spends his days and a good part of his nights
perusing bulky volumes which, in other circumstances, he would
regard as sovereignly tedious.  Why does this young man submit
to such an irksome task?  What enables him to throw off his
natural indolence?  Simply the end he has in view, the good he
purposes to obtain.  This good which, by its attraction, exercises
such a powerful influence upon the activity of the student, is
evidently a cause.<p>

In unconscious beings, there exists a similar determining
principle.  The acorn buried in the ground tends to a definite
end.  If placed in a favorable environment, it will not act at
random, but will insensibly approach the goal it has been assigned
by nature.  Every succeeding day will witness a more
complete actualization of the oak, which at first existed only in
a potential form.  Only when this end is reached shall the
tendency of the acorn cease; only then shall its final purpose
be realized.<p>

These considerations forcibly impose the final cause upon
the attention of the philosopher.  Even among defenders of
modern thought, the old Scholastic problem of finality reappears.
In a remarkable essay published in the Hibbert Journal,
Mr. George Henslow quite recently developed a theory at bottom
identical with the teaching of the schoolmen.  He gave to the
old causa finales the name of "directivity":<p>

"Suppose a kitten and a young hawk are brought up on precisely
the same animal food, both being carnivorous, one develops
into a cat, with fur, having bones and muscles, etc., of
totally different character from those of the adult hawk, with
feathers, etc.  The same molecules of food supplied the materials
for the building up of their bodies:  why are the results
so totally different?  So, too, in all animals and vegetables: why
should certain substances be guided to certain places -- salts of
lime to bones, silica to teeth and claws, phosphate to brain, etc.
The molecules are first driven about mechanically in the blood
by certain forces; various chemical combinations are made under
the action of other forces; but what directs all the forces which
finally impel the new-made molecules to take up certain positions
and no others in the building up of a body?  Directivity
is a useful word to express the fact.  It commits one to nothing
as to its source; but it at least supplies a term to express the
analogy between the chemist's mind and Nature's -- what?"<A HREF="perrierg.html#III66"><SUP>[66]</sup></a><p>

Scientists, it may be observed, leave final causes entirely out
of account, and feel little more sympathy for efficient causes.
It is the scientific development of modern times that has contributed
more than anything else to the apparent discredit of the
causal theory.  It might even be added that the wilful neglect
of causal action has been a most efficient factor in the development
of science.  Why, then, should the metaphysician cling to
a theory whose downfall has been such a blessing to mankind?
Would it not be better to discard efficiency and finality from the
field of philosophy as well as from the field of science?<p>

No doubt this is a real difficulty.  It is the point which
empiricists and positivists love to emphasize, and it gives them
so strong a foothold that, despite the ungrounded assumptions
and irrational consequences of their system, they bravely hold
their own.  It must be remarked, however, that the scientist
and the metaphysician have very different problems to face.
Science is concerned merely with facts and results.  The
cbemist has simply to establish the fact that, if two grams of
hydrogen and sixteen grams of oxygen are brought together and
submitted to the action of the electric spark, water will invariably
follow.  The biologist needs not go beyond the actual
conditions necessary to the duplication and development of the
cell.  For him, a monster is no less natural than a normal
organism.  Science, as Pasteur clearly pointed out, is essentially
positivistic.<p>

But, does the scientific position solve the enigma of the world?
Does it satisfy our thirst for knowledge?  Are there not many
genuine problems which science does not approach?  Why is the
proportion 2 to 16 necessary for the production of water?  Why
do organisms usually reach a normal development, and are
monsters so rare?  These are questions which the metaphysician
alone is able to answer.  He alone is concerned with the ultimate
nature of reality.  He alone professes to make a thinking
study of things.  The scientist formulates the law that an
embryo placed in such and such circumstances will develop into
such an organism.  The metaphysician takes up these scientific
facts, studies their mutual connections and implications, and is
led by the facts themselves to the conclusion that the embryo
does not develop at random, but is constantly controlled and
tends to a definite result.<p>
