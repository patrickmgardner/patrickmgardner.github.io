The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter XI: The Neo-Scholastic Revival in Germany, Austria and 
Switzerland</h1><hr><p>

The philosophical systems of Kant and Hegel exercised a
powerful influence upon Catholic philosophy in Germany.
Georg Hermes (1775-1831) and Anton G&uuml;nther (1783-1863)
defended the omnipotence of human reason, and, following
Hegel, rejected the distinction between natural and supernatural
truths -- one of the fundamental tenets of the Catholic Church.
Rome condemned their doctrines and placed their writings on
the Index, so that their efforts, from a Catholic point of view,
were a failure.<p>

A movement of return towards Thomistic philosophy then
took place among German Catholic thinkers; so that, when Leo
XIII published his encyclical, Catholic Germany eagerly espoused
the views of the Pontiff.<p>

Among the men who prepared this return to Scholasticism
must be mentioned:<p>

Friedrich Schlegel, who, in his <i>History of Ancient and Modern
Literature,</i> showed the real merit of Mediaeval philosophy.<p>

M&ouml;hler and his disciple Staudenmaier, who condemned all
forms of rationalism.<p>

Clemens, whose aim was the refutation of G&uuml;nther.<p>

Rothenflue, who, in spite of some ontologistic and Rosminian
ideas, agreed in the main with the philosophy of the School.<p>

But the two philosophers who most actively contributed to the
revival of Scholasticism in Germany were Kleutgen and St&ouml;ckl.<p>

Joseph Kleutgen, S.J. (1811-1883), published in 1860 his
<i>Philosophie der Vorzeit,</i> which has become one of the classical
works of neo-Scholastic literature.  The <i>Philosophie der Vorzeit</i>
is not, like Sanseverino's <i>Philosophia Christiana</i> or Urraburu's
<i>Institutiones,</i> a detailed course of Scholastic philosophy.  It is
rather a work of defense.  Kleutgen is not the peaceful statesman
who organizes his country; he is the general on the battlefield.
His chief purpose is to purge German Catholic philosophy
of all traces of Hegelianism.  He vigorously attacks
Hermes and G&uuml;nther.   He defends the Scholastic conceptions
against the erroneous interpretations of Frohschammer, Malebranche
and others.<p>

He also expounds the fundamental principles of Thomism,
and shows that they are the only principles capable of giving
entire satisfaction to human reason.<p>

Among Kleutgen's contributions to the body of Scholastic
doctrines, let us mention his famous principles of knowledge,
which have been generally accepted by subsequent neo-Thomists:<p>

1.  Knowledge results of the fact that an image of the known
object is produced in the knower by the concourse of the known
object and of the knower.<p>

2.  The known object is in the knower according to the mode
of the knower.<p>

3.  Knowledge becomes more perfect in proportion as the
knower is more remote, by the nature of his being, from material
conditions.<A HREF="perrierg.html#XI1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a><p>

Not long after the publication of the <i>Philosophie der Vorzeit,</i>
Albert St&ouml;ckl (1823-1895) wrote his two most important works:
<i>Geschichte der Philosophie des Mittelatters</i> (1864-66), and
<i>Lehrbuch der Philosophie.</i>  The latter is a clear and valuable
exposition of the Thomistic philosophy; the former, one of the
works which initiated those historical investigations about
Scholasticism, of which the nineteenth century is so legitimately
proud.<p>

The most important contribution of Germany to Scholastic
philosophy since the days of Kleutgen and St&ouml;ckl is the series
published under the name of <i>Philosophia Lacensis</i> by the Jesuits
of Maria-Laach.  This series comprises the following works:<p>

<i>Institutiones logicales</i> (3 vol.); <i>Institutiones philosophiae
naturae</i>; and <i>Institutiones psychologicae,</i> by Tilmann Pesch;
<i>Institutiones theodicoeae sive theologiae naturalis,</i> by J. Hontheim;
<i>Institutiones juris naturalis,</i> by Th. Meyer; eleven volumes in
all, forming a complete course of Scholastic philosophy.<p>

The <i>Philosophia Lacensis</i> is more decidedly Scholastic in its
method than any other work neo-Thomism has produced.  Fr.
Pesch follows in his exposition the same plan St. Thomas followed.
Like St. Thomas, he begins with an exposition of adverse
doctrines, passes to the thesis containing his own views,
ends with an answer to the objections given in the first part.<p>

Such a method must not, however, lead us to believe that the
eminent authors of the <i>Philosophia Lacensis</i> are servile
followers of the Middle Ages and ignore modern ideas.  Their
acquaintances with the current of modern philosophy is remarkable.
Fr. Pesch discusses all recent scientific hypotheses in his
<i>Institutiones Philosophiae Naturalis,</i> and tries to establish upon these
hypotheses the foundation of Thomistic cosmology.  A like
knowledge of modern psychology appears in the <i>lnstitutiones
Psychologicae.</i><p>

Fathers Meyer and Hontheim follow the same method and
display the same erudition.  The latter has recently applied
mathematics to logic in his work:  <i>Der logische Algoritmus</i>
(1895).<p>

Besides Meyer, neo-Scholastic Germany possesses two moralists
of a great merit, Costa-Rosetti (1841-1900) and Cathrein.<p>

Victor Cathrein, S.J. (died 1899), published his
<i>Moralphilosophie</i> in 1890, and gave it a new in a more concise form a few
years afterwards, as one of the volumes of the series <i>Cursus
philosophicus,</i> of which more in the sequel.  One of the most
important studies contained in Cathrein's work is the chapter
dealing with Socialism.  Published separately in German, and
honored by five editions in less than two years, it has been translated
into English, French, Italian, Polish and Flemish.  Although
the author's conclusions are opposed to the socialistic
theories, Socialists themselves have been compelled to admit that
he had grasped the essential principles of their system more
adequately than some of their own followers.<p>

One of the greatest German neo-Scholastics of the present
time is Mr. Constantin Gutherlet, professor in Fulda Seminary.
As may be seenin our Bibliography, Mr. Gutherlet has studied
the thought ofthe Angelic Doctor under all its aspects.  Besides
numerous shorter treatises, he published, between the
years 1878 and 1884, the volumes of his <i>Lehrbuch der
Philosophie.</i>  This important work, in which the author generally
follows Suarez, has been the first great successful attempt to
harmonize modern science with Thomistic principles.  Gutherlet's
greatest service to the cause he defends has perhaps been the
foundation of the review <i>Philosophisches Jahrbuch,</i> which, since
1888, has been read with avidity by all who are interested in the
Scholastic revival.  According to Mr. Picavet, the <i>Philosophisches
Jahrbuch</i> is the most eclectic and the best informed of all
neo-Scholastic periodical publications.<p>

German neo-Scholastic literature possesses another review of
great value, the <i>Jahrbuch f&uuml;r Philosophie und speculative
Theologie.</i>  This review was founded in Paderborn in 1887 by
Ernst Commer, professor in the University of Vienna.  As its
title indicates, it does not confine itself to philosophical questions.
It often contains interesting theological discussions, and
especially comparative studies of Catholic and Protestant
theology.<p>

Besides the Jahrbuch, Mr. Commer has published some important
works, viz., <i>System der Philosophie, Logik, Die immerwahrende
Philosophie,</i> etc., which have given him the first rank
among neo-Scholasties in Austria.<p>

A third review, the <i>Saint-Thomasbl&auml;tter,</i> published for some
years in Regensburg by Mr. C. M. Schneider, was more strictly
Thomistic than the two other publications we have mentioned.
Thomism, according to Mr. Schneider, must be accepted in its
entirety or not be accepted at all.  This principle inspired the
<i>Saint-Thomasbl&auml;tter,</i> and recurs in all the works Mr. Schneider
has published.<p>

Germany has distinguished itself, more than any other nation,
by important works concerning the history of philosophy in the
Middle Ages.  We have already spoken of Albert St&ouml;ckl.  Not
long afterwards, Carl Werner published important monographs
dealing with the doctrine of all the great Mediaeval thinkers.
Alcuin, Albert the Great, William of Auvergne, Roger Bacon,
St. Bonaventure, St. Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Suarez,
were studied with untiring zeal and incredible erudition.<p>

Some years later, Ehrle and Henry Denifle, O.P. (died 1905),
published the <i>Archiv f&uuml;r Literatur und Kirchengeschichte des
Mittelalters,</i> which made known many an unknown text, and
enriched neo-Scholastic literature with numerous learned studies.
Denifle also wrote a <i>History of the Universities in the Middle
Ages,</i> which is the most precious work we possess on the subject.
This History gave its author such a fame that the French Academy
invited him to write a <i>Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis,</i>
which he completed (1891) with the cooperation of A.
Chatelain.<p>

More directly concerned with philosophy than Denifle's contributions
are the important works of Clemens Baeumker and
Baron G. V. von Hertling, published, since 1891, under the
title of <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Geschichte der Philosophie des
Mittelalters.</i>
The collection consists of works heretofore unpublished, critical
editions of works already known, monographs, etc.  Among the
works it already contains let us mention:  the <i>De Unitate</i> of
Dominicus Gonzalez, falsely attributed to Boethius, the <i>Fons
Vitae</i> of the Jewish philosopher Ibn Gebirol, the Theory of
Knowledge of William of Auvergne, the <i>Impossibilia</i> of Siger
de Brabant, Mr. Grabman's learned study on Cardinal Matthew
of Aquasparta, etc.<A HREF="perrierg.html#XI2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a><p>

Besides this most important contribution to neo-Scholastic
literature, Mr. Baeumker has published:  <i>Das Problem der
Materie in der griechischen Philosophie</i> (1890).<p>

In German Switzerland, the most important center of neo-
Thomism is the Catholic University of Friburg, in which the
classes of philosophy and theology have been confided to the
Dominican Fathers.  Among the eminent men who have taught
in the university may be mentioned Coconnier, Berthier and
Mandonnet.<p>

The most distinguished neo-Scholastic in Switzerland is not,
however, connected with Friburg University.  It is the Rev.
Nicolas Kaufmann, president of the Academy of St. Thomas
of Lucern.  Mr. Kaufmann has contributed numerous articles
to the <i>Revue Neo-Scolastique,</i> the <i>Philosophisches
Jahrbuch,</i> and
several Swiss periodicals, and has published many valuable
works dealing with particular aspects of the philosophy of
Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas (cf. Bibliography).  One of the
best known is his study on Final Cause, which has been translated
into French.  In articles published in the <i>Schweizerische
Kirchenzeitung,</i> especially in the article entitled:  <i>Dos
Pontificat Leos XIII und der Neutkomismus,</i> Kaufmann has shown that
his view of the neo-Thomistic movement is identical with the
view of Leo XIII, and may be expressed by the famous formula:
<i>vetera novis augere.</i><p>

A complete history of neo-Scholasticism in German-speaking
countries would be very extensive.  Our rapid survey, incomplete
though it be, must not omit the names of the following
distinguished men:<p>

Mathias Schneid (1840-1895) who, besides a work on the
influence of Aristotle upon the Scholastics, <i>Aristoteles in der
Scholastik,</i> published in 1875, and inspired by Talamo's work
on the same subject, has written valuable studies on the cosmological
theories of Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus.<p>

Ludwig Sch&uuml;tz (1838-1901), whose most important contribution
to neo-Scholastic literature is a vocabulary known as
<i>Thomas-Lexicon,</i> in which all scientific terms contained in the
<i>Summa Theologica</i> and the <i>Summa contra Gentiles</i> are
thorougly explained.<p>

Francis Xavier Pfeifer (1829-1902), who has tried to harmonize
the Thomistic philosophy with the recent scientific
hypotheses in his work <i>Harmonische Beziehung zwischen Scholastik
und moderner Naturwissenschaft.</i><p>

Otto Willmann, professor in the University of Prague, and
author of a remarkable <i>History of Idealism.</i><p>

Joseph Jungmann, S.J., the author of one of the best works
dealing with esthetics (<i>AEsthetik,</i> Freiburg, 1884), in which he
finds in Scholastic psychology the foundation of the notion of
the beautiful.<p>

Francis Schaub, the author of a comparative study of the
Thomistic and socialistic theories.<p>

Eugene Rolfes, who has compared the theistic conceptions of
St. Thomas and Aristotle, and has tried to discover in the Greek
philosopher some traces of the Christian dogmas.<p>

Gundisalv. Feldner, who has published a study about St.
Thomas's teaching concerning free will.<p>

Michael Glossner, canon of Munich, one of the best known
contributors to the <i>Jahrbuch f&uuml;r Philosophie und speculative
Theologie.</i><p>

Martin Grabmann, who, besides the learned study on Matthew
of Aquasparta we have already mentioned, has published an
excellent treatise on the idea of God in St. Thomas's philosophy.<p>
