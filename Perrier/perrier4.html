The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter IV: Scholastic Cosmology</h1><hr><p>

<b><a name="1">SECTION</a> 1. -- CHIEF HYPOTHESES AS TO THE CONSTITUTION OF MATTER</b><p>

The question of the constitution of matter is one of those
fundamental problems which, in the course, of human investigation,
have been most widely discussed, and of which an adequate
solution will perhaps never be attained.  It is one of those questions
before which, according to Herbert Spencer, human reason
must humbly confess its powerlessness; a question which seems
to prove a mystery for the human mind and to point to the
existence of the unknowable in nature.<p>

All attempts at a solution of this great problem may be classified
under two heads:  they are all, in some way, connected with
the two theories of Atomism and Dynamism.<p>

The atomistic theory sprung originally from ancient Greece.
According to Aristotle and Theophrastus, it is to Leucippus that
we must attribute the honor of its discovery.  But, as we know
so little of Leucippus, and as his very existence has even been
called into doubt,<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a> we generally consider Democritus, his illustrious
disciple, as the founder of the system.<p>

The loss of all the writings of Democritus is indeed one of
the most deplorable facts in the history of human investigation.
With what burning interest would we not follow the efforts of
his genius to get rid of the untenable hypotheses of his contemporaries
and to reach a satisfactory exposition of the intrinsic
nature of things!  And still, deplorable though it be, such a
loss is unhappily a fact; and our only substitute for a study of
the philosophy of Democritus is to turn to its poetical exposition,
tion, as given by Lucretius in his justly admired poem <i>De
Rerum Natura</i>.<p>

The atomistic theory has undergone, in the course of time,
many profound modifications.  Hard atoms and absolute void
were the only elements which Democritus supposed to exist in
nature.  In recent times, there has arisen the idea of a universal
medium, of a fluid everywhere present, penetrating all bodies,
and serving as a connecting-link between the atoms.<p>

The existence of the ether is indeed only a hypothesis, but it
is a hypothesis that has been rendered very probable by scientific
discoveries; and now, it may almost be considered as an established
fact.  At present we will not discuss the probabilities in
favor of each of the particular ether theories that have been
brought forward.  This theme will be fully treated in one of
the ensuing sections of this chapter.  Suffice it to say that,
although all physicists do not agree as to the inherent constitution
of ether, they all unanimously affirm its existence.<p>

Atomism admits only matter and passive emotion in nature.
Still, a majority of thinkers did not deem these two elements
sufficient to account for the activity which our everyday experience
shows us to exist in the universe, and therefore they thought
it indispensable to introduce into nature the element of force.
And thus the theory of Dynamism originated.<p>

We shall refrain from presenting the various theories held by
the ancient Greeks, which might be termed dynamic.  We shall
not even touch upon Leibniz's famous doctrine of monads, but
we shall consider as the true representative of Dynamism the
Jesuit Boscovich.  Instead of the hypothesis of hard atoms
Boscovich proposed to consider nature as formed of unextended
points, of indivisible centers of force, which mutually attract and
repel each other, are therefore capable of furnishing a satisfactory
explanation of the activity manifested in nature, and give
us the illusion of continuous extension, in the same way as
points placed very near each other might lead us to believe in
their forming continuous letters.<p>

Scholastic cosmology might be described as an intermediate
position between the two systems just outlined.  Its defenders
reproach atomists for denying activity to nature, and contend
that an explanation of all the phenomena of the world by mere
matter and passive motion is forever doomed to remain a fruitless
attempt.  On the other hand, they consider the dynamic
view to be similarly inadequate.  They assert that, although
passivity cannot be the only element in nature, its very existence
must not be denied, and they put forward the theory of Matter
and Form as the only possible explanation of the universe.<p>

I must here confess that I have never felt for the theory of
Matter and Form that unreserved sympathetic feeling wherewith
I have subscribed to so many Scholastic doctrines.  I cannot
help regarding the Thomistic cosmology as arbitrary, assailable
in many points, inconsistent with our advanced scientific
discoveries.  The fact that physics and chemistry unanimously
adhere to some form of atomism is of great significance.  Scholastics
are perfectly justified in insisting on the shortcomings
of Atomism and Dynamism.  They are right when they assert
that activity, as well as passivity, must be admitted in the
composition of our world.  Unhappily, the theory they propose does
not rest upon cogent reasons, and therefore it should be frankly
rejected, or made to undergo important modifications.<p>

The most cursory observation, Scholastics would say, suffices
to show in all matter the element of quantity.  A solid may
become a liquid and a liquid a gas.  A body may be made to
assume an infinite number of forms:  its volume may be increased
or decreased; it may, by chemical combination, acquire
a nature utterly different from the one it formerly possessed;
but in all these transformations, in all these fundamental
changes, there remains the element of quantity, unchanged and
unchangeable, always identical with itself, and which thus seems
to be a common element in all material things.<p>

On the other hand, we cannot help observing the greatest
diversity in nature.  We find in every object an immense number
of peculiar, specific properties.  We have before our eyes
the great division of bodies into inorganic and organic.  In the
inorganic realm, we have solids, liquids and gases, metalloids
and metals, the simple elements which chemistry has found to
exist, and whose number is daily increased by scientific research.
We have the innumerable combinations of those elements, and
the appearance in compound bodies of properties essentially different
from those of their simple constituents.<p>

And if we turn our eyes to the sphere of life, if we consider
the infinite chain of living beings, from the amoeba swimming
in our blood to the more highly-developed body of man -- subjects
of inexhaustible research to the scientific mind -- are we
not struck with wonder and amazement?<p>

When we consider with a philosophic mind these properties
of matter, we see that its qualitative variety and its quantitative
identity are diametrically opposite.  It is this opposition that
led the Scholastics to affirm that such properties must be the
result of different principles.<p>

Another argument in favor of the existence of Matter and
Form, at least as strongly insisted upon as the one we have just
explained, is derived from the supposed essential transformations
tions that take place in chemical combinations:  "Dans ce fait
bien compris et sagement interpr&eacute;t&eacute;, says Mr. Nys, est contenue
comme en germe toute la th&eacute;orie de l'Ecole sur la nature des
corps."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a><p>

In a chemical combination, Scholastics are prone to say, something
remains and something is changed.  That something is
changed -- or, in other words, that a new substance is produced--
is proved beyond any doubt by the fact that the physical properties
of the compound differ essentially from those of their constituent
elements.  It is no less true that something remains,
for otherwise we would not have a change, but a real creation.
The new element is a substantial part of the compound, because
it distinguishes it from its simple constituents.  The stable element
is also a substantial part of the compound.  It is the
determinable principle which, actuated by the new element, has
given rise to a new substance.  The new element is the substantial
form; the stable element, primordial matter.<p>

Francisco Ginebra, following Thomas Aquinas, gives of Matter
and Form the following definitions:<p>

"Form is the incomplete substance which determines matter
and constitutes it in a determinate species.  Matter is the incomplete
material substance which, actuated by the substantial
form, produces a complete corporeal substance."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a><p>

Matter is then, in the Scholastic system, the passive element
of objects.  It is the same in all material things, which acquire
their diversity by means of the substantial form.  But primordial
matter cannot exist in a state of isolation; it is necessarily
united to the substantial form, and the infinite variety of these
forms is the cause of all the diversity we behold in nature.<p>
<p>

<b><a name="2">SECTION</a> 2. -- NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF PRIMORDIAL MATTER</b><p>

To have a fair idea of what Primordial Matter is -- or, to
speak more definitely, of what is meant by that term -- is indeed
a most arduous task, one whose difficulty is enhanced still further
by the unsubstantial and indefinite character of the conception
itself.<p>

This difficulty is recognized by all Scholastic philosophers and
frankly admitted by one of the most ardent sympathizers of
peripatetic philosophy, Barth&eacute;lemy Saint-Hilaire:<p>

"As to these abstractions," says he in the Preface to his Physics,
"the most difficult point is to understand them; but, once
understood, they appear neither false nor useless.  Therefore,
instead of rejecting this formula, one must endeavor to know
what it signifies."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a><p>

Albert Farges, in his most valuable work on the subject,
deems it helpful to give us at first a negative definition:  "To
say what Primordial Matter is not, says he, is a very easy
thing."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV5"><SUP>[5]</sup></a>  He then proceeds to show that it is neither a substance
nor an accident; and that, for this reason, it cannot fall
within the group of Aristotle's categories:<p>

"Can primordial matter be classed as one of the categories?
It is clear that it cannot; as it is neither an attribute nor a
complete substance, and categories do not comprise but these
two sorts of realities."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV6"><SUP>[6]</sup></a><p>

This passage is of the utmost importance, for Aristotle himself
understood by categories the supreme genera to which the
ideas of all things could be reduced, and the same view is still
held by Scholastic philosophers.  We are thus led to the view
that primordial matter is not a reality.<p>

The doubtful character of the existence of primordial matter
was felt even in the Middle Ages.  From the very works of the
founders of Scholastic philosophy, many extracts might be
adduced, to show how slender was the foundation whereon Scholastic
cosmology was reared.  St. Thomas Aquinas, in his opuscule
entitled <i>De principiis naturae,</i> makes the following significant
assertion:<p>

"Materia dicitur quod habet esse ex eo quod sibi advenit, quia
de se esse incompletum, immo nullum esse habet."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV7"><SUP>[7]</sup></a><p>

It is here clearly stated that primordial matter not only has
an incomplete being, but has no being at all.<p>

In the <i>Summa contra Gentiles,</i> the Angelic Doctor speaks
again in almost the same way:<p>

"Ipsum esso," says he, "non est proprius actus materiae, sed
substantiae totius; ejus enim actus est esse, de quo possumus
dicere quod sit.  Esse autem non dicitur de materia sed de
toto."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV8"><SUP>[8]</sup></a><p>

Other similar statements are quoted and discussed by Duns
Scotus.  In his treatise <i>De Rerum Principio</i> (Quaestio VII), he
warns us against the teaching of a few authors who seem to
regard primordial matter as a mere potentiality without an
actual existence.  Among the philosophers he thus mentions,
we find the names of Plato, Aristotle, and St. Augustine.  But
these writers do not, according to Scotus, really teach that
primordial matter does not exist.  They simply have in mind
the fact that, of all existing things, it has the smallest degree
of actuality.<p>

Scotus then passes to a direct proof of the existence of primordial
matter, and brings two classes of arguments: the first
from authority, the second from the light of reason.<p>

The proofs taken by him from reason are four in number and
read thus:<p>

1.  "Si materia non esset aliqua res actu, ejus entitas non
distingueretur ab entitate et actualitate formae, et sic nullam
realem compositionem faceret cum ea."
2.  "Inter ens actu et nihil, non est medium; ergo si materia
praeter formam non habet aliquem actum essendi, erit nihil;
ergo agens creatum ageret de nihilo, cum agat de materia."
3.  "Secundum Philosophos, materia est in potentia ad alia;
sed secundum eos, nihil ad nihil est in potentia: ergo materia,
ut materia, non est nihil; ergo habet aliquem actum de se, et si
non subsistentiae, tamen existentiae."
4.  "Item, posse pati ad materiam reducitur, sicut agere ad
formam; sed quod non est aliquid actu, non est principium
patiendi, nec fundamentum; ergo necessario materia habet
actualitatem aliam ab actualitate formae in qua actualitate
formae fundantur, et stabiliuntur."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV9"><SUP>[9]</sup></a><p>

These four proofs are simply intended to demonstrate that, if
we admit the theory of matter and form, we must regard primordial
matter as something actual.  There is, however, another
alternative:  the rejection of the theory of matter and form.
This alternative, unhappily, Duns Scotus does not consider.<p>

At the risk of intruding too much upon the patience of our
readers, we will reproduce the words of a devoted seeker after
truth, of a man who strove during his whole life to reach a
satisfactory knowledge of nature, to understand in a clear and
definite way what, in the thought of his time, was still obscure
and indefinite.  St. Augustine, in that sublime work which is
not only a humble confession of his life and a profound study
of the human heart, but likewise a treatise in which the philosophy
of his time is exposed and skillfully analyzed, considers
thus the question of matter and form:<p>

"But I, Lord, if I would, by my tongue and my pen, confess
unto thee the whole, whatever Thyself hath taught me of that
matter -- the name whereof hearing before, and not understanding,
when they who understood it, not, told me of it, so I conceived
of it as having innumerable forms and diverse, and therefore
did not conceive it at all, my mind tossed up and down foul
and horrible 'forms' out of all order, but yet 'forms'; and I
called it without form, not that it wanted all form, but because
it had such as my mind would, if presented to it, turn from, as
unwonted and jarring, and human frailness would be troubled at.
And still that which I conceived was without form, not as being
deprived of all form, but in comparison of more beautiful
forms; and true reason did persuade me, that I must utterly
unease it of all remnants of form whatsoever, if I would conceive
matter absolutely without form; and I could not; for
sooner could I imagine that not to be at all, which should
be deprived of all form, than conceive a thing betwixt form
and nothing, neither formed, nor nothing, a formless almost
nothing."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV10"><SUP>[10]</sup></a><p>

We conjecture that the state of mind which St. Augustine
here describes as having been his own has also been experienced
by many a student who has tried to represent to himself clearly
and distinctly what primordial matter is.  It appears, in one
form or other, in the writings of all the masters of Scholasticism,
who, although they unanimously maintain that primordial
matter actually exists, cannot fail to recognize that its actuality
is indeed very weak, and even to drop here and there a word
tending to show that it has really no actuality at all.<p>

Let us now pass to a positive exposition of the nature and
properties of primordial matter.<p>

In the foregoing section of this chapter we have given the
following definition, which would be accepted by all Scholastics:
Matter is the incomplete material substance which, actuated by
the substantial form, produces a complete corporeal substance.<p>

All substances, according to this view, are composed of two
real, distinct, unisolable principles:  matter and form.  Matter
is the same in all bodies, and it is form, and form alone, that
is the cause of the infinite variety of material things:  "Omnium
generabilium et corruptibilium est eadem materia."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV11"><SUP>[11]</sup></a>  Matter
and form, on account of their unisolable character, are incomplete
substances, and it is from their mutual union that complete
corporeal substances arise.<p>

Changes in things are classified as accidental or essential.  In
accidental changes, such as occur in physical processes, the form
remains identical with itself.  But in essential changes, such
as chemical combinations, matter alone remains.  The substantial
form which existed before the combination ceases to exist,
and there arises a new form as the cause of the new substance
of which experience eviden@ the appearance.<p>

The fact of chemical combination plays an important part in
Scholastic cosmology; and, although a few Mediaeval philosophers,
such as Albert the Great, taught that the elements remained
in the compound, and one of the greatest among the
neo-Scholastics, Liberatore, holds that the theory of essential
changes in chemical processes is not necessarily connected with
the Scholastic system, it is nevertheless incontrovertible that the
great majority of Scholastics admit in chemical combinations an
essential transformation, and we have seen how Mr. Nys bases
on this very transformation his strongest argument for the
existence of matter and form.<p>

According to this view, oxygen and hydrogen do not really
exist in water, as there takes place, in the act of combination, a
real change of nature.  The only means of knowing the truth
in this matter is experience; but the most powerful microscopes
show us, in the particles of a compound, the most perfect homogeneity,
and the dissolvents of its simple elements have upon it
no effect whatsoever.  The atomistic view that an atom of water
is a mere juxtaposition of two atoms of hydrogen and one of
oxygen is consequently pronounced to be arbitrary and unscientific,
and unable to account for the essential difference which
exists between a simple mixture and a combination.<p>

And here Farges brings forth the example of gunpowder, in
which the three elements of saltpeter, sulphur and carbon are
so intimately intermingled that no microscope enables us to discern
their presence.  Still, the heterogeneity of the compound
and its character of mixture can be shown by means of dissolvents.
Water dissolves saltpeter and has no effect whatever
upon sulphur and carbon; then another chemical product may
eliminate sulphur, leaving carbon in a state of isolation.<p>

On the other hand, no dissolvent of the elements of a chemical
combination has any effect upon the compound.  Its homogeneous
character remains unaltered, and the only means of separating
its elements is another chemical operation.<p>

Mr. Farges endows primordial matter with the following
properties:  indestructibility, simplicity of essence, identity in
all material substances, passivity, quantitativeness, impenetrability,
need of a substantial form.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV12"><SUP>[12]</sup></a><p>

Primordial matter is indestructible, and cannot cease to exist
unless it be annihilated by an act of Divine Omnipotence.<p>

It is simple as regards its essence, but essentially multiple in
its parts.  It is the cause of the extension and divisibility of
bodies; it is the principle of quantity.<p>

It is identical in all material substances, which, as we have
seen, are distinguished from one another by means of the substantial
form.  Primordial matter is therefore the principle of
all that which is common to all material substances, namely
extension, divisibility, impenetrability, quantity, etc.<p>

In all objects, it constitutes the passive principle, the principle
of inertia, whereas the substantial form is the principle
of activity.<p>

Finally, primordial matter, not being able to exist in a state
of isolation, stands, by the same fact, in need of a substantial
form.  Still, matter does not join itself indistinctly to any kind
of form, but has a special aptitude to choose the form which
suits it best.  And we are thus led to the theory of the hierarchy
of forms, corresponding to the various degrees of perfection and
development in primordial matter.<p>

"The more elevated in the hierarchy of beings the form is,"
says Farges, "the more must matter be prepared by a series of
intermediate forms, which gradually dispose and elevate it.
And this is true in the order of physico-chemical phenomena as
well as in the biological order.  And in no case could disproportionate
elements be united, as, for example, a human soul
with the organism of an ape."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV13"><SUP>[13]</sup></a><p>

Thus far we have spoken of primordial matter in a general
way, without taking into account the various divisions given by
Scholastic philosophers, both in the Middle Ages and in our own
day.  We do not think these divisions indispensable to a thorough
comprehension of the theory, and neo-Scholastics are
unanimous in considering many of them as useless subtleties.
We cannot, however, abstain from enumerating the most important
among them, and we feel confident that such an enumeration
will give a more comprehensive view of Scholastic thought,
and easily make us understand the drift of that teaching.<p>

The first division which suggests itself is that of primordial
and secondary matter.<p>

Secondary matter is the complete material substance modifiable
by accidents, as, for example, any chemical substance.
Primordial matter is the incomplete material substance which,
actuated by the substantial form, produces a complete corporeal
substance.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV14"><SUP>[14]</sup></a><p>

We can easily see by these definitions that primordial matter
alone is matter strictly speaking.  The so-called secondary matter
is any material object as it exists in nature, after having
been actuated by the substantial form:  it is matter as understood
by the plain man, but it must be carefully distinguished
from the materia prima of the schoolmen.<p>

Another well-known division of matter is the <i>out of which,</i>
<i>the in which,</i> and the <i>about which.</i><p>

Primordial matter is <i>out of which</i> relatively to the complete
substance, or to the substantial form which is educed from it.
The body of a brute, for example, is the matter out of which its
soul is evolved.<p>

Primordial matter is <i>in which</i> with regard to the substantial
form considered as united with it, and forming with it a complete
substance.  In this sense, the body of a brute is the matter
in which its soul exists in a state of indissoluble union.<p>

Finally, primordial matter is <i>about which</i> with regard to the
efficient cause by whose action it is produced.  The body of a
brute is thus the matter about which generation is concerned.<p>

Matter out of which has also been subdivided into passing
and persistent matter.  Thus, the matter of the wood submitted
to the action of the fire is passing; while the matter of the wood
used by the carpenter to manufacture a piece of furniture is
persistent.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV15"><SUP>[15]</sup></a>  Not only is this subdivision of little account, but
it seems to be based upon a wrong interpretation of the terms,
inasmuch as primordial matter is persistent in both cases, and
that which is really passing is the substantial form.<p>

But the divisions of matter which show Mediaeval subtlety at
its best are to be found in Duns Scotus.<p>

A singular view on this subject had already appeared in the
eleventh century.  The celebrated Jewish philosopher, Ibn
Gabirol, had advanced in his principal work, <i>Fons Vitae</i>, a
startling theory of universal matter, according to which all
substances, spiritual as well as material, were to be regarded as
composed of matter and form.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV16"><SUP>[16]</sup></a>  This strange doctrine was
later on adopted by some Christian writers and became one of
the leading characteristics of the Franciscan school.<p>

Almost two centuries after the death of lbn Gabirol, the first
Franciscan teacher of theology in the University of Paris,
Alexander of Hales, expressedly taught in his <i>Summa Theologiae</i>
that spiritual substances are composed of matter "quae nec est
subjecta motui nee contrarietati."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV17"><SUP>[17]</sup></a>  The same view was maintained
by St. Bonaventure,<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV18"><SUP>[18]</sup></a> and also by Duns Scotus:<p>

" Ego autem ad positionem Avicembroni redeo; et primam
partem, scilicet quod in omnibus creatis per se subsistentibus
tam corporalibus quam spiritualibus sit una material teneo, sicut
ostensi in praecedenti quaestione."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV19"><SUP>[19]</sup></a><p>

With that distinguishing subtlety which forms the essential
characteristic of his philosophy, Duns Scotus introduces a new
division of the materia prima.  He divides it into <i>materia
primo-prima, materia secundo-prima,</i> and <i>materia tertio-
prima.</i>
The <i>materia primo-prima,</i> or <i>materia metaphysica,</i> seems to
be identical with the universal matter of Ibn Gabirol and of the
Franciscan teachers.  It is absolutely indeterminate and exists
in all beings, incorporeal as well as corporeal.<p>

The <i>materia secundo-prima,</i> or <i>materia mathematica,</i> is
defined as the subject of generation and corruption:<p>

"Est subjectum generationis et corruptionis, quam mutant
agentia creata, seu Angeli seu agentia corruptibilia."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV20"><SUP>[20]</sup></a><p>

The <i>materia tertio-prima</i> is defined as the matter of any
particular natural agent:<p>

"Dicitur autem miteria tertio-prima materia cujuscumque
artis, et materia cujuslibet agentis naturalis particularis, quia
omne tale agit veluti de aliquo semine, quod quamvis materia
prima sit respectu omnium, quae per artem producuntur, supponit
tamen materiam, quae est subjectum generationis, et ulterius
aliquam formam per naturam productam, aliter nulla ars
quid quam operatur."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV21"><SUP>[21]</sup></a><p>

To sum up in a few words:<p>

The <i>materia primo-prima</i>, or metaphysical matter, constitutes
the passive principle of all finite beings, spiritual as well as
material.<p>

The <i>materia secundo-prima</i> is the passive principle of corporeal
substances only, and is called mathematical because it
is the base of extension and quantity.<p>

The <i>materia tertio-prima</i> is the matter of the plain man, and
does not differ from what we have elsewhere termed secondary
matter.<p>

<b><a name="3">SECTION</a> 3. -- NATURE AND PROPERTIES OF THE SUBSTANTIAL FORM</b><p>

Contrasted with primordial matter, or the passive principle
of all things, there is in them all an active principle called
substantial form.  It is the form that causes all beings to be what
they are, that ranges them in determinate species.  Unlike matter,
it is not the same everywhere, but is found with a greater
or less degree of perfection according to the excellence of the
being it constitutes.  There is therefore a countless multitude
of substantial forms correlative to the multiplicity of things.<p>

Inorganic bodies possess forms of the lowest order, and we
reach more perfect forms as we ascend in the scale of beings.
In the vegetable kingdom, the form is the vegetative soul, also
called the principle of life; in animals, it is the sensitive soul,
far more perfect, material however and doomed to perish with
the animal frame to which it is joined.  In man, the substantial
form is the spiritual soul, which is, by its nature, intrinsically
independent of matter, and cannot be affected by the death of
the body.  Although changeable in its operations and capable
of development, it is, as to its essence, absolutely immutable and,
by consequence, destined to continue in existence throughout all
eternity.<p>

Besides the substantial form, Scholastics admit accidental
forms which, like color, figure, etc., are accidents which modify
the complete substance.<p>

In the foregoing section, we have already hinted at some of
the properties of the substantial form.  We have spoken of the
hierarchy of forms, corresponding to the various degrees of perfection
in primordial matter.  We have also seen that, whereas
matter is in all things the passive principle, the substantial
form is the principle of activity:<p>

"The first essential attribute of the form is to be the principle
and the source of the activity or energy which we find in
corporeal substances, now in potency, now in actual operation.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV22"><SUP>[22]</sup></a><p>

Of the remaining properties of the substantial form, the most
important are the following two:  its simplicity, and its need
of primordial matter.<p>

The latter may have been easily inferred from the exposition
given in the preceding section.  Like primordial matter, the
substantial form does not and cannot exist by itself in nature:<p>

"The material form has an innate need, and, if such a figure
be allowed, a natural desire, 'appetitus naturalis' for matter,
because, according to the will of the Creator, it cannot exist
without that natural complement which gives it a body, a definite
place and a sensible expression.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV23"><SUP>[23]</sup></a><p>

About this unisolable character of the substantial form perfect
unanimity does not, however, exist among the schoolmen.
All Scholastics are unanimous in maintaining that the form is
essentially joined to the matter in all corporeal things; but
whether the same holds true of spiritual beings is a very controverted
question.  We have seen how Duns Scotus, following lbn
Gabirol and the Franciscan school, attributes matter to all
beings, and terms <i>materia primo-prima</i> what might be described
as immaterial matter.<p>

The great majority of Scholastic philosophers reject Duns
Scotus's theory on this point, and affirm with St. Thomas that,
in spiritual beings, form exists without matter.  But as, according
to St. Thomas, matter, and not form, is the principle of
individuation, it follows that there cannot exist two angels
of the same species.  St. Thomas unequivocally admits the
inference:<p>

"Si ergo angeli non sunt composti ex material et forma, ut
dictum est supra, sequitur quod impossibile sit, esse duos angelos
unius speciei:  sicut etiam impossibile esset dicere, quod essent
plures albedines separatae, aut plures humanitates, cum albedines
non sint plures, nisi secundum quod sunt in pluribus
substantiis."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV24"><SUP>[24]</sup></a><p>

This deduction might lead us to conclude that, at the death
of the body, human souls will be deprived of the principle that
made them separate individuals and will be one and the same.
Such a conclusion would either overthrow St. Thomas's theological
view of eternal life, or be a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of his
theory of form.  But he meets the objection with a most remarkable
subtlety by saying that the souls of men will ever
remain distinct, because, although they will be separated from
their material frames, they will still retain a certain <i>habitudo
ad corpus</i> which will be sufficient to distinguish them from other
souls.<p>

The remaining property of the substantial form is its simpllicity.
It has been remarked that primordial matter, although
it is the principle of quantity and divisibility, possesses a certain
simplicity.  It is simple in its essence and essentially multiple
in its parts.  The substantial form is likewise simple in its
essence, but, unlike primordial matter, it is endowed with simplicity
as regards its parts.<p>

On this point an explanation seems, however, indispensable.
All material beings fall under two great classes:  they are either
organic or inorganic.  An organic being is admitted by all Scholastics
to be really one hence it possesses but one form but
inorganic beings are not endowed with the same character of
unity.  They are merely aggregates of simple parts, called molecules
or atoms, each of which has its own individual existence.
It is therefore to the molecule or to the atom that the simplicity
of form belongs.<p>

Simplicity of form understood in this manner has been unanimously
accepted in the school; but a certain number of philosophers
have thought it necessary to admit in organic beings some
subordinate forms destined, not to destroy the simplicity which
the substantial form possesses, but to give more consistency to
some points which, in the ordinary Scholastic doctrine, seemed
to be inconsistent.<p>

The doctrine of the plurality of forms was maintained by
Henry of Ghent.  He admitted in man, besides the rational
soul, a subordinate form, which he named <i>forma corporeitatis</i>
or <i>mixtionis</i>, and to which lie attributed the function of causing
the great variety of our organs and the substantial organization
of matter.  He proved its existence by the following argument:<p>

"Aliter enim nihil homo in generations hominis generaret
substantiale, sed tantummodo corrumperet.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV25"><SUP>[25]</sup></a><p>

This <i>forma corporeitatis</i> was said to exist in the embryo before
the appearance of the spiritual soul, and to continue to
exist in the body after death, until decomposition takes place.
Not long afterwards the same doctrine was rendered famous
by Duns Scotus.  This subtle thinker maintained that the substantial
form determines matter to a mode of being, but does
not determine it perfectly, and leaves in it a certain potentially,
or aptitude for a higher form.  And when matter arrives at the
possession of this higher form, the inferior form continues to
be present; so that, the more perfect the matter is, the greater
the plurality of forms with which it is endowed.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV26"><SUP>[26]</sup></a><p>

The same view appeared, in a more or less modified form, in
later Scholastic thought. Lessius, Conninck, Mayr and others
admitted in animals a certain number of partial forms, which
they called forms of the bones, of the flesh, of the eyes, etc.
They similarly spoke of the for~ms of leaves and roots in plants.
However, the great majority of Scholastics, following St.
Thomas, teach that living organisms cannot possess more than
one substantial form.  They assert that the <i>forma corporeitatis</i>
is impossible and unnecessary.<p>

It is impossible because if it were a substantial form animating
the body before the appearance of the spiritual soul, as its
supporters maintain, the spiritual soul, inasmuch as it would
thus be united to a substance already complete, could not be a
substantial, but only an accidental form.<p>

It is unnecessary, because, according to Scholastic philosophy,
a form of a higher order gives to the matter to which it is joined
not only the characteristic properties it possesses by its nature,
but also all properties belonging to the forms of a lower order.
Our spiritual soul, for instance, gives us not only spiritual
faculties, but also the sensitive faculties of the brute and the
vegetative life of the plant.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV27"><SUP>[27]</sup></a><p>

This exposition of the theory of the substantial form demands
as a complement a few words about a formula often met with
in Scholastic treatises:  <i>Forma educitur e potentia materiae.</i><p>

With the exception of the human soul, all substantial forms
are intrinsically dependent on matter, and, for this reason, are
called material.  Still, they do not exist in matter actually, but
potentially; for otherwise changes would be only accidental, not
substantial.  These forms are not created, inasmuch as creation
is the production of a being from nothing, and substantial forms
are produced out of pre-existing matter.  Now, observing what
occurs in substantial changes, we see that, in order that the
change may take place, it must be accompanied by some determinate
conditions.  On the appearance of these conditions a
new substance is produced.  This mode of production is what
Scholastics call eduction out of the potency of matter.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV28"><SUP>[28]</sup></a>  The
spiritual soul alone is not educed in this manner.  Being by its
nature spiritual, it is intrinsically independent of the body and
is created immediately by God.<p>
<p>

<b><a name="4">SECTION</a> 4. -- MODERN SCIENCE AND THE CONSTITUTION OF MATTER</b><p>

It is only with the greatest reserve that one can enter on discussing
the constitution of matter.  So many brilliant minds
have grappled with this stupendous problem, only to give up its
solution in despair, that many think it a mere waste of time to
try to drag Nature's secret from her pent-up bosom.<p>

Such a proceeding, however, is but the position of despair
and can hardly be justified.<p>

Any existing thing can be understood, because to understand
(<i>intus legere</i>) is to know a thing as it is, to read its most
intimate nature.  It is not meant by this assertion that, in our
actual condition, we can be omniscient.  Things which do not
fall within the sphere of our experience will forever remain
unknown to us; but, in the constitution of this material world,
there is apparently nothing lying beyond the grasp of our intellectual
powers.  An adequate explanation of the constitution of
matter does not therefore seem an impossibility, although we
frankly admit that it has not been yet reached, and we doubt
whether our triumph on this point will ever be complete.<p>

It has always seemed to us that Dynamism is somewhat fanciful,
and the relatively small number of followers it has gained
among men of science cannot but confirm us in the same view.<p>

According to P. G. Tait,<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV29"><SUP>[29]</sup></a> the most fatal objection to which
it is exposed is that it is incapable of explaining inertia, a
distinctive -- perhaps the most distinctive -- property of matter.
This remark is not absolutely devoid of value, as the manner in
which Dynamism accounts for inertia seems rather arbitrary.
Still, we do not think that Tait does full justice to his opponents'
view, nor can it be maintained that the dynamic explanation
of inertia is altogether valueless.<p>

According to Dynamism, nothing exists in nature but centers
of force, whose essence is to act.  The action of one of these
centers will be prevented from producing its natural effect if it
is counteracted by the resistance of another force of equal and
opposite value.  And thus the state of equilibrium will arise
and will be a mode of tension.  Inertia is thus explained in this
system not by the absence, but by the equilibrium of forces.<p>

A greater deficiency of Dynamism is perhaps its incapability
of explaining extension.  The centers of force it admits in
nature are unextended.  By being conglomerated in countless
numbers, they give rise to an apparent, illusory extension, in the
same way as points, placed side by side, may lead us to believe
in their forming continuous letters.<p>

The comparison just given, first proposed by Boscovich himself,
simply ignores the difficulty.  Points placed side by side
may lead us to believe in their forming continuous letters, provided
each of them possesses a certain extension.  If the points
are altogether unextended; if, as regards extension, each one is
nothing, their sum will also be nothing, and no illusion of continuous
letters will be possible.  This is precisely what takes
place in Boscovich's system.  His centers of force either are in
contact with one another or they are not.  If they are, they
co-penetrate one another, and there is no extension.  If they
are not -- besides the fact that the so-called heresy of distance
action is then involved -- we have a series of points, none of
which has extension; and as each one, in so far as extension is
concerned, is thus nothing; as between them there is only void
space, which is equally nothing, we cannot conceive how from
the union of those countless nothings a something -- even as an
illusion -- can arise.<p>

The atomistic theory presents likewise a large number of difficulties
that baffle our powers, of observation and reasoning and
leave us face to face with the dreadful sight of our utter
insignificance.  Mere atoms in the universe of matter, we took pride
in our intellectual omnipotence.  We looked on the towns we
had built, the rivers we had spanned, the oceans we had crossed.
We saw with delight thunder and lightning yield to our caprice.
We then called ourselves the kings and lords of Nature.  Undeceive
thyself, 0 man! thy body is but an atom and thy mind
is powerless.  The lowliest fact of nature is for thee a mystery,
and the more thou shalt study, the more clearly shalt thou see
that ignorance is thy destined lot.<p>

Ancient Atomism admitted nothing but atoms and void space.
In order to avoid the assumption of distance action, the hypothesis
of a fluid called ether was subsequently introduced.  A
mere hypothesis at first, when invoked to explain only the phenomena
of light, the theory of ether was strengthened almost
indefinitely when Clerk Maxwell showed that the phenomena of
the electromagnetic field can be explained by an ether identical
in nature with the luminiferous medium.<p>

The great discovery of the English scientist was still further
confirmed by the experiments of Hertz, who detected the existence
and measured the speed of the electromagnetic waves, thus
laying the foundation upon which the edifice of wireless telegraphy
has recently been erected.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV30"><SUP>[30]</sup></a><p>

There seems thus not to be the slightest doubt as to the existence
of ether.  But, if we advance one step further and try to
investigate its inherent constitution, we will flnd ourselves involved
in darkness and condemned to nescience.<p>

Some physicists have regarded ether as composed of minute
particles, of a sort of atoms, infinitesimal in comparison with
those of ordinary matter, but still atoms.  This view was held
bv Lord Kelvin, by Whetham,<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV31"><SUP>[31]</sup></a> and taken as the current ether
theory by Herbert Spencer, who gave it as a proof of the unknowable
character of the reality which surrounds us in nature.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV32"><SUP>[32]</sup></a>
The same view has been defended in February, 1907, by Mr.
V&eacute;ronnet, in the <i>Revue de Philosophie.</i>  These are Mr. V&eacute;ronnet's
words:<p>

"The electrical theory obliges us to reduce matter and its
phenomena to a system of attractive and repulsive central forces,
called electrons.  These forces are obliged to act at distance,
inasmuch as they are found in the atomic or granulous state.
They form discontinuous centers, and ether itself is constituted
ky them."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV33"><SUP>[33]</sup></a><p>

It is clear that, as an explanation of distance action, ether,
thus understood, simply shifts the question.  If it is composed
of minute particles, these either must be separated by absolute
void, and we are thus brought back to our starting-point, or they
demand a second ether to explain the first, and we must admit
an infinity of similar fluids, of which each and all are absolutely
valueless as an interpretation of distance action.<p>

The opposite view, more generally maintained nowadays, is
that ether is not composed of atoms separated by void space,
but is itself absolutely continuous.  This conception is repeatedly
edly expressed by Joseph Larmor, in his famous work: <i>AEther
and Matter</i>:<p>

"All that is known (or perhaps need be known) of the aether
itself may be formulated as a scheme of differential equations
defining the properties of a continuum in space, which it would
be gratuitous to further explain by any complication of structure."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV34"><SUP>[34]</sup></a><p>

The same conception is also entertained by Sir Oliver Lodge,
who sums up in the following words his own view on the subject:<p>

"As far as we know, it (ether) appears to be a perfectly
homogeneous incompressible continuous body, incapable of being
resolved into simpler elements, or atoms; it is, in fact, continuous,
not molecular."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV35"><SUP>[35]</sup></a><p>

Now, is this second view in any way more satisfactory than
the first?  Our knowledge of nature shows us that the essential
difference existing between solids, liquids and gases, is due to
the greater or less degree of continuity of their structural particles.
In the gaseous state a molecule freely passes from one
molecular system into another.  A diminution of temperature
lessens the vibratory motion of the molecules, which are then
reduced to a definite system, and are limited in their motion by
the molecules surrounding them.  The result is the liquid state.
A further decrease of temperature draws the molecules still
nearer to one another.  Each one enters the sphere of action of
the others, losing thereby the possibility of translatory movement,
and becoming limited to orbital motion.  A material
object becomes therefore more and more solid in proportion as
its continuity increases.  If ether be perfectly continuous, it
must be incomparably more solid than any other object.  That
this is not the case is almost an evident truth, inasmuch as if
ether were endowed with such a degree of solidity, it is inconceivable
how movement in it would be possible.<p>

Modern physicists reply to this objection by saying that we
must not conceive ether as an ordinary material substance:
"The properties of aether, says Sir Oliver Lodge, must be somewhat
different from those of ordinary matter."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IV36"><SUP>[36]</sup></a>  We doubt
whether this remark will seem convincing.  Ether is either material,
or it is not.  If it is material, it must be, like matter,
composed of particles -- either continuous or discrete -- and the
laws which apply to matter in general must apply to it also.  If,
on the other hand, it is not material, it is inconceivable that it
may act upon matter, or be a connecting-link between atoms.<p>

Whatever may be the view we accept as to the nature of ether,
we are thus facing enigmas whose solution seems to be far beyond
the reach of our present knowledge and to be destined to
be a puzzle to human thought for many a future generation.<p>

Let us not, however, conclude from these remarks that our
knowledge of nature has not been increased by science.  Although
the unknown still exists, positive results have been obtained,
especially in these last years, to such an extent that we
may seem justified in the hope that what is still mysterious for
us will be revealed to the rising generation.<p>

The first great step toward an actual knowledge of matter
was made by John Dalton.  He revived the hypothesis of atoms
to explain the fact that the elements of a compound combine in
definite proportions, and suggested that these proportions represent
the relative weight of the atoms.<p>

As the atomic weights of many elements were found to be
multiples of that of hydrogen, Prout supposed that the atom of
hydrogen was the ultimate basis from which all substances were
made.  This suggestion, however, implied that the equivalents
of all substances should be integers, which was not confirmed by
experience, and Prout's view was forcibly abandoned.  Such
was still the situation when, in 1897, J. J. Thomson detected,
in the cathode rays of a vacuum tube, corpuscles about one
thousand times smaller than the atom of hydrogen.  These corpuscles
were shown to be identical whatever might be the nature
of the tube or of the gas it contained.  Vast was the field opened
to science by this astounding revelation.  The newly-discovered
corpuscles were found to be atoms of electricity, were called
electrons, and recognized as the long-sought-for ultimate basis of
matter, as the sub-atoms which, grouped in various ways, give
rise to the chemical atoms of all material objects.<p>

The existence of the electrons has been repeatedly evidenced
by experience, and it has received a strong confirmation by the
recent discovery of radio-active substances.<p>

The first observations on radio-activity were made by Becquerel,
who, in 1896, discovered that compounds of uranium
affect photographic plates through an opaque covering.  The
labors of Mr. and Mrs. Curie, of Mr. Rutherford, and other
distinguished men of science, have thrown the desired light on the
subject.<p>

It is now well known that uranium, radium, thorium, and a few other 
metals constantly emit three types of rays, known as the <b>alpha</b>, 
<b>beta</b>, and <b>gamma</b> rays.  The <b>beta</b> rays have been 
most successfully studied, and are known to consist of negative 
corpuscles, or electrons, projected with the velocity of light.  The 
<b>alpha</b> rays have been shown to consist of positively charged 
bodies, projected with a velocity of about one tenth of the velocity of 
light.  The <b>gamma</b> rays are the only ones whose nature is not yet 
fully known. The results of experience incline us to believe that they 
are analogous to Rontgen rays and consist of wave-pulses traveling 
through ether with incredible velocity.<p> 

The study of radio-active substance has also made known the
fact that not only atoms are divisible and composed of electrons,
but that real changes take place in the atoms themselves, by a
process of disintegration, followed by a regrouping of the electrons,
and that new substances thus arise from elements chemically
simple.<p>

From uranium and thorium products have been obtained,
considerably more active than those metals themselves.  To these
new substances the names Of uranium-X and thorium-X have
been given.  But further observation has shown that these
highly active products little by little lose their activity, and that
the metals from which they were obtained regain at the same
time the energy they had temporarily lost.<p>
<p>

These interesting phenomena have been explained by the fact
that all radio-active substances have high atomic weights, are
therefore of a great complexity, and thus very instable.  They
constantly undergo a process of disintegration of which their
radio-activity is the result.  One or more particles are detached
from the atom, and the atomic equilibrium is thus momentarily
lost.  Finally, the electrons arrange themselves differently
attain a new temporary equilibrium, and give rise to the substances
stances known as thorium-X and uranium-X.<p>

No doubt is therefore to be entertained as to the real changes
that take place in the atoms themselves.  And these changes
bring to our minds the possible realization of the dreams of the
Mediaeval alchemists, at which, for so long a time, we have been
wont to smile.  If the atom is a complex structure which, on
the occurrence of certain conditions, is disintegrable, there is
nothing absolutely impossible in the transmutation of one metal
into another.  The only question is to bring about the conditions
which the atomic disintegration necessitates.  Do such
conditions exist for all chemical elements?  We are not inclined
to believe it, but their existence is not an impossibility,
and the hope of the Mediaeval alchemist was not so preposterous
as we have been taught to believe.<p>

The facts which modern science may look upon as established
truths are the following:<p>

All substances, physically considered, are composed of molecules,
which may be termed physical units, contain one or more
chemical atoms, and, by their incessant motion, give rise to heat
and other physical phenomena.<p>

The molecules are composed of atoms, or chemical units,
which, by their regrouping in different manners, give rise to the
various. compound substances and are indivisible by chemical
processes.<p>

Finally, these atoms are nothing but groups of ultimate units,
or electrons, which are the same for all substances, and, by their
arrangement in different ways, form the simple elements which,
until recently, had been believed ultimate.<p>

The recent views as to the structure of the atoms, which we
have briefly described, present a certain likeness to the Scholastic
theory of matter and form.  This theory, by means of some
modifications, might even be brought into perfect harmony with
these Scientific results.<p>

The modifications I have in view are the following:<p>

Let us call primordial matter the mass of electrical units, or
electrons, which have been shown to be, the ultimate groundwork
work out of which all material elements are built.<p>

Let us call substantial form the different arrangements of
these ultimate units, to which the variety of material substances
is due.<p>

Primordial Matter will thus be the same in all things.  The
diversity of nature of the various substances will be due to the
substantial form.<p>

Our theory will be more in harmony with the spirit of Aristotle,
who, in explaining matter and form by means of brass
and a statue, implies that it is a real entity, and not an abstraction,
that he has in view.<p>

All the facts upon which the Scholastic doctrine of matter
and form is based will be satisfactorily explained.  The stability
of quantity under all modifications of bodily substances will be
accounted for by the fact that the ultimate units, although
arranged in different ways, are still present in the same number.<p>

As for the hypothesis of substantial changes in chemical combinations,
it must be frankly abandoned.  The atom of water
must not be regarded as a homogeneous substance, but as a mere
juxtaposition of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen.  The
permanence of the elements in the compound is universally
admitted by chemists to-day.  It is involved in the electron
theory and has received a new confirmation from the phenomena
connected with radio-activity.  A study of the compounds of
radio-active metals has shown that the rate of emission of the
radiations depends only on the quantity of the element present,
and is not affected by the amount of inactive substance which
the compound contains.  It is thus made clear that in a metallic
compound we have not a substance composed of homogeneous
atoms, but that the very atoms of the simple elements are juxtaposed
and form new molecules.  To Farges's objection that, in
the case of a mere juxtaposition, the dissolvents of the simple
elements should be effective, we will answer that dissolution is
a physical -- not a chemical -- process, that dissolvents can act
only on physical units or molecules, and that the atoms which,
by their juxtaposition, form these molecules, being chemical
units, are separable only by chemical processes.<p>
