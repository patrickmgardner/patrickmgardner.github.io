The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter V:  Scholastic Psychology</h1><hr><p>

<b><a name="1">SECTION</a> 1. -- THEORY OF ABSTRACTION</b><p>

Experimental Psychology is a new-born science still seeking
its definite path.  After numerous hesitations and partial
failures, it has come to the conviction that its true aim is not
to supplant the old metaphysical psychology, but to walk side
by side in the most peaceable manner.  Experimental psychologists
know full well to-day that the worth of the results they
will obtain will be inversely proportional to the metaphysical
preoccupations they cherish.  Wiser than their older brethren,
they limit themselves to measuring on the skin of the forehead
the degree of fatigue produced by an intellectual work, and
abstain from all hypotheses concerning the materiality or the
spirituality of the mind.<p>

Metaphysical psychology enjoys therefore an independent
existence.  It remains a branch of philosophy, whereas its
younger sister is a positive science.<p>

Scholastic psychologists adhere to Aristotle's definition of the
soul: <i>"Anima est actus primus corporis physici organici,
potentia vitam habentis,"</i> regard the soul as the substantial form
of the body, and maintain that it is essentially simple, spiritual
and immortal.<p>

Their proofs of the spirituality and of the immortality of the
soul will find their place at the end of the present chapter.
Before we expound them, it is necessary to discuss a question
which may be said to lie at the very foundation of Scholastic
psychology:  the question of abstraction.<p>

The theory which regards the mind as capable of abstracting
from all particular determinations and of forming general ideas
has received in modern times many severe blows.  The celebrated
British philosopher, George Berkeley, regards the overthrow
of that theory as a necessary presupposition of his system.
In the Introduction to his Principles of Human Knowledge, he
gives, in a somewhat jocose fashion, a minute account of what
he understands by abstraction.  He tells us, for example, that,
by the abstract idea of body is meant "body without any particular
shape or figure, without covering, either of hair, or
feathers, or scales, etc., nor yet naked: hair, feathers, scales and
nakedness being the distinguishing properties of particular
animals, and for that reason, left out of the abstract idea."<A HREF="perrierg.html#V1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a>  He
thereupon confesses that he cannot, by any effort of thought,
conceive the abstract idea thus described.  His conclusion is
that an abstract general idea is an absurdity and that the only
ideas we are entitled to regard as general are particular ideas
which are made to represent or stand for all other particular
ideas of the same sort.<A HREF="perrierg.html#V2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a><p>

Berkeley's rejection of abstraction rests upon a lamentable
confusion which has originated in Locke and pervaded the whole
body of modern philosophy:  the confusion of the two terms
Phantasm and Idea.<p>

A writer who feels little sympathy for the schoolmen, John
Stuart Mill, confesses that they were unrivalled in the construction
of technical language, and that their definitions have
seldom been altered but to be spoiled.<A HREF="perrierg.html#V3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a>  Nowhere perhaps does
his remark apply more justly than in the present case.<p>

A phantasm is the imaginary representation of a particular
object previously perceived.  It is a kind of mental picture
which reproduces more or less faithfully what we have experienced
in the past.  Besides the power of reproduction, we
possess the faculty of combining the objects of our previous
experience in an infinite variety of forms.  Now an imposing
structure we have admired during the day is present to our
mind.  We endeavor to reproduce it faithfully, to reconstruct
one by one its minutest details.  One moment has elapsed and
our imagination is wandering in the most capricious fashion.
Horace's monster sits triumphingly on the ruins of the monument
so carefully constructed in the previous instant, and which
has now crumbled to pieces and disappeared forever with the
instant of time which brought it forth.  The range of our
imagining power is thus unlimited.  Each one of our mental
pictures, however, represents one single particular object.  However
blurred may be the image, however indefinite its features,
it is always singular.  I cannot form a mental picture of a
triangle without giving it a definite size and shape, by which
it becomes one individual, distinguishable from all other possible
triangles.<p>

It is to the phantasm thus described, and improperly called
idea, that Berkeley's criticisms apply.  That ideas of this sort
cannot be abstract goes without saying.  No triangle can be
imagined that is not either scalene, isosceles or equilateral; no
body that is not either covered or naked.  But it is not an idea
of this sort that the great masters of Scholasticism considered
as the product of abstraction.<p>

Besides the power of reproducing and combining our past
sensations -- a power we possess in common with the lower
animals -- there exists in us a faculty of conceiving the universal
as such, of forming true ideas.<p>

The idea, which, to avoid all confusion, it would perhaps
be better to call concept, is no mental picture whatever.  It is a
notion of our mind, the knowledge of what something is.  We
know that a triangle is a geometrical figure consisting of three
sides and three angles.  This knowledge is the idea of the
triangle.  It is clear and distinct, and is also universal, inasmuch
as it applies to all triangles we may happen to conceive.
It is an abstract idea, because it is not limited, like the phantasm,
to one particular object, but may be truly predicated of a
whole class.  The essential characteristics which separate it
from the phantasm may be reduced to the following three:<p>

1.  The idea is one.  The idea of a triangle is one and the
same for all possible triangles.  The phantasm, on the contrary,
is multiple.  The imaginary picture of a right triangle is unlike
that of a scalene triangle.<p>

2.  The idea is universal, inasmuch as we predicate it of all
existing and possible objects of a class; the phantasm is singular
and concrete, because it applies to a determinate object and to
no other.<p>

3.  The idea is necessary and immutable.  The elements of
the concept of a triangle are invariably three sides and three
angles.  The phantasm is mutable and contingent.  It changes
as rapidly as the objects which present themselves to our senses.<A HREF="perrierg.html#V4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a><p>

The confusion we have thus described may be readily accounted
counted.  Our intelligence cannot easily operate without
its concomitant phantasm.  Although a reasoning about a triangle
might be effected without the help of a sensible image,
it could not be but at the cost of the most strenuous mental
efforts.  This is the reason why text-books on geometry exhibit
sensible images side by side with the demonstrations.  It is the
reason why Locke and the whole British empirical school have
been led to a confusion which even such a clear-minded man
as Berkeley has been unable to detect.<p>

One of the most interesting pastimes of a scholar is the
perusal of the works of the great masters of human thought
with the purpose of reading between their lines what they
themselves have not read, of deducing from their principles the
logical consequences they have not deduced.  Berkeley in particular
may offer as some delicious hours of entertainment.
Talented as he was, he could not but recognize that the conceptions
of our minds are not copies of sensible impressions, that
the ideas of God and of the soul are not mere reproductions of
the data of sense-experience.  Unwilling, however, to give up
his theory of ideas, he thought he could save his position by
using the word notion:<p>

"So far as I can see," said he, "will, soul, spirit, do not stand
for different ideas, or in truth for any idea at all, but for something
which is very different from ideas, and which, being an
Agent, cannot be like unto, or represented by, any idea whatsoever.
Though it must be owned at the same time that we have
some notion of soul, spirit, and the operations of the mind, such
as willing, loving, hating, inasmuch as we know or understand
the meaning of these words."<A HREF="perrierg.html#V5"><SUP>[5]</sup></a><p>

We must confess that in these few lines the author of the
<i>Principles</i> utterly overthrows the elaborate controversy of his
Introduction.  Let him call his idea phantasm and his notion
idea, and his agreement with us will be absolutely perfect.  He
has thus proved that an abstract phantasm is an impossibility,
which we readily grant him.  He has proved nothing against
the Scholastic doctrine of abstraction, and would even probably
admit with us that his notions of soul and spirit are truly
general, and that they apply to all existing spirits or souls.<p>

Closely related to the theory of phantasms and ideas, is the
division of our mental faculties into organic and inorganic.<p>

Organic faculties are those we possess in common with the
lower animals.  In their nature and operations, they depend
upon our bodily organs.  Such are the imagination and the
sensitive memory.  Inorganic faculties, on the other hand, depend
upon the soul alone.  They are essentially spiritual, and
would continue to exist and to operate if our mind were separated
rated from its bodily frame.<p>

Upon this classification of our mental powers is based the
essential distinction maintained by Scholastics between men and
brutes.  Lower animals possess only organic faculties.  They
can form phantasms, but no ideas.  They never reach the universal
because they lack intelligence, by which alone the universal
is reached.<p>
<p>

<b><a name="2">SECTION</a> 2. -- NATURE OF THE HUMAN SOUL</b><p>

Scholastic philosophers regard the soul as the substantial form
of the body, from which it is intrinsically independent, though
united with it in a manner characterized as substantial and
personal.<p>

By the intrinsical independence of the body is meant that the
soul is an activity by itself, that it is not determined by material
conditions, and hence that it will continue to exist and
to exercise its operations after the death of the body.<p>

By the substantial and personal union is meant:  (a) that the
human compound is a substance by itself; and (b) that man
is the compound, and not the soul alone.  The nature of this
union is very clearly expressed by St. Thomas in the following
formula:  "In each one of us, by the soul and body, is constituted
a double unity, of nature and of person," <i>"ex anima
et corpore, constituitur in unoquoque nostrum duplex unitas,
naturae et personae."</i><A HREF="perrierg.html#V6"><SUP>[6]</sup></a><p>

The doctrine of intrinsical independence separates Scholastic
philosophy from materialism.  The doctrine of substantial and
personal union sets it apart from the dualistic systems of Plato
and Descartes, which regards man as a spirit accidentally united
with the body, and governing it as the pilot governs his vessel.<p>

The human soul is further described as possessing the three
characteristics of simplicity, spirituality and immortality.<p>

The proofs of the simplicity of the human soul may be condensed
in the following form:  The nature of a being is known
from its operations.  The operations of the soul are essentially
simple.  Hence the soul itself is by nature essentially simple.<p>

Examples of simple operations of the soul may be adduced
and multiplied at will.  There are the simple ideas of being,
truth, virtue and the like, which cannot, by any effort of
thought, be conceived as divisible.  There are the intellectual
acts of judgment, which presuppose a simple subject and can
hardly be explained in any other hypothesis.  If the mind
which apprehends the subject and the predicate is not one and
indivisible, we have no judgment whatever, but merely two
different impressions without any possible connection.  Kant
was perfectly aware of this truth when he formulated at the
basis of his philosophy the principle that experience by itself
furnishes only detached and unconnected facts, and that no
judgment is possible without a mental synthesis.<p>

The doctrine of the simplicity of the soul has been attacked
by David Hume in a most ingenious manner.  He describes it
as a true atheism, capable of justifying all those sentiments for
which Spinoza is "so universally infamous."<p>

"There are in my experience," says he, "two different systems
of being, to which I suppose myself under a necessity of assigning
some substance, or ground of inhesion.  I observe first the
universe of objects or of body:  the sun, moon and stars; the
earth, seas, plants, animals, men, ships, houses, and other productions
either of art or nature.  Here Spinoza appears, and
tells me that these are only modifications; and that the subject,
in which they inhere, is simple, incompounded, and indivisible.
After this I consider the other system of beings, viz.,
the universe of thought, or my impressions and ideas.  There I
observe another sun, moon and stars; an earth, and seas, covered
and inhabited by plants and animals; towns, houses, mountains,
rivers; and in short everything I can discover or conceive in the
first system.  Upon my enquiry concerning these, Theologians
present themselves, and fell me, that these are also modifications,
and modifications of one simple, uncompounded, and indivisible
substance.  Immediately upon which I am deafened
with the noise of a hundred voices, that treat the first hypothesis
with detestation and scorn, and the second, with applause and
veneration.  I turn my attention to these hypotheses to see
what may be the reason of so great a partiality, and find that
they have the same fault of being unintelligible, and that as
far as we can understand them, they are so much alike, that it
is impossible to discover any absurdity in one, which is not common
to both of them.  We have no idea of any quality in an
object, which does not agree to, and may not represent a quality
in an impression; and that because all our ideas are derived
from our impressions.  We can never, therefore, find any repugnance
betwixt an extended object as a modification, and a single
uncompounded essence, as its substance, unless that repugnance
takes place equally betwixt the perception or impression of that
extended object, and the same uncompounded essence.  Every
idea of a quality in an object passes through an impression; and
therefore every perceivable relation, whether of connexion or
repugnance, must be common both to objects and impressions."<A HREF="perrierg.html#V7"><SUP>[7]</sup></a><p>

The objection so clearly exposed by Hume, and which, from
his own point of view, seems unanswerable, loses much of its
force if we bear in mind the distinction pointed out above
between ideas and phantasms.  The phantasm, being a copy of
a previous impression, is no doubt composed of parts, just as
well as the impression is.  If I picture in my mind the frontispiece
of Columbia University, ten different columns stand there
before me, the length of each of which may be divided into two
parts; and these may again be subdivided at least as easily as
the real columns could be.  I believe everybody would agree
with Hume on this point; but such are not the operations from
which the simplicity of the soul is deduced.  The sun, moon
and stars Hume describes as existing in his universe of thought
are as truly multiple as those of the universe of nature.  The
rivers he imagines are made of drops of water, the trees of
branches and leaves.  But the conclusion to which he is led by
these considerations, his conviction that the soul is not simple,
but divisible like the universe of matter; is that conviction
divisible also?  Can it be mentally cut into two parts, two half-
convictions; or, similar to the river, is it made up of an infinite
number of drops of conviction?  These are, however, the
absurdities from which we cannot escape if we are unwilling to
admit the essentially simple character of intellectual ideas.<p>

A great number of concepts, it is true, are in a certain sense
divisible.  Upon their divisibility is based the Scholastic
division of concepts into simple and complex.  Complex concepts
are made up of several simple elements.  The concept of<p>

man, for example, may be resolved into the elements of animal
and rational.  This sort of division is, however, quite different
from that of material beings, or of their reproduction in our
mind.  The red surface I see or imagine may be divided into
two red surfaces, identical in nature with the first, and differing
from it only in quantity.  The elements of the concept of
man are of an entirely diverse order.  They are not merely two
halves of a whole.  They differ from each other and from the
whole in quality, and the entire process of division rests upon
their specific differences.  But as qualitative division cannot,
like quantitative division, be continued <i>ad infinitum,</i> we must
finally arrive at essentially simple concepts, and conclude that
they are produced by an essentially simple being.<p>

The questions of the simplicity and of the spirituality of
the soul, although closely connected, must be carefully distinguished.
Every spiritual being is simple; but a simple being
is not necessarily spiritual.  Scholastic text-books give as an
instance of a simple, non-spiritual being the soul of the lower
animals, which depends upon the body in all its operations,
comes into existence with the body, and ceases to be as soon
as the body dies.<p>

The spirituality of the human soul may be defined as its
intrinsical independence of matter.  In virtue of that independence,
it is not affected by the death of our organism, it does
not disappear with our last breath.  When this mortal life of
ours comes to an end, our spirit springs forth; and, free from
material bonds, starts a new and purer life, a life that shall
know no death.<p>

The spirituality of the soul is proved from the nature of
its faculties:  the intelligence and the will.  These faculties
have for objects the universal and the necessary.  It is to the
universal as such, to a nature conceived with an absolute -- not
an individual character, that our intelligence tends.  It
studies the essence of the object, abstracting from the individual
characteristics of "this"  object.  A peculiar aspect of
the universal is its necessity.  This necessity, human intelligence
does not fail to grasp.  It directs its efforts to the immutable
aspects of things, and abstracts from the contingent
character they possess as individuals.<p>

Our will likewise tends to the universal manifested in the
form of the absolute good.  No limited and relative good can
satisfy us.  It is in the union with an absolute perfection that
out will would rest, that it would find its perfect happiness.
Now, these characters of universality and necessity unequivocally
separate our mental faculties from the pure forces
of matter.  Matter is essentially individual, and envelops in
individual conditions all objects of which it is an essential
constituent.  Our mental faculties are thus independent of matter,
and the soul, the substance they constitute, is necessarily endowed
with the same independence.<A HREF="perrierg.html#V8"><SUP>[8]</sup></a><p>

Several other arguments of lesser importance are adduced to
confirm the same view.  The act of self-consciousness, for
example, is said to separate the soul from all material agents;
for, whereas matter can act upon itself only in the sense that
a certain particle can act upon another particle, the human
mind can and does reflect upon itself in such a manner that the
Ego reflecting and the Ego reflected upon are one and the
same.<A HREF="perrierg.html#V9"><SUP>[9]</sup></a><p>

A third proof very much insisted upon is deduced from the
contrast between the effects produced upon the intellect and the
senses by their respective objects.  When the excellence of the
object of sense increases beyond a certain limit, the organ
undergoes corruption, and is eventually destroyed.  A vivid
light impairs our eye-sight; a prolonged contemplation of the
sun may result in blindness.  Our intellect, on the contrary, becomes
keener and more penetrating when the object it ponders
becomes more sublime.<p>

The characteristics which separate sense from intellect are
reduced by Urraburu to the following six:<p>

1.  (Which is essential and the root of the others.)  Intellect
is an inorganic or spiritual faculty; sense is organic and
material.<p>

2.  Sense is found in all animals; intellect only in rational
animals or men.<p>

3.  Sense knows only the singular; intellect knows the
universal.<p>

4.  Sense extends only to material objects; intellect to immaterial
objects as well.<p>

5.  No sense knows itself or its own operation; the intellect
knows itself and its operation.
6.  The senses are corrupted by the excellence of the sensible
object; the intellect remains uncorrupted, however excellent
its object may be.<A HREF="perrierg.html#V10"><SUP>[10]</sup></a><p>

The remaining property of the soul, its immortality, follows
from the previous two as a logical consequence.  The soul, being
essentially simple, cannot, like the body, perish by dissolution
of parts; and, on the other hand, being spiritual, having its
peculiar, independent life, not being conditioned in its existence
and operations by the bodily organism, it cannot cease to exist
simply because the organism is destroyed.  The theological
belief in another life is thus not only shown to harmonize with
reason, but is deduced from the fundamental principles of
philosophy.  Whether human reason can likewise prove the
eternity of this new life, is considered a debatable question.
Maher, in his <i>Psychology,</i> answers it negatively.  As a
theologian, he believes in eternal life; as a philosopher, although he
sees no reason why the soul should ever perish, he admits that
"leaving Revelation aside and arguing solely from reason, be
does not see any perfectly demonstrable proof of the everlasting
existence of human souls." "Almighty God," adds he, "could
by an exercise of His absolute power, annihilate the human soul
as well as any other object which He has created."<A HREF="perrierg.html#V11"><SUP>[11]</sup></a><p>

I believe that most neo-Scholastics would disagree with Fr.
Maher on this point.  They would be inclined to maintain
that the human soul can be proved, not only to endure for a
certain time after death, but to endure forever.  This view is
clearly exposed and defended in the works of Urraburu.  Starting
from the ordinary arguments of the school, the learned
Jesuit demonstrates that the soul cannot perish like the body by
a natural death, and he reaches Maher's conclusion that the
soul can cease to exist only through an act of annihilation of
an all-powerful God.  But, whereas Maher stops at this point,
and leaves human reason uncertain whether God will destroy or
not the spirit he has created, Urraburu shows that such an
annihilation would involve an inconsistency in God's own
nature.  His argument may be outlined as follows:  God has
constituted the human soul in such a way that it is naturally
immortal.  If he should choose to destroy it by an act of his
will, there would be a contradiction between the creative act by
which he gave the soul an immortal nature and the destructive
fiat which would reduce it to nothingness.  As no such contradiction
can be supposed in an absolutely perfect being, the soul
will exist forever.  Urraburu corroborates his teaching by the
authority of St. Thomas.  The annihilation of the soul would
be a miracle, and a miracle never takes place except as a manifestation
of God's glory.  But, St. Thomas says, <i>"redigere
aliquid in nihilum non pertinet ad gratiae manifestationem,
cum magis per hoc divina potentia et bonitas ostendatur, quod
res in esse conservetur."</i><A HREF="perrierg.html#V12"><SUP>[12]</sup></a><p>
<p>

<b><a name="3">SECTION</a> 3. -- LOCUS OF THE HUMAN SOUL</b><p>

The title of this section suggests a venerable formula, frequently
derided nowadays and more frequently misunderstood,
the famous <i>Tota in toto, et tota in qualibet parte,</i> which has been
recently pronounced "disconcerting but to the chosen few who
have embraced a philosophy of contradictions, and rejoice in the
absurdity of the conclusions to which their reasonings conduct
them."<p>

The words I have just quoted are from Mr. Fullerton.  In a
chapter of his <i>System of Metaphysics,</i> entitled "The Atomic
Self," he exposes the semi-materialistic opinion of the plain
man about mind, and traces it back to the philosophies of the
most ancient times.  He holds that the teachings of those old
systems have become incorporated into theology and ethics, have
left their traces upon language and literature, have become a
part of the common thought of the human race, and are now
accepted by the great mass of men as self-evident truths.<p>

"Ancient philosophers believed the mind to be material and
unequivocally in the body.  It was composed of fine round
atoms, highly movable atoms, etc.  It could be inhaled and
exhaled, and might escape through a gaping wound, as wine
spouts through the rent wine-skin.  It was a kind of matter
and nothing more, having the same right to occupy space that
has any other form of matter.  Afterward it was for centuries
still in the body, but in a much more indefinite and inconsistent
fashion.  It was wholly in the whole body, and wholly in every
part."<A HREF="perrierg.html#V13"><SUP>[13]</sup></a><p>

The Scholastic formula is thus regarded by Fullerton as the
direct offspring of old materialism.  It is materialism still,
although somewhat transfigured.  It is materialism aware of it's
inner incongruity, and trying to save its own life by means
of vague subterfuges.  The mind is still located in the body,
but its presence there is regarded as immaterial.  Descartes who
emphasized the presence, but neglected its immaterial character,
located the soul in the pineal gland.  The scholastics emphasize
both sides of the inconsistent doctrine.  They "stir up the
contradiction and make it growl, striking fear to the heart of
the beholder."<p>

Fullerton's doctrine on the locus of the soul is identical with
Hume's.  Although we differ from the author of the <i>Treatise
on Human Nature</i> in many essential points, we cannot but
fully agree with him here, and even regard his teaching as
irrefutable.  Location in a determinate place is a property of
material beings, and has no sense except if applied to such.
The chair upon which I am sitting is said to be located between
the walls of my room in so far as it can give rise to tactual and
visual impressions spatially related to the impressions caused
by the walls themselves.  When we assert that the point <i>A</i> is
between <i>B</i> and <i>C,</i> we mean that a line going from <i>B</i> to
<i>C</i> would pass through <i>A</i>. Location in space, thus applied, to
material beings, is perfectly intelligible; but, as Hume and Fullerton
maintain, it loses all meaning if predicated of mind.  It sounds
nonsensical to assert that a thought is placed between a desk
and a blackboard, that ten different volitions are actually crossing
the street; but if we express the same idea in different words,
if we say that the human mind is placed in a certain portion
of our organism or in our whole body, the absurdity of the
assertion becomes less apparent and may be easily overlooked.
It exists, nevertheless, and to say that our mind is located in our
body, or that God is located everywhere -- if we take the word
located in its proper meaning -- is no less preposterous than to
say that a benevolent desire took the ferry-boat, and was slowly
carried from Now York to Brooklyn.<p>

Where is our mind then?  And where is God?  Such questions
cannot be answered but in the following way:  Our mind
is nowhere, and God is nowhere.  The "where" implying parts
outside of parts, and being a property of matter alone, cannot
be predicated of immaterial things.  And if it sounds odd to
say that spirits are nowhere, it is because we are so immersed
in material thinking that we cannot believe that a thing can
exist without material relations.  The existence of our mind is
an immediate fact of consciousness.  It is an ultimate fact upon
which all our knowledge is grounded, and which itself needs no
proof.  It is the center from which we have to start in our
investigations concerning reality.  But the relations which our
mind bears to the rest of the universe cannot be assimilated to
the relations of particles of matter.  We fully agree with Hume
and Fullerton that a philosophical system tending to localize
mind in a definite portion of space must be rejected as absurd.<p>

What becomes of the Scholastic formula then?  Must we,
without more ado, regard it as the outcome of an illogical
materialistic conception of an immaterial thing?  Some powerful
motives at once come forth and give to this view the greatest
uncertainty.  St. Thomas's doctrine of the soul, inspired by
Christian theology, is more decidedly immaterialistic than the
theories of Locke, Hume, and the whole British empirical school.
For whereas sensism resolves ideas into sense-impressions and
admits only a difference of degree between sense and intellect,
St. Thomas and the schoolmen maintain that the difference is
not of degree but of kind, that between the sensuous impression
and the intellectual thought there is an impassable chasm.  How
strange would it sound then that he who might be described as
the foremost adversary of materialism, should himself fall into
the very errors he constantly opposes!<p>

A careful study of the doctrines of St. Thomas suffices to
absolve him from all charges of materialism.  The Angelic
Doctor not only did not intend to localize the mind in a definite
portion of space, but he was as fully aware as Hume of the
evident truth that position in space is a property of matter and
of matter alone.<p>

In the <i>Summa contra Gentiles,</i> St. Thomas examines how an
intellectual substance can be united to the body, and teaches that
there are two kinds of contact:  a contact through quantity,
which is proper to material beings alone, and a contact through
virtue, which may belong to immaterial beings as well.  This
latter kind is however described as contact only metaphorically.
A spirit is said to touch only in so far as it acts, only in the
sense in which we are entitled to say that a sad news touches us:<p>

"Si igitur sint aliqua tangentia quae in quantitatis ultimis
non tangant, dicentur nihilominus tangere, in quantum agunt;
secundum quem modum dicimus, quod contristans nos tangit."<A HREF="perrierg.html#V14"><SUP>[14]</sup></a><p>

Further on, the Christian teaching of God's ubiquity compels
St. Thomas to take up the same question again.  And now as
before, his teaching is unmistakably clear:<p>

"Res autem incorporea in aliquo esse dicitur secundum contactum
virtutis, quum careat dimensiva quantitate.  Sic igitur
se habet res iucorporea ad hoc quod sit in aliquo per virtutem
suam, sicut se habet res corporea ad hoc quod sit in aliquo per
quantitatem dimensivam.  Si autem esset aliquod corpus habens
quantitatem dimensivam infinitam, oporteret illud esse ubique.
Ergo, si sit aliqua res incorporea habens virtutem infinitam,
oportet quod sit ubique.  Est igitur ubique."<A HREF="perrierg.html#V15"><SUP>[15]</sup></a><p>

We thus see that, in St. Thomas's view, the words:  God is
everywhere, simply mean that he acts upon all beings.  We also
see that the presence of the soul in the body must not be
regarded as a material presence.  It is not in the body as the
blood is in our veins.  Properly speaking, it is not in the body
at all.  It simply acts upon the body, and touches it as a piece
of bad news touches our heart.  The formula:  <i>Tota in toto et
tota in aliqua parte,</i> thus understood, loses all its material flavor.
Instead of appearing as a nonsensical collection of words, worthy
of derision and scorn, it steps forth as a flash of genius, as a
profound truth which commands our admiration and our assent.<p>
