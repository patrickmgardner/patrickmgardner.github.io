The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter VIII: Forerunners of the Neo-Scholastic Revival</h1><hr><p>

The causes which led to the downfall of Scholastic philosophy
in the fifteenth century may be classified as internal and
external.<p>

Among the external causes the most important are:
1.  The humanistic movement which, by bringing to light the
literary beauties of the pagan classics, and insisting upon the
form in which the thoughts were expressed rather than upon the
thoughts themselves, was directly opposed to the spirit which
had animated the schoolmen.<p>

2.  The rapid progress of natural science which, after having
shown the insufficiency of the old physical system, extended its
condemnation to the metaphysical principles with which this
system was only accidentally connected.<p>

3.  The rise of Protestantism which, by its opposition to the
Church of Rome, led to the rejection of the principle of authority
and incited the minds of the new generation to deny or to
question all that had been held sacred in the past.<p>

4.  The invention of printing, considered by Haur&eacute;au as the
event which gave the death-blow to Scholastic metaphysics.
During the thirteenth and fourteenth century, all instruction
was forcibly oral, and the great centers of learning, in which
Scholasticism predominated, were the only sources from which
a philosophical instruction could be obtained.  After the invention
of printing, when books became of easy access, a course
in the universities ceased to be indispensable, and a new philosophy,
systematically opposed to the teachings of the schools,
gradually found acceptance among the people.<p>

The very supporters of Scholasticism contributed, however,
more than anything else, to discredit the system they were
called to defend.  The spirit which had animated the great
masters of the thirteenth century had completely disappeared.
Vain subtlety had replaced the profound reasoning of the past.
The argument from authority, considered by St. Thomas as
the weakest, had been raised to an undue importance.  The
new scientific spirit, into which the great Scholastics of the
thirteenth century would have so eagerly entered, was opposed
with unanimity by their degenerate successors.  Instead of harmonizing
their principles with the new physical discoveries, as
Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas would have done, they opposed
with all their might the very spirit of their time.  They declared
it to be opposed to the philosophical doctrines they cherished,
and thus raised an unnecessary and unequal struggle, in
which the old Metaphysics was doomed to perish.<p>

Scholastic philosophy did not, however, completely disappear.
An important movement of Thomistic revival took place during
the sixteenth century and enriched Scholastic literature with
many eminent contributions.  Thomas de Vio Cajetanus (1469-
1534), Vasquez (1551-1604), Toletus (1532-1596), Fonseca
(1528-1599), and especially Suarez (1548-1617), were profound
thinkers, worthy of the great masters whose principles
they had adopted.<p>

The influence exercised by the philosophy of St. Thomas
during the seventeenth century was also considerable.  Bossuet
(1627-1704) and Fenelon (1651~-1715), although controlled
by Descartes to a certain extent, and sometimes regarded as
Cartesians, developed a body of doctrines which is by no means
opposed to the principles of the Angelic Doctor.  Among the
philosophical works of Bossuet, the <i>Trait&eacute; de la connaissance
de Dieu et de soi-m&ecirc;me,</i> the <i>Logique </i>and the <i>Trait&eacute; du libre
arbitre</i> are of special significance.  The philosophical doctrines
they contain are evidently inspired by the teachings of St.
Thomas.<p>

Many writers of the same period were more strictly Thomistic
still.  John of Saint-Thomas (1589-1644), Antoine Goudin
(1639-1695), Cosmo Alemanni (1559-1634), Caramuel (1606-
1682), Guerinois (1640-1703), may be counted among the most
distinguished representatives of Scholasticism.  Several of their
works have been republished or studied during the present century.<p>

During the eighteenth century, the philosophy of the schoolmen
was gradually abandoned.  The theories of Locke and
Condillac found their way into many Catholic centers.  Among
the defenders of Thomism at that time, we may mention the
Spaniard Valcarcel, who devoted his efforts to the refutation
of Descartes, Spinoza, Malebranche and Locke; the Jesuit
Barth&eacute;lemy des Bosses (1688-1738), who corresponded with
Wolf and Clarke and translated Leibniz's Theodicy; the Dominican
Roselli, whose <i>Summa Philosophica</i> is said to have inspired
the neo-Thomists of the nineteenth century.<p>

At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the philosophy
of St. Thomas had been almost completely abandoned.  Catholics
themselves were striving to build independent systems of
thought.  In Italy, the saintly founder of the Institute of
Charity, Antonio Rosmini (1797-1855) advocated a kind of
idealism which had been severely attacked by the early Roman
Thomists.  In Germany, Baader (1765-1841), Hermes (1775-
1831), Frohschammer (1821-1893), and Gunther (1783-1863)
were greatly influenced by Hegelian idealism.  Gorres himself
(1776-1848), one of the greatest German Catholics, advanced
some philosophical principles more directly connected with
spiritism than with Thomistic philosophy.<p>

In France, traditionalism was in vogue.  It was defended by
De Bonald (1754-1840), Bonnetty (1798-1879), Bautain
(1795-1867), Ventura de Raulica (1792-1861), and, in a
slightly modified form, by Lamennais (1782-1854).<p>

Some works of Ventura are, however, permeated by purely
Thomistic principles, so that their author may justly be regarded
as one of the immediate forerunners of the neo-Scholastic
revival in France.  "In Father Ventura," says Cardinal
Gonzalez, "two men may be considered.  There may be seen,
on the one hand, an enthusiastic admirer of St. Thomas, and,
at the same time, a supporter of traditionalism, a disciple of
De Maistre and De Bonald. In <i>La Philosophie chr&eacute;tienne,</i> he
is a genuine representative of Thomism, while in some other
works, he seems driven by traditionalistic principles to the very
limits of orthodoxy and reason."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VIII1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a><p>

During the first part of the nineteenth century, there were
many signs of a return to the Middle Ages.  The romantic
movement in France strove to direct literature towards Mediaeval
customs and history.  Hugo's <i>"Notre Dame de Paris,"</i>
published in 1831, contains a vivid picture of the life of Mediaeval
Paris.  In other fields of human speculation, similar attempts
were made.  The philosophers of the Middle Ages soon
became an object of general interest.  Not long after the publication
of <i>Notre Dame de Paris,</i> Victor Cousin (1792-1867)
made known to the world unknown works of Abelard and Roger
Bacon and published those learned studies about the Middle
Ages which must be regarded as one of his most genuine titles
to the gratitude of philosophy.<p>

At the same time, another eminent scholar, Charles de Remusat
(1797-1875), following the same line of research, wrote
about Abelard, Anselm and Bacon.  Barth&eacute;lemy Haur&eacute;au
(1812-1896) published his remarkable works on the Middle
Ages.  The great Scholastic philosophers were at last emerging
from the oblivion to which they had been so unjustly condemned.<p>

In other European countries, identical tendencies could
easily be discerned.  In Germany, Friedrich Schlegel (1772-
1829) had already shown the real merit of Mediaeval philosophy
in his famous <i>History of Ancient and Modern Literature</i>.
Among Catholic thinkers, a return to Thomistic principles was
then effected.  Mohler and his illustrious disciple Staudenmaier
(1800-1856), by their condemnation of all forms of
rationalism and their strict orthodoxy, prepared the minds for
the Scholastic revival which Kleutgen, Stockl and Werner inaugurated
so brilliantly in Germany.<p>

Not long afterwards, Barth&eacute;lemy Saint-Hilaire (1805-1895)
translated the works of Aristotle, and F&eacute;lix Ravaisson published
his <i>Essai sur la m&eacute;taphysique d'Aristote,</i> which greatly
contributed to impose the peripatetic speculation upon the attention
of the world.  The way was thus fully prepared for Sanseverino
and Kleutgen.<p>
