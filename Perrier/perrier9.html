The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter IX: The Neo-Scholastic Revival in Italy</h1><hr><p>

The direct initiator of the neo-Scholastic movement in Italy
was Cajetano Sanseverino, canon of Naples.<p>

Sanseverino (1811-1865) was at first an enthusiastic admirer
of Descartes.  The episode of his life which marked the
turning-point of his philosophical career has been told by many
historians.  In the year 1840, Sanseverino received the visit of
Father Sordi S. J., who had read and annotated St. Thomas's
<i>Summa Theologica.</i>  Sordi pointed out to Sanseverino the
shortcomings of Descartes's thought and the superiority of the
Thomistic principles in the solution of all philosophical problems.
Great was the struggle for the devout canon.  For
twenty years, he applied himself to a thorough study of St.
Thomas's philosophy.  At the light of the <i>Summa Theologica</i>
he read all modern writers and became more and more convinced
of their insufficiency.  The result of his investigations
was the <i>Philosophia christiana cum antiqua et nova comparata,</i>
a work which, unfinished as it is, consists of seven quarto
volumes and displays an uncommon erudition, a remarkable
knowledge of modern philosophy, and, above all, an enthusiastic
admiration for the Angelic Doctor.<p>

According to Cardinal Gonzalez, the <i>Philosophia christiana</i>
has a double defect.  With regard to its method, it presents a
somewhat awkward distribution of arguments, and, at times,
exceedingly diffuse articles.  With regard to its spirit, it is
too narrowly attached to the philosophy it defends.  Sanseverino
accepts St. Thomas's conclusions even in the minutest details,
and despises modern thought as altogether vain and worthy of
contempt.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a><p>

In spite of these defects, the <i>Philosophia christiana</i> has exercised
an immense influence upon Catholic thinkers.  For many
years, it has been the great work of neo-Scholasticism, the
fountain at whose pure waters all came to drink the spirit of the
Thomistic regeneration.  In its narrow-mindedness itself, it
has found a multitude of followers.  Too often have neo-
Scholastics shared Sanseverino's contempt for modern thought.
They have not even taken the trouble to read non-Scholastic
writers in their original works.  Why submit, indeed, to such
a wearisome task?  Had not Sanseverino done the work once
for all?  Had be not, from the narrowness of his cell, pronounced
an ultimate verdict upon modern thinking? And
thus, Sanseverino's word has been taken, not only with regard
to the exposition of modern philosophical systems, but also with
regard to his very criticisms.<p>

The <i>Philosophia christiana</i> was at first the object of violent
attacks.  Cartesians and Rosminians agreed in denouncing it.
But Sanseverino was defended by his disciple Signoriello, and
encouraged by his archbishop, Riario Sforza.  Shortly afterwards,
an Academy of St. Thomas was founded at Naples, and
honored by the approbation of Pius IX.  All seemed to indicate
that the efforts towards a Thomistic revival would be
crowned with success.<p>

The archiepiscopal see of Perusa was then occupied by
Joachim Pecci who, as early as 1858, had founded an Academy
of St. Thomas.  Pecci was in close connection with Cardinal
Sforza, with whose cooperation he had already written a refutation
of Ontologism.  He greatly sympathized with the Thomistic
revival which was taking place in Naples, and addressed a
memoir to Pius IX, asking him to declare St. Thomas patron
of the universities.<p>

At the same time, there lived, in another point of the Italian
peninsula, a remarkable man, who was destined to be the very
life of the new movement, to impose it <i>bon gr&eacute; mal gr&eacute;,</i> and
to silence all malcontents.  It was the famous Jesuit John
Mary Cornoldi.<p>

Cornoldi is undoubtedly one of the most interesting figures
of the neo-Scholastic revival.  As soon as he heard of the work
done in other places, he intended not to remain behind.  Academies
had been founded in Naples and Perusa:  he would found
in Bolonia an Academy of his own.  Unwilling, however, to be
a mere imitator, he made up his mind to create something truly
original.  The two other Academies were simply philosophical;
his would be medico-philosophical.  The <i>Academia filosofico-
medica di San Tommaso</i> was accordingly founded (1874),
in which Travaglini, Venturoli and Zanon represented science;
Cornoldi, Battaglini and Rubbini, philosophy.  The review <i>La
Scienza Italiana,</i> the organ of the new institution, has been
published until 1891.<p>

In the Roman universities, however, Thomism did not as yet
seem to gain a footing.  The philosopher most in view in Rome
at the time was the Jesuit Tongiorgi, a remarkable thinker,
sometimes called by his admirers "the Balmes of Italy." On
the whole, Tongiorgi's philosophy may be regarded as Thomistic.
The few questions in which he departs from Scholastic principles
are precisely those in which Scholastic principles are
the weakest.  He thus refuses to admit the theory of Matter
and Form as an adequate explanation of the nature of bodies,
and advocates a kind of Atomism.  Nevertheless, Tongiorgi
felt no sympathy for a revival of Thomism.<p>

Such was the state of affairs when, in 1878, Joachim Pecci
was elected Pope.  The situation was at once greatly changed.
Pius IX had sympathized with the Thomistic revival.  He had
even sent a letter of approbation to the archbishop of Naples.
In Rome, however, unwilling to vex his anti-Thomistic professors,
he had done nothing. As we shall see, the new pope
will not hesitate to act more resolutely.<p>

In the very letter in which he announced his elevation, Leo
XIII quoted from the text of St. Paul:  <i>videte ne quis vos
decipiat per philosophiam,</i> and greatly commmended the philosophy
of St. Thomas as the true philosophy.  The Roman
College at once adopted the views of the head of the Church;
and, at the solemn session by which the school year 1878-79
opened, Father Cardella, speaking in the name of all, declared
"that he would take St. Thomas as the rule and law of his
teaching."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a><p>

The pope was delighted. His Roman professors, whom he
had believed so obstinate, were as docile as children.  Before he
had said a word, they had understood and anticipated his
wishes.  So perfect seemed their dispositions!  So splendid
were their promises!  Unhappily, they were promises only, and
nothing was done.  Father Palmieri, who had taken Tongiorgi's
place, not only did not act in accordance with the papal instructions,
but applied himself to point out from his chair the
inconsistencies of St. Thomas's thought, the contradictions to
which Scholasticism necessarily leads.  As for Caretti -- Palmieri's
co-worker -- he did not dare depart a whit from his dear
Descartes, save to adopt metempsychosis.  The pope's endeavor
was decidedly a flat failure.<p>

What could be done?  Leo XIII's own brother and
operator in Perusa, Joseph Pecci (1807-1890), then advised
him to establish in Rome a free course of Thomism and to confide
it to Father Cornoldi.  The advice was judged excellent
and immediately followed.  Cornoldi arrived at Rome, proud
of the reputation he bad gained in Bolonia as a scientist and a
philosopher, and of the honorable mission he had just received
of implanting the philosophy of St. Thomas in the very capital
of the Christian world.<p>

Cornoldi's course was open to all the students of the Roman
University, and presided by the regular professors of the Roman
College, to whom was added Joseph Pecci, who was soon
made a cardinal.  The subjects discussed were chiefly physics,
psychology and metaphysics.  To all questions whatsoever,
Cornoldi, St. Thomas in hand, could answer!  In the <i>Summa
Theologica</i> was to be found the key to all difficulties of modern
science!<p>

At the same time, there began to spread a rumor that Leo
XIII was preparing an encyclical letter about Christian philosophy.
The uneasiness of the Cartesian professors was growing
day by day.  That Thomistic revival they had so much
despised when confined to Naples and Perusa, was now taking
Rome by storm.  The dreaded encyclical appeared.  Leo XIII
greatly commended the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas and
insisted upon a study of the genuine works of the great
Scholastics:<p>

"Providete ut sapientiam Thomae ex ipsis ejus fontibus
hauriatur."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a><p>

More than any other Scholastic must St. Thomas be studied
because he gathered all previously discovered truths in a great
synthetic system, which he still considerably increased:<p>

"Illorum doctrina, velut dispersa cujusdam corporis membra,
in unum Thomas collegit et coagmentavit, miro ordine digessit,
et magnis incrementis ita adauxit, ut catholicae Ecclesiae
singulare praesidium et decus jure meritoque habeatur."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a><p>

There is no part of philosophy which he has not solidly discussed:<p>

"Nulla est philosophiae pars, quam non acute simul et solide
pertractarit:  de legibus ratiocinandi, de Deo et incorporeis
substantiis, de homine aliisque sensibilibus rebus, de humanis actibus
eorumque principiis ita disputavit, ut in eo neque copiosa
quaestionum seges, neque apta partium dispositio, neque optima
procedendi ratio, neque principiorum firmitas aut argumentorum
robur, neque dicendi perspicuitas aut proprietas, neque
abstrusa quaeque explicandi facilitas desideretur."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX5"><SUP>[5]</sup></a><p>

This return to the past, however, is far from being a retrogression.
All Mediaeval vain subtleties must be discarded.  All
Scholastic teachings which are not in harmony with modern
scientific discoveries must be abandoned:<p>

"Si quid enim est a doctoribus Scholasticis vel nimia subtilitate
quesitum, vel parum considerate traditum, si quid cum
exploratis posterioris aevi doctrines minus coherens, vel denique
quoquo modo non probabile, id nullo pacto in animo est aetati
nostrae ad imitandum proponi."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX6"><SUP>[6]</sup></a><p>

Modern scientific progress must be welcomed as a benefit to
philosophy:<p>

"Non eos profecto improbamus doctos homines atque solertes,
qui industriam et eruditionem suam, ac novorum inventorum
opes ad excolendam philosophiam afferunt:  id enim probe intelligimus
ad incrementa doctrinae pertinere."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX7"><SUP>[7]</sup></a><p>

The influence of the pope's encyclical was simply immense.
The revival of Thomism, which had been limited to some isolated
efforts, was then taken seriously by most of the Catholic
thinkers.  Suffice it to mention the celebrated professor of the
Catholic University of Lille, Am&eacute;d&eacute;e de Margerie.  Mr. de
Margerie, although more than fifty years of age when the papal
encyclical appeared, at once made a thorough study of the
works of St. Thomas -- which were completely unknown to him
--and adopted his doctrine in a great many points.<p>

In Rome itself, the success of the pope was complete.  This
was due in great part to the fact that Leo XIII, instructed by
his first failure, took the precaution to corroborate his instructions
by forcible measures.  Palmieri and Caretti were discharged
from their chairs, and the new appointments made left
no doubt as to the final issue of the affair.  All understood
that this time the pope would be victorious.<p>

The men honored by the papal choice as professors of philosophy,
in Rome, were the following:  Cornoldi was made professor
at the Roman College, Zigliara at the Minerva, Lorenzelli
and Satolli at the Propaganda, Talarno at the Apollinaris.
As all these men have distinguished themselves by eminent productions,
I will say a few words about each of them.<p>

Giovanni Mari Cornoldi, S.J. (1822-1892), besides his two
great works:  <i>Institutiones Philosophitae Speculativae</i> and <i>La
Filosofia Scolastica di San Tommaso e di Dante,</i> and numerous
shorter treatises in which he defends the Scholastic principles
and attacks opposite doctrines, especially Rosminianism (Cf.
Bibliography), has contributed many articles to the <i>Civilt&agrave;
Cattolica.</i>  Less profound as a philosopher than Zigliara or
Sanseverino, he has nevertheless done the greatest service to
the neo-Thomistic cause by the very activity he has displayed.
The direct aim of his great works, as well as of his numerous
essays, is most praiseworthy.  He strove to point out the perfect
harmony existing between Thomism and science, to give a
scientific basis to neo-Scholasticism.  This is the very spirit
which has recently inspired Desir&eacute; Mercier and the Institute of
Louvain.  Unhappily, Cornoldi's efforts have not always been
intelligent and have met with little success.  He is chiefly
known to-day for his bitter criticisms of modern thought.  In
his <i>Prolegomeni,</i> he divides all philosophers into three groups:
the true philosophers, that is to say, the Scholastics; the liberal
philosophers, or those who do not accept all Scholastic doctrines;
the non-philosophers, to which group all others belong.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX8"><SUP>[8]</sup></a>
Well known is Cornoldi's phrase describing modern philosophy
as "the pathology of human reason."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX9"><SUP>[9]</sup></a><p>

Less unfair to moderns has been Thomas Zigliara, O.P.
(1833-1893).  His <i>Summa Philosophica,</i> in which he closely
adheres to St. Thomas's doctrine, has, for a long time, served
as a text-book in Catholic seminaries, and is much in use still
to-day.  His most valuable contribution to philosophy is probably
the work entitled:  <i>Della luce intellettuale.</i>  The author
refutes traditionalism and ontologism, and conclusively shows
that the ontologists have no right to invoke the authority of St.
Thomas to support their theories.<p>

Benedetto Lorenzelli, actual archbishop of Lucca, has followed
Aristotle in his <i>Philosophiae Theoreticae Institutiones.</i>
How closely he shares Cornoldi's contempt for modern thought
may be inferred from his division of philosophy into the four
following periods:  (1) a period of formation, from Thales to
Aristotle; (2) a period of decrease and perversion, from Aristotle
to Christ; (3) a period of increase and perfection, from
Christ to Thomas Aquinas; (4) a period of corruption, from
Descartes to our own day.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX10"><SUP>[10]</sup></a><p>

Francesco Satolli is a faithful disciple of Cardinal Cajetan.
At the example of the great commentator of the sixteenth century,
he chiefly applies himself to the writing of learned commentaries
on the works of the Angelic Doctor.  <i>In Summam
Theologicam Divi Thomae Aquinatis</i> is the title of three successive
treatises in which many questions of the <i>Summa Theologica</i>
are expounded and studied.<p>

In his Logic (<i>Enchiridion Philosophiae, Pars Ia, continens
logicam universam</i>), Mgr. Satolli has been like Lorenzelli, a
disciple of Aristotle.  He has been reproached with making an
excessive use of dialectical reasoning, and thus rendering "intricate
and labyrinthic" what is clear by itself.  His last work,
<i>De habitibus,</i> contains a valuable discussion of Spencer's theory
of conduct.<p>

Salvatore Talamo is chiefly known for his work, <i>L'Aristotelismo
della Scolastica,</i> one of the most valuable productions of
early Roman neo-Thomism.  The aim of the treatise is to defend
Scholastic philosophy against the unfounded reproach of
servile Aristotelism, which, for several centuries, had been almost
unanimously directed against the schoolmen.<p>

The first chapters of the work deal with the character of
Mediaeval speculation.  The author clearly shows that the philosophy
of the schoolmen, although intimately connected with
theology, had an object and a method of its own, with which
theology was not concerned.<p>

In the second part, the author studies the ground of the preference
given to Aristotle in the Middle Ages.  The reasons he
assigns are the following:<p>

1.  Aristotle was the greatest master, nay the inventor of one
of the most important branches of philosophy, the science of
logic, which studies the laws of our mind and the method we
must follow in the research of truth.<p>

2.  Aristotle's works contained a treasure of information
about all branches of human knowledge:  natural science, ethics,
politics, psychology, metaphysics, etc.<p>

3.  Aristotle gave the example of a methodic discussion and
a concise style, rejecting the beautiful garb under which Plato
often concealed the impossibility of a demonstration.<p>

4.  Finally, the Stagirite revealed to the curiosity of the Mediaeval
philosophers the origin of philosophy and its development
among the Greeks.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX11"><SUP>[11]</sup></a><p>

The enthusiasm with which the philosophy of Aristotle was
accepted was, however, far from mere slavishness.  Whenever
the Scholastics found in Aristotle some theory they judged
erroneous, they did not hesitate to reject it.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX12"><SUP>[12]</sup></a> They likewise
modified and perfected the system of the master in a great many
points.  With regard to the essential relations between the universe
and God, the final end of man, the spirituality and immortality
of the soul, etc., they taught definite doctrines which Aristotle
had denied or very imperfectly treated.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX13"><SUP>[13]</sup></a>  Their conception
of the act of creation was also essentially different from
Aristotle's conception.  Aristotle had admitted God as the
necessary cause of the world, but had regaded him simply as a
demiurge acting upon eternally preexisting matter.  The Scholastics
conceived creation as a production of the world out of
nothing.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX14"><SUP>[14]</sup></a><p>

While the Professors we have mentioned were working hard
for the success of their cause, there came into notice another
man who had not attracted the attention at first, perhaps because
he shunned public notice, who had written much, however,
and who, from the silence of his cell, proved as able a
defender of the new movement as the men who were expounding
their views from a university's cathedra.<p>

Matteo Liberatore, S.J. (1810-1892), was already an old man
at the time we consider.  His <i>Institutiones Philosophicae,</i>
published many years before, had been often reissued, and, as well
as Zigliara's Summa, have proved an excellent text-book in many
Catholic institutions.  Anticipating the pope's advice, Liberatore
had shunned all useless questions, and had defended the
essential principles of Scholasticism in a clear and elegant language.
Not satisfied with the general exposition contained in
his first work, he later took up some special topics, chiefly in the
field of Scholastic psychology, and published learned treatises,
which have been translated into various languages (cf. Bibliography).
He even made use of the dramatic form to defend his
philosophical theories, as in <i>L'autocrazia dell'ente,</i> comedy in
three acts (Naples, 1880).  His works do not evince a deep
knowledge of the philosophical thought outsidc, of Italy; but he
has mastered Italian philosophy and given thorough criticisms
of the doctrines of Gioberti and Rosmini.  The latter part of
his life was devoted to social studies.  He pointed out the way
in which the Catholic Church can accommodate itself to a certain
kind of socialism.  Finally, Liberatore was one of the
founders of the review <i>Civilt&agrave; Cattolica</i> (1850), which has not
ceased to be one of the most efficient organs of Catholic thought
in Italy.<p>

In the meantime, the success of the Roman professors was
becoming more and more complete.  In 1880, Leo XIII ordered
the preparation of a new edition of the works of St. Thomas.
At the same time, an Academy of St. Thomas was founded in
Rome itself (October 13, 1879).  It was composed of thirty
members:  ten taken from Rome, ten from the rest of Italy,
ten from other countries.  Pecci and Zigliara were chosen as
presidents.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX15"><SUP>[15]</sup></a><p>

The work of the <i>Accademia Romana di San Tommaso</i> soon
attracted the attention and the criticisms of the Italian thinkers.
It was claimed that the new Scholastics were not following the
precepts of Leo XIII, that they applied the Thomistic principles
to scientific discoveries in the most ridiculous manner, that they
had produced nothing original, save repeated attacks on Rosmini.
These charges, formulated as early as 1886 by Benzoni
in the <i>Rivista italiana di Filosofia,</i> have been taken up again by
Besse, in his pamphlet, <i>Deux centres du mouvement thomiste</i>.
The aim of Mr. Besse in this little treatise is to compare the
work done at Rome by the early neo-Scholastics with the work
done at Louvain to-day, and to show that at Louvain only something
truly philosophical has been accomplished; that the
Louvain professors alone have acted in agreement with the papal
instructions and with the necessities of our time.<p>

The most important charges formulated by Mr. Besse against
the Roman Thomists are the following:<p>

1.  On all points common to philosophy and faith, the Roman
Thomists strove to connect the natural and the supernatural,
and became mere interpreters of the Christian dogmas.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX16"><SUP>[16]</sup></a><p>

2.  They did not study modern philosophy, but uncritically
accepted Sanseverino's conclusions.  Their criticisms, therefore,
contain nothing personal, nothing serious, and have brought discredit
upon the cause their authors pretended to defend.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX17"><SUP>[17]</sup></a><p>

3.  Lacking all principles of critical method, the Roman
Thomists have not even succeeded in their interpretations of
St. Thomas.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX18"><SUP>[18]</sup></a><p>

Mr. Besse excepts from his wholesale condemnation Signoriello
for his <i>Vocabularium peripatetico-scholasticum,</i> and Talamo
for his study on Aristotle.  But these examples, the author continues,
have found no imitators.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX19"><SUP>[19]</sup></a><p>

The truth contained in Mr. Besse's pamphlet must be frankly
acknowledged.  Roman Thomists have often remained in a complete
ignorance of the spirit and the contents of modern philosophy.
Without understanding modern thinkers, they have
mercilessly condemned them.  Non-Scholastic philosophical
productions have been described as heretical; their authors,
even the most inoffensive, as men who had wilfully opposed all
rules of common sense and truth.  The neo-Scholastic movement
has thus ostracized itself from the current of modern
thought.  It has failed to attract the attention of the non-
Catholic world.  Its very existence has been, for a long time,
systematically ignored.  Only in recent years, and after taking
another direction, has neo-Scholasticism been deemed worthy of
study.  Only after neo-Kantians have become convinced that
the professors of Louvain possessed a knowledge of the Kantian
philosophy which would honor any center of learning have they
begun to ask themselves whether neo-Scholasticism could not
contain something good, whether it is not a philosophy.<p>

Mr. Besse, however, has probably overlooked a most important
fact, which might have led him to modify his sentence of condemnation.
The early Roman Thomists were not in the same
position as their followers of the present day.  Their aim was
not to impose the Thomistic revival upon the consideration of
the world of philosophy at large, but to effect its acceptance
from the part of the Catholic Church.  Only after Thomism
had gained a sure footing among Catholic thinkers could it step
boldly forward and proclaim its existence to the outside world.
This is the reason why the Roman Thomists have worked hard
and fast to show the perfect harmony of their system with the
body of revealed truths.  It is the reason why they have made
merciless attacks upon all other philosophies, and have seen a
heresy where there was at most an error.<p>

The neo-Thomists of the present day ought not to censure
too hastily the work of their older brethren.  It is the Roman
Scholastics that have firmly implanted Thomism in the Catholic
world.  They have faithfully grasped the task that lay before
them, and have fulfilled it with the greatest success.  The
means they have taken were, on the whole, the best they could
take, the only ones, perhaps, that could insure success.<p>

The early neo-Thomists we have studied have found numerous
disciples who have continued and perfected the work of the masters.
In 1879, the Lazarist Albert Barberis (1847-1896)
founded in Piacenza a Latin philosophical review, the <i>Divus
Thomas,</i> which has been the organ of neo-Scholasticism in Italy,
and in which Tornatore, Vinati, Ermoni, and other eminent
men, have published learned dissertations.  The professors of
Louvain themselves have occasionally honored the <i>Divus Thomas</i>
by their articles.  Quite recently, the publication of the <i>Divus
Thomas</i> has been interrupted.  Nobody regrets the fact more
sincerely than we do.  It is perhaps true that modern languages
are a more suitable instrument than Latin for philosophical
discussions.  All interested in neo-Scholasticism were none the less
glad to read dissertations written by modern Scholastics in the
very language of the schoolmen.  After having enjoyed the
<i>Divus Thomas</i> for so many years, we feel that its actual absence
is a real lack to Scholastic literature, and we sincerely implore
the distinguished professors of Piacenza to alter their decision
and begin their work anew.<p>

Barberis is also the author of two Latin dissertations:
<i>Positivismus ac nova methodus psychologica</i> (1887), and <i>Esse
formale estne rei intrinsecum an non?</i> (1887), which, by the
solidity of the reasoning and the depth of the doctrine, assure their
author a place among the most profound metaphysicians of
our day.<p>

Among the recent defenders of neo-Scholasticism in Italy, the
best known are:  the Jesuits Schiffini, De Maria and Salis Seewis,
and the distinguished professor of Pavia, Giuseppe Ballerini.
Santo Schiffini (1841-1906), for a long time professor at the
Gregorian University, published a complete and detailed course
of Scholastic philosophy.  His <i>Principia philosophica</i> deal with
logic and ontology; his <i>Disputationes metaphysicae specialis,</i>
with cosmology; his <i>Disputationes philosophiae moralis,</i> with
moral philosophy.  In 1888, in a learned article of the <i>Annales
de Philosophie chr&eacute;tienne,</i> Count Domet de Vorges praised
Schiffini's Ontology as the most solid and profound then existing.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX20"><SUP>[20]</sup></a>
One of the most interesting studies Schiffini's volumes
contain is an analysis of the influence of will upon belief, which
reminds us of the tenets of our pragmatists.<p>

Michael de Maria became famous in 1892, after publishing
three volumes of philosophical studies with the title <i>Philosophia
Peripatetico-Scholastica.</i>  In his criticisms of modern philosophy,
De Maria closely resembles his Roman predecessors.  In
his contempt for modern thought, he is not far from Cornoldi's
position, as may be gathered from the following passage of his
preface:<p>

"Principio quidem semper persuasum habui, philosophiam ad
tot absurda et incredibilia amplectenda in ipsa Christianae societatis
luce eo misere nostris temporibus declinasse, quod paulatim
et pedententim ab illis principiis discessit quae S. Thomas ex
Aristotele accepta mirifice illustravit et cum Christiana revelatione
composuit.  Ex quo facile erat intelligere nullam meliorem
expediendae salutis reperiri posse viam, quam ad illam
sapientiam plane reverti, a qua inconsulte admodum et temere
discessum est."<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX21"><SUP>[21]</sup></a><p>

De Maria's work, however, is excellent in many respects. Besides
its intrinsic value as an exposition of the Scholastic philosophy,
it presents a special interest on account of the profound
studies it contains about St. Thomas's doctrine on some special
topics, viz., on essence and existence,<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX22"><SUP>[22]</sup></a> on the nature of the
individual,<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX23"><SUP>[23]</sup></a> etc.<p>

Francis Salis Seewis (1835-1898) is chiefly known for his
treatise, <i>Della conoscenza sensitiva,</i> published in 1881, and a
study of the doctrines of St. Augustine, St. Thomas and Suarez
on spontaneous generation, published in 1897.  The author
studies the Scholastic doctrines from the point of view of modern
physiology and compares the teachings of St. Thomas with
the positive results obtained in our day by Helmholz, Wundt,
Weber, etc.  By his careful study of modern scientific discoveries,
Salis Seewis frankly departs from the contemptuous
neglect of the early Roman Thomists and opens to the neo-
Scholastic movement in Italy an era of progress.<A HREF="perrierg.html#IX24"><SUP>[24]</sup></a><p>

Giuseppe Ballerini, already known by a treatise on socialism
and a theological dissertation about the Eucharistic dogma, published
in 1904 a study on the principle of causality and the
existence of God, <i>Il principio di causalita e l'esistenza di Dio
di fronte alla scienza moderna</i>.  He regards the principle of
causality as the real point at issue between the Scholastics and
their opponents.  He discusses its objectivity, combats Hume's
theories, and shows the connection of the idea of cause with the
belief in the existence of God.<p>

A complete study of neo-Scholasticism in Italy should contain
the names of the Jesuits De Mandato, Remer, and Taparelli
d'Azeglio, the author of the celebrated <i>Saggio di Diritto
naturale</i>; of Prisco, Chiesa, Cappellazzi, Puccini, and of the
distinguished logician Lorenzo Schiavi.  It should not fail to mention
the accurate and painstaking edition of the works of St. Bonaventure,
begun in 1882 by the Franciscan fathers of Quaracchi,
near Florence, who have thereby done an immense service to the
cause of Scholasticism.  The same fathers are actually promising
to the learned world a critical edition of the works of Roger
Bacon.  Finally, one of them, Mariano Fernandez Garcia, has
just published a work which will be of great help for the study
of Duns Scotus's philosophy.  Its title is:  <i>Lexicon Scholasticum
Philosophico-Theologicum, in quo continentur termini, definitiones,
distinctiones et effata a B. Joanne Duns Scoto Doctore Subtili</i>.
