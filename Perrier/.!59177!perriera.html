The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter X: The Neo-Scholastic Revival in Spain, Portugal, and Spanish
America</h1>

<b><a name="1">SECTION</a> 1. -- THE NEO-SCHOLASTIC REVIVAL IN SPAIN</b><p>

Our ordinary philosophical studies in American institutions
may easily lead us to the belief that there is no such a thing as
a Spanish philosophy.  Who, among our university students,
has ever heard of a Spanish philosopher?  Who could presently
name one?  Our complete ignorance on this point must perhaps
be excused.  Some years ago, Mr. Guardia wrote an article in
the <i>Revue Philosophique</i> to prove that we are right.  He gave
it the attractive title of <i>La mis&egrave;re philosophique en Espagne,</i>
and strongly defended the thesis that Spain possesses no philosophy.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a>
The same thesis had been defended a few years before
by the Mexican priest Agustin Rivera, who had extended his
condemnation to the Spanish-speaking countries of the New
World.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a>  Few Spaniards, however, would agree with these two
men.  Patriotism is strong beyond the Pyrenees, and the assertions
tions to which it frequently leads the fiery sons of Pelayo would
sound incredible to the cool-headed Anglo-Saxon race.  It
seems that the distinguished writer Marcelino Menendez y
Pelayo has placed Spanish philosophy on equal footing with the
philosophical systems of France and Italy, and has judged it
inferior only to Greek and German speculation.  To most of
us, this judgment would seem rather bold.  It has been condemned
as too timid by William Garcia, who does not hesitate
to give Spanish philosophy the first place.  His line of reasoning
is very simple.  He summarily dismisses German philosophy
as a mere play of imagination and no knowledge of truth.  As
regards Greek philosophy, Garcia, as a genuine Scholastic, does
full justice to Aristotle; but, he adds, Aristotle has been surpassed
by St. Thomas, so that the Thomistic, or Italian philosophy,
is really the first philosophy.  Now, the Thomistic philosophy
has become Spanish by right of conquest.  Hence, it is clear
that Spanish philosophy is the first philosophy.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a><p>

Our belief as to the real worth of Spanish thought may be
greatly influenced by the point of view from which we study the
question.  A Kantian, for example, can hardly be proud of the
influence the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> has exercised on the
Spanish soil.  If, as Mr. Latinus points out, only two Spaniards,
during the nineteenth century, have judged it useful to go and
study philosophy in Germany, if the physician Nieto Serrano is
actually the only Kantian in Spain,<A HREF="perrierg.html#X4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a> all who maintain that
philosophy must flow from Koenigsberg, that we must go back
to Kant, will be apt to be as severe to Spanish thought as Rivera
and Guardia have been.<p>

A neo-Scholastic will no doubt be more indulgent.  Spain is
perhaps the only country in which the Scholastic traditions
have never been entirely forgotten.  A long time before Sanseverino
published his <i>Philosophia Christiana</i> and Leo XIII his
encyclical, distinguished Spaniards had defended the essential
principles of the Aristotelian and Thomistic philosophy.  During
the course of the nineteenth century, Spain, as we shall see,
has produced three great philosophers who are certainly among
the greatest of whom the Scholastic revival may boast.  One of
them, Urraburu, is still living; the other two, Balmes and Gonzalez,
have departed from this world many years ago, but their
works are immortal.<p>

At the end of the eighteenth century, the sensism of Locke
and Condillac was introduced into Spain and gained many disciples.
Among its best known adherents may be mentioned the
Jesuits Eximeno and Andres.  Scholasticism, however, did not
disappear altogether.  It was defended by Rafael Puigcerver,
O.P., in his <i>Philosophia Sancti Thomae Aquinatis, auribus hujus
temporis accommodata,</i> which was used as a text-book in many
institutions.<p>

Not long afterwards, Francisco Alvarado, O.P. (1756-1814),
generally known as "el fil&oacute;sofo rancio" (the rank philosopher),
acquired a great celebrity by his <i>Cartas Aristol&eacute;licas</i> and his
<i>Cartas Criticas</i>, in which he defended the philosophy of St.
Thomas against the heterodox, political, social and philosophical
theories which had been recently introduced into Spain.<p>

But the man who gave to Spanish philosophy its greatest
splendor during the first half of the nineteenth century was
undoubtedly Balmes.<p>

James Balmes was born in Vich (Catalonia) in 1810 and died
in 1848.  Completely unknown in 1840, he acquired in a few
years an immense reputation.  He alone succeeded in awakening
the interest of Europe in Spanish thought.  Besides numerous
social productions, among which must be mentioned a comparative
study of Protestantism and Catholicism with regard to
their influence upon European civilization, Balmes has written
the following philosophical works:  <i>El Criterio</i>, or a study of
the criteria of truth, which, in Mr. Turner's opinion, is his most
valuable contribution to philosophy; <i>Cartas &aacute; un esc&eacute;ptico</i>, a
collection of letters in which scepticism is most ably discussed;
