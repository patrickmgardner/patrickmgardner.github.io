The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter XIV: The Neo-Scholastic Revival in Other European Countries</h1><hr><p>

<b><a name="1">SECTION</a> 1. -- THE NEO-SCHOLASTIC REVIVAL IN HUNGARY, BOHEMIA AND THE 
NETHERLANDS</b><p>

The countries we have studied thus far are those in which
neo-Scholastic philosophy has especially flourished.  The Catholics
of the rest of Europe have not failed, however, to espouse
the views of Leo XIII, so that the Thomistic literature of the
present century is proud of many productions with which the
foregoing chapters have not dealt.<p>

Among the countries in which Thomism has found able reprentatives,
Hungary holds a prominent place.  As early as the
sixteenth century, Scholastic philosophy flourished in the seminaries
erected, according to the spirit of the Council of Trent,
by Nicholas Ol&aacute;h and Cardinal Peter Pazm&aacute;ny, S.J., archbishop
of Esztergom.  The control thus exercised by Scholastic principles
upon Hungarian thought became stronger still through
the liberation of Hungary from the Turkish rule.  And it thus
happened that, in the eighteenth century, while Scholastic philosophy
was rapidly losing ground in the rest of Europe, it was
regarded in Hungary as a necessary complement of a liberal
education.<p>

In the nineteenth century, however, the influence of the
French revolution and of German rationalism produced a notable
change in the attitude of Hungarian thinkers.  As was to be
expected, this change was unfavorable to the traditional Christian
philosophy.  Scholasticism soon lost its former prestige and
was finally rejected from the gymnasia, even from the seminaries.<p>

Such was the state of things when the encyclical <i>AEterni
Patris</i>, like an electric spark, produced a sudden change in the
attitude of Hungarian Catholics.  Scholastic philosophy became
an essential element of ecclesiastical studies.  In this remarkable
movement the Central Seminary of Budapest and the Seminary
of Esztergom took the lead.  They were soon followed by
others, so that nowadays very few ecclesiastical institutions are
still lacking a chair of philosophy.<p>

Not long afterwards a Society of St. Thomas was founded in
Budapest (1893) and an important periodical publication, the
<i>B&ouml;lcseleti Foly&oacute;irat,</i> was created by John Kiss, professor of
philosophy in the Seminary of Temesvar (1886).  Since its
foundation, the <i>B&ouml;lcseleti Foly&oacute;irat</i> has served the cause of neo-
Thomism with zeal and success.  Among its most distinguished
contributors, let us mention J. Koz&aacute;ry, St. Szekely, 0. Proh&aacute;szka,
L. Szilvek and J. Ochaba (cf. Bibliography).<p>

Hungarian Catholics have not limited themselves to the articles
and discussions contained in the <i>B&ouml;lcseleti Foly&oacute;irat.</i>  They
have also enriched neo-Scholastic literature with many separate
works which, unhappily -- on account of the very language in
which they are written -- are not known outside of Hungary as
well as they deserve.  Most important among them is the work
entitled <i>Instinct and Intellect</i> (1898), written by St. Sz&eacute;kely,
which is probably one of the most important studies ever made
about animal instinct; and the two remarkable volumes of
Bishop Ottokarus Proh&aacute;szka.  The first of these, <i>God and the
World</i> (1891), deals with the arguments for the existence of a
Supreme Being, whereas the second, <i>Heaven and Earth</i> (1901),
is a cosmogony.<p>

Among the defenders of neo-Scholasticism in Hungary, the
best known is Gustave P&eacute;csi, professor in the Seminary of Esztergom.
This is due, in the first place, to the originality of
some of his theories, and also to the fact that his most important
works have been written in Latin.<p>

Gustave P&eacute;csi, born in 1874, studied in Rome from 1893 to
1900, and received the degrees of Doctor of Philosophy and
Theology.  Since 1902 he has taught philosophy in the Seminary
of Esztergom.<p>

His chief work is entitled <i>Cursus Brevis Philosophiae,</i> and
consists of three volumes.  The first, dealing with logic and
metaphysics, appeared in 1906; the second, dealing with cosmology
and psychology, appeared in 1907; the third, dealing
with natural theology and ethics, has not appeared yet.<p>

The importance of Mr. P&eacute;csi's philosophy is chiefly due to
his section on Cosmology, which marks a most significant phase
in the evolution of neo-Scholasticism.  Two doctrines of his
deserve a special mention:  his theory of Matter and Form and
his chapter on Energetics.<p>

To many sympathizers of neo-Scholasticism the endeavor to
revive the theory of Matter of Form had appeared a fruitless
attempt.  In view of the actual condition of phvsical science,
the defenders of hylemorphism left the impression of men who
would cover a dead body with a new garb.  For Aristotle, primordial
matter was an indeterminate abstraction, something
which was, and yet was not, <i>"materia neque quid, neque quantum,
neque quale, neque aliud quidquam est."</i><A HREF="perrierg.html#XIV1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a>  This mysterious
entity had been accepted by the great doctors of the thirteenth
century, and still lingered in all treatises of Scholastic philosophy.
Those men themselves who were defending Scholasticism
from a scientific point of view had not dared part with the
fetich.  Mr. Albert Farges had clung with all his might to the
old idol.  Mr. Nys had proved himself to be less reluctant to
concessions; he had not yet, however, been bold enough.  First
among neo-Scholastics, Mr. P&eacute;csi has formulated the theory of
Primordial Matter in a form which men of science may accept.<p>

He identifles Primordial Matter with the ultimate ground of
all material reality, the ether.<A HREF="perrierg.html#XIV2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a>  The <i>materia prima</i> thus ceases
to be an empty abstraction:  it becomes something concrete, a
reality whose existence is testified by natural science itself.<A HREF="perrierg.html#XIV3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a>  As
for the substantial form, Mr. P&eacute;csi identifies it with the interatomic
energy.<A HREF="perrierg.html#XIV4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a><p>

In the section of his Cosmology entitled <i>"Energetics,"</i> Mr.
P&eacute;csi calls in question the accepted axioms of physical science.
He refutes the principle of the conservation of energy, which
he regards as the foundation of materialism.  He also refutes
or corrects the law of entropy and the laws of Newton on inertia
and action and reaction.  To the traditional laws of motion
he opposes the following laws:<p>

1.  All physical bodies persevere in the state of rest unless
impelled by an external force.  But the body impelled by an
external force moves only proportionally to the impression received
from the external force and always in the direction of
the impression.<p>

2.  The intensity -- or velocity -- of the motion depends upon
the difference between the action and the reaction, <i>i. e.,</i> is in
direct mathematical proportion to the action, and in inverse
mathematical proportion to the reaction.<p>

3.  If the mutual relation of the action and the reaction in
subsequent moments is constant, motion will be uniform; if the
mutual relation of the action and the reaction is modified, the
motion will cease to be uniform and acceleration or retardation
will follow.<A HREF="perrierg.html#XIV5"><SUP>[5]</sup></a><p>

Mr. P&eacute;csi's theory on this point has not been unanimously
accepted by neo-Scholastics.  It has, been severely criticized by
Chr. Schreiber in the <i>Philosophisches Jahrbuch.</i>  Mr. P&eacute;csi,
however, has developed it anew in a separate treatise, written at
first in Hungarian and translated into Latin by the author himself,
under the title of <i>Crisis axiomatum modernae Phisicae.</i><p>

In Bohemia the Thomistic movement is represented by Vychodil,
who, in 1889, published a work dealing with the proofs of
God's existence; Eugene Kaderavek, the author of several works
inspired by the purest Scholastic principles and of important
articles published in the <i>Philosophisches Jahrbuch</i> and the
<i>Jahrbuch f&uuml;r Philosophie und speculative Theologie;</i> Havaty,
Pospisil, etc.<p>

In the Netherlands, a chair of Thomistic philosophy was
founded in 1894 at the University of Amsterdam and confided
to the Dominican Van de Groot.  A better choice could hardly
have been made.  Fr. Van de Groot is one of the most learned
and enthusiastic admirers of the philosophy of the Angelic Doctor.
In many remarkable works, written in Dutch or in Latin,
as well as in articles published in the <i>Divus Thomas</i> and the
<i>Revue Thomiste,</i> he has proved himself to be one of the most
worthy champions of the Scholastic cause.<p>

Let us mention also the Jesuit Vogels, who published in
Amsterdam, in 1900, a treatise on Free Will, the first contribution
to neo-Scholastic literature written in the Flemish
language.<p>
<p>

<b><a name="2">SECTION</a> 2. -- THE NEO-SCHOLASTIC REVIVAL IN ENGLAND</b><p>

In the general return of the Catholic philosophical world to
the principles of St. Thomas, England has not remained a laggard.
A few years after the promulgation of the encyclical
<i>AEterni Patris,</i> Thomas Harper, S.J., published his <i>Metaphysics
of the Schools,</i> still considered as one of the most important
works inspired by Scholastic principles during the nineteenth
century.<p>

Born in London in 1821, Thomas Harper abjured Methodism
and entered the Society of Jesus in 1852.  For several years he
taught philosophy at the famous college of Stonyhurst.  He
died in 1893.<p>

His <i>Metaphysics of the Schools</i> is an endeavor to present the
metaphysical principles of the schoolmen in a form accessible
to English readers.  By the thoroughness of the exposition and
its depth of thought the <i>Metaphysics of the Schools</i> must be
reckoned as one of the most valuable neo-Scholastic productions.
"In England, wrote Domet de Vorges in 1888, we find only
one neo-Scholastic writer worthy of mention.  But what an
author!  What a monument!  Like a pyramid bathed in the
dew of fifty centuries, it rears its massive form aloft in the
midst of a desert.  The Metaphysics of Fr. Harper is certainly
the greatest work thus far produced by the Thomistic movement.
It is also perhaps the most profound, a work that shows the
eminent dialectical faculties of its author in all their
brilliancy."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XIV6"><SUP>[6]</sup></a><p>

More recently, the English Jesuits have acquired a new title
to the gratitude of all lovers of Scholastic speculation by the
publication of the Stonyhurst Philosophical Series, which is the
most valuable exposition of Scholastic philosophy written in the
English language.<p>

The series, of which several editions have been made in a few
years, comprises the following works:  Logic, by Richard F.
Clarke, S.J.; First Principles of Knowledge, by John Rickaby,
S.J.; Moral Philosophy, by Joseph Rickaby, S.J.; Natural Theology,
by Bernard Boedder, S.J.; Psychology, by Michael Maher,
S.J.; General Metaphysics, by John Rickaby, S.J.; Political
Economy, by C. S. Devas.<p>

Particularly worthy of attention are Maher's <i>Psychology</i> and
Boedder's <i>Natural Theology.</i><p>

Fr. Maher's <i>Psychology</i> exposes, in a clear and attractive
style, the Scholastic theory of the soul.  The essential difference
between sense and intellect, the spirituality of the soul, the
freedom of the will, are demonstrated according to the best
Scholastic arguments.  The work also contains a lucid exposition
and valuable criticisms of the philosophical systems of
Kant, Locke, Hume, Mill, Bain, Spencer and other British
associationists.  It studies the recent hypotheses about the relations
of body and soul and pronounces the double-aspect theory contradictory
to experience and to reason.<p>

Boedder's <i>Natural Theology,</i> in addition to the chapters dealing
with the existence and the attributes of God, in which the
Scholastic doctrine of the Divine Being is clearly and faithfully
expounded, contains a dissertation about the much-disputed
question of physical premotion.  After a fair exposition of both
views, Fr. Boedder declares himself in favor of Molinism and
gives serious reasons to show that the so-called Thomistic theory
does not really belong to St. Thomas.<p>

A few years after the publication of his Natural Theology,
Fr. Boedder enriched neo-Scholastic literature with two Latin
treatises dealing, the one with Natural Theology, the other with
Psychology.  These treatises form two volumes of a new course
of Scholastic philosophy, published in Friburg by the Stonyhurst
professors, and known as <i>Cursus Philosophicus</i> (cf.
Bibliography).<p>

Joseph Rickaby (born 1845), besides the volume on Moral
Philosophy of the Stonyhurst Series, has contributed several
important publications to English neo-Scholastic literature.  In
1906 he gave an annotated translation of the <i>Summa contra
Gentiles.</i>  In the same year he published the work, <i>Free Will
and Four English Philosophers (Hobbes, Locke, Hume and
Mill),</i> in which he defends the freedom of the will against the
determinist theories of these philosophers.  His method is to
quote a passage from the philosopher under examination and
then to discuss it.<p>

Richard F. Clarke, the author of the treatise on Logic, has
contributed several important articles to the <i>American Catholic
Quarterly.</i>  He has also published a dialogue on the existence
of God, which is one of the most charming philosophical dialogues
ever penned.<p>

Among the actual defenders of neo-Scholasticism in England,
the most prolific is probably Francis Aveling (born 1875).  In
quite a number of review artiiles and short treatises he has
proved himself a valiant champion of the Thomistic cause.  One
of his best productions is the volume entitled, <i>The God of
Philosophy.</i>  In this charming treatise the learned writer educes
the natural proofs for the, existence of God.  His style is simple,
clear and concise.  The philosophical arguments are shorn
of their rigidity and presented in a most fascinating aspect.<p>
