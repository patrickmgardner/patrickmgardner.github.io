The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter II: Scholastic Logic</h1><hr><p>

Whereas all other sciences needed long periods of time to
acquire the definite, systematic form they now possess, nay, in
many cases, to find their right path, logic has hit at once its
legitimate procedure, and has been able to reach without delay
its complete development.  If it has not advanced a single step
since Aristotle's time, if our modern university text-books do
not give us any more nor less than the doctrine of the Stagirite,
it is because logic had become in his hands a complete system,
had grasped and accomplished its purpose.  The reason of this
advantage is obvious.  Unlike all other sciences, logic has to
deal with the form, not with the content, of thought.  It does
not examine the immediate assumptions from which we start;
it is not concerned with the conclusions we derive from them;
it deals only with the manner in which they are derived.  It is
merely the art or the science of reasoning.<p>

Now, all men are endowed with similar faculties and reason
in a similar way.  The causes of the divergences of speculative
conclusions, of the incompatibility of contradictory systems, are
not to be found in the methods according to which these systems
are built, but in the fundamental principles which lie at their
basis.<p>

In modern times, however, the Aristotelian logic has been
criticized.  Eminent authors have condemned its course
of action, declaring its direction unnatural, its methods barren.
It has been contended that upon the ruins of the effete Mediaeval
dialectic a new science of logic had to be built.  Induction has
been produced and acclaimed as the sovereign guide of human
speculation, while deductive methods have been regarded as
useless and relegated to the background.<p>

This view, due in great part to the progress of Physical
science, has found an able representative and defender in John
Stuart Mill.  The great significance of his <i>System of Logic</i> lies
in the endeavor to reverse the process which considered the
syllogistic logic as fundamental, and to subordinate the syllogism
to the induction.  This superiority assigned to the induction is
a natural consequence of the nominalistic principles.  If we
start from the assumption that the individual is the only reality,
and that the universal is a mere meaningless name, the syllogism
loses its force and becomes a mere tautology.<p>

The syllogism, in its most perfect form, starts from a universal,
subsumes a particular under that universal, and reaches
the conclusion that the attribute which belongs to the universal
belongs to the particular also.  Now, as the universal does not
possess any validity for the nominalists, they must regard the
major premise as containing the conclusion not only formally,
but materially, and hence the syllogism as devoid of all logical
value.<p>

In the example:
Man is mortal,
Socrates is a man,
therefore, Socrates is mortal,
the major premise:  Man is Mortal, is not, from a nominalistic
point of view, a universal proposition.  The term man is only
a shorthand register of individual cases.  It means John, Peter,
Thomas, etc., and the proposition:  Man is mortal, may be resolved
into particular propositions, and formulated as:
John, Peter, Thomas, etc., are mortal.<p>

Now, the subject Socrates of our conclusion either is or is
not contained in the universal term man.  If it is, then our
reasoning is tautological, is even guilty of the fallacy called
<i>petitio principii,</i> inasmuch as it implicitly assumes the conclusion
it pretends to prove.  If, on the other hand, the term
Socrates is not contained in the term man, it is by a process of
induction that we extend the meaning of the term man, which
included John, Peter and Thomas, to Socrates; and the induction
becomes the foundation of all truthful investigation, the
basal stone of the syllogism itself.<p>

That this depreciation of all syllogistic argumentation is
openly professed by Mill, is well known to all who have read
his <i>System of Logic:</i><p>

"It must be granted," says he, "that in every syllogism, considered
as an argument to prove the conclusion, there is a petitio
principii.  When we say,<p>

All men are mortal
Socrates is a man
therefore
Socrates is mortal;<p>

it is unanswerably urged by the adversaries of the syllogistic
theory, that the proposition, Socrates is mortal, is presupposed
in the more general assumption, All men are mortal:  that we
cannot be assured of the mortality of all men, unless we were
previously certain of the mortality of every individual man;
that if it be still doubtful whether Socrates, or any other individual
you choose to name, be mortal or not, the same degree
of uncertainty must hang over the assertion, All men are mortal:
that the general principle, instead of being given as evidence
of the particular case, cannot itself be taken for true without
exception, until every shadow of doubt which could affect
any case comprised with it, is dispelled by evidence aliunde;
and then what remains for the syllogism to prove? that, in short,
no reasoning from generals to particulars can, as such, prove
anything; since from a general principle you cannot infer any
particulars, but those which the principle itself assumes as
foreknown.<A HREF="perrierg.html#II1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a><p>

This view, perfectly conclusive for the adherents of nominalism,
loses its value if, with the great Scholastic masters, we
admit the validity of the universal; if we regard the word man
as meaning, not simply John, Peter and Thomas, but a universal
essence common to all possible men.  The error of the nominalists
lies in the confusing the denotation of a term with its
conotation; and, if Mill tries to clear himself from such an
accusation, it is on account of an inconsistency which runs
through the whole of his <i>System of Logic,</i> and appears as a continual
puzzle to the uninitiated reader.<p>

The conclusion of a syllogism is contained formally in the
major premise, but not materially.  As the universal term man
denotes the essence common to all human beings, it also denotes
the essence of the individual Socrates; and, if mortality is one
of the characteristics of the human essence, it will undoubtedly
be a characteristic of Socrates.  The conclusion, Socrates is
mortal, is, however, contained in the major premise implicitly
only.  We may be convinced of the truth of the assertion:  Man
is mortal, because we know that human nature as such involves
the element of mortality (the human body being an organism,
and all organic beings being subject to growth, decay, and dissolution);
and not have realized that the individual Socrates is
mortal also.  The logical value of the syllogistic reasoning consists
then in making explicitly known what was known implicitly
in enlarging indefinitely the field of our <i>a priori</i> knowledge.
Under its dominion lie all <i>a priori</i> sciences, pure mathematics
as well as philosophy.<p>

The inductive process was not unknown to the Mediaeval philosophers.
Without mentioning Roger Bacon, who not only insists
sisted upon the use of observation and experience, but condemned
all deductive reasoning, we find well conducted examples of
induction in Thomas Aquinas, Duns Scotus and Albert the
Great.  A remarkable passage of the work <i>De motibus animalium,</i><A HREF="perrierg.html#II2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a>
in which Albert the Great maintains the thesis that the
origin of all motions of animals is on the back of the head,
might have been written after Mill's <i>System of Logic</i> without
any essential change.<A HREF="perrierg.html#II3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a><p>

These examples of induction in the modern sense were, however
exceptional.  Their authors themselves considered them
as of little importance:  "The science of nature, said Albert the
Great, must not simply gather facts, it must look for the causes
of the natural phenomena."<A HREF="perrierg.html#II4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a><p>

This undervaluation of inductive reasoning was due to the
fact that the particular sciences had not yet acquired a field of
their own, and were regarded as forming part of philosophy.
Positive sciences, concerned with facts and laws, were as yet
unknown.<p>

The case being very different nowadays, neo-Scholastic logic
is not satisfied with a repetition of the logical doctrines of the
Middle Ages.  In harmony with Leo XIII's formula:  <i>Vetera
novis augere,</i> it makes a thorough study of the inductive process.<p>

Deductive reasoning, however, does not thereby disappear.
It possesses a field of its own, in which induction has nothing
to do.  Enjoying an undisputed sovereignty in the science of
nature, induction is absolutely powerless in the field of the
<i>a priori</i> sciences, such as mathematics; in the field of all those
which our mind in a certain sense creates.<p>
