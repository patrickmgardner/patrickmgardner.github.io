The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter VI: Scholastic Natural Theology</h1><hr><p>

<b><a name="1">SECTION</a> 1. -- NATURAL AND REVEALED THEOLOGY</b><p>

The very title, Natural Theology, suggests that some other
kind of theology exists.  And, indeed, Scholastics have always
carefully distinguished between natural and revealed theology.
This is one of the points which unmistakably separate the
Scholastic system from the philosophy of the Hegelian school.
According to Hegel and his disciples, no truth lies beyond the
reach of the human mind.  God is an object of experience as
clearly present to our natural faculties as tables and chairs.  An
adequate knowledge of the Absolute is thus perfectly possible,
and theology becomes a branch of philosophy.<p>

St. Thomas and the Scholastics, on the other hand, believe
that the Divine Essence cannot be known by our finite minds.
Our natural faculties may lead us to the knowledge of God's
existence; they may even enable us to reach a true knowledge
of his nature; but, as this knowledge is not reached by direct
intuition, but by the consideration of the finite world in which
we live, it cannot be adequate.<p>

As the imperfect knowledge of God our mind can attain may
be supplemented by the Divine Revelation, the science of theology
is evidently twofold:  Natural Theology deals with the
knowledge of God human reason can attain by its natural forces;
Revealed Theology deals with the knowledge of God which lies
beyond the reach of our natural faculties and is attainable only
by revelation.  The philosopher is thus concerned with natural
theology; be has nothing to do with revealed theology.<p>

<b><a name="2">SECTION</a> 2. -- PROOFS OF GOD'S EXISTENCE</b><p>

All possible proofs of the existence of the Divine Mind may
be classified under three heads:<p>

1.  The <i>a priori</i> proof, derived from the very concept of God,
and usually known as ontological argument.<p>

2.  The a posteriori proofs, by which we ascend from the
knowledge of the finite world to the knowledge of the infinite.<p>

3.  The moral arguments, drawn from the nature and aspirations
of the human heart; also, from the common consent of
mankind.<p>

The ontological argument has never enjoyed much favor
among Scholastic philosophers.  First proposed by Anselm of
Canterbury and at once assailed by Gaunilo the monk, it has
been discussed and finally rejected by Thomas Aquinas.  Accepted
in a slightly modified form by Descartes and Leibniz, it
has been rejected again by Kant and readmitted by Hegel, who
believed that since its first formulation until the time of Kant
it had been unanimously accepted among philosophers.<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a><p>

These repeated attempts to rehabilitate the fallen argument
have been a decided failure.  Neo-Scholastics to-day regard the
ontological proof as worthless, and, in so doing, are perfectly
justified.  The weak point of the argument has been clearly
pointed out by Thomas Aquinas.<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a>  Anselm's reasoning unduly
passes from the ideal to the real order.  The conception of the
most perfect being must include the element of existence, as
Anselm believed; but this existence must be ideal, limited to the
concept of our mind, and cannot legitimately be predicated of
the objective world.<p>

The argument from the moral law has been repeatedly formulated
and defended.  All men, it has been said, believe in the
existence of a moral law.  They all regard some actions as
praiseworthy, others as condemnable.  Now, without God, a
moral law would be an absurdity, because the very notion of a
law implies the existence of a legislator, endowed with a sufficient
authority to impose it and give it a sanction.<p>

Is this line of reasoning defensible?  We are not inclined to
believe it.  The fact that some acts are universally praised as
good, while others are universally condemned, may be sufficiently
explained from the nature of the acts themselves without any
necessity of a recourse to a supreme Lawgiver.  There is no
doubt that if God exists, he is the foundation and the source
of all truth, and therefore the ultimate ground of the moral
law; but, as his existence is precisely in question, it is from the
human acts themselves that we must start.  As no mathematician
needs to postulate a Divine Being in order to understand
that the sum of the angles of a triangle has been universally
believed to be equal to two right angles, so the moralist needs
no God to account for the fact that incontinence is universally
regarded as degrading and courage as praiseworthy. The very
results of our acts give us the clue as to their moral character.
Scholastic philosophers are thus right when they refuse to assign
to the argument from the moral law a primary importance,.<p>

Another moral argument, altogether different from the one
we have presently considered, is derived from the common consent
of mankind.  Like all moral arguments, the argument
from universal consent is regarded by Scholastics as of secondary
importance.  It is, however, defended as legitimate, and
invariably finds a place in treatises on natural theology.  The
fact itself that all peoples have believed in a Supreme Being
seems to admit of no reasonable doubt.  To Spencer's objection
that the savage's concepts of God have been evolved out of ghosts
or ancestor-spirits, and, with the evolution of human ideas, have
gradually acquired a nobler form, Scholastics answer that the
conceptions of God found among savage or semi-civilized nations
are corruptions of a purer and older form, and that the
tendency of mankind is thus to fall away from a primitive
monotheism.<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a>  Whether this theory can be maintained nowadays,
I will not here discuss.  I will limit myself to remarking
that it is far from rendering the argument from universal consent
sent unassailable.  This argument even becomes valueless if we
take into account the fact, attested by the Biblical relation and
generally admitted to-day by natural science, that all men have
come from a single stem.  The force of the argument lies in
the fact that a notion of the Deity is found among all tribes of
men, and must thus be due to human nature itself, inasmuch
as an error or a fraud might have crept among one particular
nation, but could not possess a universal character.  Now if all
men had a common origin, if there was at the beginning a single
family, it may be perfectly well supposed that an erroneous
notion has been accepted by this family, and, transmitted to its
posterity, has become a universal error of the human race.<p>

The arguments we have described as <i>a posteriori</i> are especially
insisted upon by St. Thomas and his modern followers.  These
arguments invariably start from the knowledge of the world
given in experience, and rise to the knowledge of God.  They
assume different forms, which may be reduced to the two we
shall presently expose.<p>

The first is sometimes described as "physical argument."  It
starts from the order of the world, the perfect adaptation of
means to ends which we find around us, and concludes that such
an adaptation evidently points to the existence of a supreme
Designer.  Absolutely speaking, a casual shock of atoms might
indeed have produced the world such as it is, just as printing
characters, thrown at random, might give the play of Hamlet,
but the chance for such a production is so insignificant that it
may be neglected.<p>

This argument has received a severe blow from Darwin's
theory of natural selection.  It is even contended that it has
been absolutely killed.  It is morally impossible that the paw
of the cat, so perfectly adapted to the catching of the prey,
should have been produced by a casual shock of atoms, just as
it is morally impossible that printing types, thrown at random,
should give the play of Hamlet.  But, if we adopt the theory
of natural selection; if we admit that the types which happen
to fall in the definite place they have in the play shall persist
in existence while the others shall disappear, the play of Hamlet
will fatally be produced.<p>

We should be cautious, however, not to assert too hastily that
the argument from design has been absolutely killed.  The
hypothesis of natural selection explains the order of the world
without taking a supreme Designer into account.  But what of
natural selection itself?  How are we to explain the tendency
of the atoms towards definite arrangements, the fact that some
arrangements persist in existence while others are destroyed?
Instead of the innate tendency of the atoms towards definite
groups, why was there not a tendency towards a perpetual chaos?
A chaotic cosmos seems indeed the only possible outcome of a
mere shock of atoms, and the hypothesis of natural selection is
a nonsense if we do not admit finality.  All the perfections of
the future world must thus be supposed to exist potentially in
the originary chaos, and the necessity of a designer by no means
disappears.<p>

The metaphysical argument is based upon the principle of
causality.  The fact that no beginning of existence can happen
without a cause has been proved in our chapter on metaphysics
and needs not be insisted upon.  In the metaphysical argument,
the form of the principle of causality is somewhat modified.
"Whatever does not exist of absolute necessity, it is contended,
cannot exist without a proportionate cause.<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a>  Which means
that the cause, considered in its totality, must contain a perfection
at least equal to that of the effect.  The validity of this
form of the principle of causality might perhaps be questioned.
It is strongly defended by neo-Scholasties, who contend that if
the cause failed to be proportionate, the excess of the effect
would really be without cause, and the general law of causality
would be thereby violated.<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI5"><SUP>[5]</sup></a><p>

The necessity of a proportionate cause being admitted, the
existence of a Supreme Mind follows as a necessary consequence.
A clear idea of the Scholastic line of reasoning may be gathered
from the following three propositions in which the argument
may be summed up:<p>

1.  <i>There are changes in our world, and these changes presuppose
a cause.</i>  The truth of this first proposition has been
clearly shown in our chapter on metaphysics.<p>

2.  <i>These changes presuppose a self-existing cause.</i>  If the
cause of the changes is not self-existing, it must be caused by
something else.  This something else, if not self-existing, must
also be caused, and we must finally arrive at a self-existing
being; otherwise we would have an infinite process, and no
change would be possible, inasmuch as a sufficient cause of the
change could never be found.  Thus far there is nothing in our
argument which a materialist would fail to admit.  A self-existing
being exists, he would say, but we need not go beyond
the molecule, the atom, the material world.  The following
proposition separates the Scholastic system from all materialistic
hypotheses:<p>

3.  <i>This self-existing being must be an immaterial and free
being.</i>  The ultimate cause of the world must not simply be a
cause; it must be a proportionate cause.  The world contains
immaterial and free beings, such as the human soul.  Therefore
the cause of the world must be an immaterial and free being,
that is to say, a personal God.<p>

<b><a name="3">SECTION</a> 3. -- ATTRIBUTES OF GOD</b><p>

The Divine Being of the Scholastics possesses three fundamental
attributes:  he is infinite, one and simple.<p>

The doctrine of an infinite God is not without difficulty.
Some Catholic philosophers have thought that, although faith
obliges us to believe in the infinity of the Supreme Being, this
infinity cannot strictly be proved by reason alone.  In a recent
article of the <i>Revue de Philosophie</i> (1906), Mr. Dessoulavy
expressed his sympathy for Schiller's thesis on this subject.
The modern followers of St. Thomas, however, strongly insist
upon the capacity of philosophy to reach a knowledge of the
infinity of God.  They adopt the line of reasoning which led
Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas to the concept of pure actuality
(<i>actus purus</i>).<p>

Every finite being, they argue, consists of actuality and potency:
of actuality in so far as it possesses some perfections;
of potency, in so far as it is capable of acquiring the perfections
it does not possess.  Now the actual is logically anterior to the
potential, because a potential being cannot become actual unless
it be acted upon by an actual being.  The ultimate cause of
reality must not therefore contain any potentiality; otherwise it
would presuppose another cause and would not be ultimate.  It
must be pure actuality, and accordingly possess all perfections
in an infinite degree.<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI6"><SUP>[6]</sup></a><p>

From the infinity of God follows his unity as a logical consequence.
If there were several Gods, they should differ in some
characteristics.  Each of them would thus lack the peculiar
perfections which characterize the others, and none could be
infinite.<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI7"><SUP>[7]</sup></a><p>

The proof of God's simplicity rests upon his self-existence.
Whatever is compound depends upon its constituent elements
and upon the cause of their union.  As God is the ultimate
ground of all reality, he cannot depend upon anything else and
must be absolutely simple.<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI8"><SUP>[8]</sup></a><p>

From these three fundamental attributes, all attributes of the
Divine Being are derived.  They are not all, however, establlished
in the same way.  As our intuitive knowledge is limited
to finite beings, it is from these finite beings that we must rise
to a conception of the infinite.  Now the attributes of creatures
are of several orders:  some involve imperfection, others do not.
The attributes which involve imperfection, such as extension, reason,
etc., cannot be predicated of God who is infinitely perfect.
Those which involve no imperfection, such as intelligence, power,
etc., are properly in God.  But whereas finite beings possess
these attributes in a limited degree, God, in virtue of his infinity,
possesses them as boundless and infinite.<p>

The attributes of the Supreme Being may be therefore classified
into negative and positive.<p>

The negative attributes are immutability, eternity and immensity.
They do not give us any real knowledge of God.
They simply remove from the conception of the Infinite some
imperfections attached to finite things.  They do not show us
what God is, but what he is not.<p>

God's immutability is closely connected with his infinity.
Whatever admits of change is not infinitely perfect.  It lacks
at some moment of its existence the perfections it subsequently
acquires.  It possesses some potentiality and is not, like the
Divine Being, absolutely actual.<p>

God's eternity can be proved in a similar way.  When the
Scholastics assert that God is eternal, they do not, as is sometimes
supposed, simply mean that he had no beginning and shall
know no end; they also remove from his conception the element
of succession.  They mean that there exists for him no past and
no future; that his being is a perennial present.<p>

We have already touched upon the question of God's immensity
in our chapter on Psychology.  We have shown that, in
St. Thomas's view, the assertion that "God is everywhere" does
not mean that he is present in all parts of space as bodies are.
It means that he acts upon all things; that he is present in
them by a contact of virtue, not by a contact of quantity.<p>

The positive attributes of the Divine Being are his knowledge,
his will, and his omnipotence.<p>

God has a comprehensive knowledge of his essence, and in his
own essence he sees the essences of all real and possible things.
His knowledge extends to the contingent as well as to the necessary;
and, inasmuch as he is eternal, to the future as well as
to the past.<p>

The faculty of will consisting in the love of the object presented
by the intellect as good, involves no imperfection and
must be found in the Supreme Being.  God loves his own essence
necessarily, because his essence is the supreme and infinite
good, and is therefore worthy of an infinite love.  His love for
creatures is an outcome of the love he bears to himself.  It is
in his own essence that he knows all finite beings, of which his
essence is the prototype.  It is in his own essence that he loves
all finite beings, the perfections and the goodness of which are
found in his essence in an infinite degree.<p>

God is also omnipotent.  He can do by a single act of will
whatever is not intrinsically impossible.  As for things whose
concept involves a contradiction -- such as a square circle, or a
man being an ass -- it is only an improper use of the terms that
leads us to assert that God cannot do them: it would be more
correct to say that the things themselves cannot be done.  They
involve a contradiction, and the Infinite Being must above all
be self-consistent.  It is the same self-consistency that explains
how God cannot possibly commit sinful acts.  The essence of
sin consisting, not precisely in the production of an effect, but
in the opposition of our free will to the eternal law of God, its
presence in the Divine Being would involve the denial of his
own self.<p>

The preceding classification of the attributes of God should
not, however, lead us to believe that the Divine Essence is considered
by Thomists as divided into separate and unconnected
compartments.  Hegel's reproach against the old Metaphysics,
of cutting off from their connection the terms of thought,<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI9"><SUP>[9]</sup></a> is
absolutely unjust if directed against Scholastic speculation.
St. Thomas and his followers insist upon the physical and metaphysical
simplicity of the Divine Being.  We assign attributes
to God, it is true; but we must not forget that these attributes,
although different for us, are essentially one in God.  God is
his essence, or his nature;<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI10"><SUP>[10]</sup></a> his essence is his own being;<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI11"><SUP>[11]</sup></a> his
intellect his own being;<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI12"><SUP>[12]</sup></a> his will is also his own being.<A HREF="perrierg.html#VI13"><SUP>[13]</sup></a>  If
we are compelled to study his attributes separately, it is on
account of the imperfection of our mind, which, being essentially
finite, cannot grasp the Infinite: <i>"Balbutiendo, ut possumus,
excelsa Dei resonamus."</i><A HREF="perrierg.html#VI14"><SUP>[14]</sup></a><p>
