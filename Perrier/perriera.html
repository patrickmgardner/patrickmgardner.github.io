The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter X: The Neo-Scholastic Revival in Spain, Portugal, and Spanish
America</h1>

<b><a name="1">SECTION</a> 1. -- THE NEO-SCHOLASTIC REVIVAL IN SPAIN</b><p>

Our ordinary philosophical studies in American institutions
may easily lead us to the belief that there is no such a thing as
a Spanish philosophy.  Who, among our university students,
has ever heard of a Spanish philosopher?  Who could presently
name one?  Our complete ignorance on this point must perhaps
be excused.  Some years ago, Mr. Guardia wrote an article in
the <i>Revue Philosophique</i> to prove that we are right.  He gave
it the attractive title of <i>La mis&egrave;re philosophique en Espagne,</i>
and strongly defended the thesis that Spain possesses no philosophy.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a>
The same thesis had been defended a few years before
by the Mexican priest Agustin Rivera, who had extended his
condemnation to the Spanish-speaking countries of the New
World.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a>  Few Spaniards, however, would agree with these two
men.  Patriotism is strong beyond the Pyrenees, and the assertions
tions to which it frequently leads the fiery sons of Pelayo would
sound incredible to the cool-headed Anglo-Saxon race.  It
seems that the distinguished writer Marcelino Menendez y
Pelayo has placed Spanish philosophy on equal footing with the
philosophical systems of France and Italy, and has judged it
inferior only to Greek and German speculation.  To most of
us, this judgment would seem rather bold.  It has been condemned
as too timid by William Garcia, who does not hesitate
to give Spanish philosophy the first place.  His line of reasoning
is very simple.  He summarily dismisses German philosophy
as a mere play of imagination and no knowledge of truth.  As
regards Greek philosophy, Garcia, as a genuine Scholastic, does
full justice to Aristotle; but, he adds, Aristotle has been surpassed
by St. Thomas, so that the Thomistic, or Italian philosophy,
is really the first philosophy.  Now, the Thomistic philosophy
has become Spanish by right of conquest.  Hence, it is clear
that Spanish philosophy is the first philosophy.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a><p>

Our belief as to the real worth of Spanish thought may be
greatly influenced by the point of view from which we study the
question.  A Kantian, for example, can hardly be proud of the
influence the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> has exercised on the
Spanish soil.  If, as Mr. Latinus points out, only two Spaniards,
during the nineteenth century, have judged it useful to go and
study philosophy in Germany, if the physician Nieto Serrano is
actually the only Kantian in Spain,<A HREF="perrierg.html#X4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a> all who maintain that
philosophy must flow from Koenigsberg, that we must go back
to Kant, will be apt to be as severe to Spanish thought as Rivera
and Guardia have been.<p>

A neo-Scholastic will no doubt be more indulgent.  Spain is
perhaps the only country in which the Scholastic traditions
have never been entirely forgotten.  A long time before Sanseverino
published his <i>Philosophia Christiana</i> and Leo XIII his
encyclical, distinguished Spaniards had defended the essential
principles of the Aristotelian and Thomistic philosophy.  During
the course of the nineteenth century, Spain, as we shall see,
has produced three great philosophers who are certainly among
the greatest of whom the Scholastic revival may boast.  One of
them, Urraburu, is still living; the other two, Balmes and Gonzalez,
have departed from this world many years ago, but their
works are immortal.<p>

At the end of the eighteenth century, the sensism of Locke
and Condillac was introduced into Spain and gained many disciples.
Among its best known adherents may be mentioned the
Jesuits Eximeno and Andres.  Scholasticism, however, did not
disappear altogether.  It was defended by Rafael Puigcerver,
O.P., in his <i>Philosophia Sancti Thomae Aquinatis, auribus hujus
temporis accommodata,</i> which was used as a text-book in many
institutions.<p>

Not long afterwards, Francisco Alvarado, O.P. (1756-1814),
generally known as "el fil&oacute;sofo rancio" (the rank philosopher),
acquired a great celebrity by his <i>Cartas Aristol&eacute;licas</i> and his
<i>Cartas Criticas</i>, in which he defended the philosophy of St.
Thomas against the heterodox, political, social and philosophical
theories which had been recently introduced into Spain.<p>

But the man who gave to Spanish philosophy its greatest
splendor during the first half of the nineteenth century was
undoubtedly Balmes.<p>

James Balmes was born in Vich (Catalonia) in 1810 and died
in 1848.  Completely unknown in 1840, he acquired in a few
years an immense reputation.  He alone succeeded in awakening
the interest of Europe in Spanish thought.  Besides numerous
social productions, among which must be mentioned a comparative
study of Protestantism and Catholicism with regard to
their influence upon European civilization, Balmes has written
the following philosophical works:  <i>El Criterio</i>, or a study of
the criteria of truth, which, in Mr. Turner's opinion, is his most
valuable contribution to philosophy; <i>Cartas &aacute; un esc&eacute;ptico</i>, a
collection of letters in which scepticism is most ably discussed;
<i>Filosof며 elemental;</i> and <i>Filosof며 fundamental,</i> the work
upon which his fame as a philosopher chiefly rests.<p>

Orestes A. Brownson declares the Fundamental Philosophy
to be not only Balmes's masterpiece, but the most important
work published on the bases of philosophy during the nineteenth
century.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X5"><SUP>[5]</sup></a>  This judgment is too eulogistic perhaps; but we
must at least admit that Balmes's work has acquired the character
of a philosophical classic, and will be studied as long as
philosophy endures upon the face of the earth.<p>

When Balmes wrote his works, there were as yet no signs of
a return to Thomism.  His philosophy, accordingly, is not
directly connected with the neo-Scholastic revival.  It is, however,
Thomistic in its essential character and in most of its
details.  Thomas Aquinas was the favorite author of the Spanish
thinker, who regarded the <i>Summa Theologica</i> as the fountain
of all truth.  Balmes's thought has also been influenced,
although in a less degree, by Descartes and the Scottish school.
Greatly sympathetic to Reid, Balmes professes the same aversion
to Idealism, and, speaking of Berkeley, exclaims:  "Insanity is
insanity still, however sublime it may be."<A HREF="perrierg.html#X6"><SUP>[6]</sup></a><p>

Unlike the early Roman Thomists, Balmes possesses a remarkable
knowledge of modern philosophy.  He knows thoroughly
Descartes, Locke, Condillac, Hume, Lamennais, and his
criticisms of Kant may be read with profit even to-day by all
students of German philosophy.  One of the ideals which
Balmes cherished, and which a premature death did not allow
him to realize, was a thorough study and a refutation of German
idealism.  Strange to say, Balmes is, however, less far from
Kant than he supposes.<p>

Kant teaches the subjectivity of space. Balmes says:<p>

"The idea of extension is a primitive fact of our mind.  It
is not produced by sensations, but precedes them, if not in time,
at least in the order of being."<A HREF="perrierg.html#X7"><SUP>[7]</sup></a><p>

Kant teaches that our knowledge of the external world is
nothing but a knowledge of phenomena, and that the thing-in-
itself is unknowable.  Balmes says:<p>

"A pure spirit -- the existence of which we must always suppose;
for, though all finite beings were annihilated, there would
still remain the infinite being which is God -- a pure spirit would
know the extended world just as it is in itself, and would not
have the sensible representations either external or internal
which we have."<A HREF="perrierg.html#X8"><SUP>[8]</sup></a><p>

Kant teaches that, even with regard to our own self, our
knowledge is phenomenal.  Balmes says:<p>

"The Ego does not see itself intuitively; it is offered to itself
only mediately, by its acts; that is, so far as it is known, it
is in the same category as all other external beings, which are
all known by their effect upon us."<A HREF="perrierg.html#X9"><SUP>[9]</sup></a><p>

A comparative study of the philosophies of Balmes and Kant
would be of great interest.  The scope of this treatise obliges
us to limit ourselves to a suggestion and a few remarks.  Whatever
the conclusions of such a study might be, one thing is
beyond doubt:  Balmes's principles show a marked tendency to
subjectivism.  He professes that we possess certainty only with
regard to internal phenomena, and that we know external objects
by means of a natural instinct.<p>

Ramon Marti de Eixala (died 1857), although lacking the
depth of genius of Balmes, exercised a more direct influence
upon Spanish thinking.  Surrounded by a number of disciples,
he gave birth to the school known as "Catalonian school."  One
of his disciples, Llorens, eagerly entered into the spirit of the
Thomistic revival which was then taking place in Italy, and,
during the last years of his life, strove to put his doctrine in
perfect harmony with those of Sanseverino and Cornoldi.<p>

Not long afterwards, the same province of Catalonia, proud
of such thinkers as Marti and Balmes, produced another philosopher
of real merit, Antonio Comellas.<p>

Antonio Comellas y Cluet (1832-1884) has not enjoyed during
his life the noisy celebrity in which other men delight.
Even after his death, he has remained unknown for many years,
and his name would probably be forgotten to-day were it not
for the learned study made by the distinguished historian of
philosophy, Gomez lzquierdo, in the review <i>La Cultura Espa&ntilde;ola</i>
(cf. Bibliography).  Comellas's life, as Gomez lzquierdo
points out, may be summed up in these two words:  Solitude
and study.<p>

His greatest contribution to philosophy are his <i>Demonstraci&oacute;n
de la armon며 entre la religi&oacute;n cat&oacute;lica y la ciencia</i> and his
<i>Introducci&oacute;n &aacute; la Filosof며.</i><p>

The man who has raised Spanish philosophy to its greatest
height during the second half of the nineteenth century is
Cardinal Gonzalez.<p>

Zeferino Gonzalez y D며z-Tufion (1831-1892), born in Villoria,
entered the Dominican order at the age of thirteen and
was sent, when quite a young man, to the mission of the Philippines.
In Manila, he taught philosophy and theology and published
his first work:  <i>Estudios sobre la Filosofia de Santo Tomas,</i>
which evinces a deep knowledge of the philosophy of the Angelic
Doctor, and is regarded by many critics as the most remarkable
work on the subject written during the nineteenth century.<p>

Compelled by his health to return to Spain in 1865, Gonzalez
contributed to <i>La Ciudad de Dios</i> and other periodicals numerous
philosophical essays.  His <i>Philosophia elementaria,</i> his
<i>Estudios religiosos, filos&oacute;ficos, cient멵icos y sociales,</i> his most
recent work, <i>La Biblia y la Ciencia</i> (1891), and especially his
<i>Historia de la Filosofia,</i> in which a whole volume is devoted to
Mediaeval philosophy, have given the last touch to his reputation
as a philosopher and assured him a place among the greatest
thinkers of his country and the most genuine defenders and
propagators of neo-Scholasticism.<p>

Cotemporaneous with Gonzalez are Orti y Lara and Pidal y
Mon.<p>

Juan Manuel Orti y Lara has written immensely.  His most
important philosophical works may be seen in our bibliography.
Besides his <i>Psicolog며,</i> his <i>L&oacute;gica,</i> his <i>&Eacute;tica</i> and
other other constructive works, he deserves the gratitude of neo-
Scholastics for his refutation of the pantheistic philosophy of Krause
and of the work of Draper.  His conception of the Thomistic movement
is, however, very narrow.  Orti y Lara does not take any interest
in modern philosophy, which he regards as "resting upon
error and sin."<A HREF="perrierg.html#X10"><SUP>[10]</sup></a><p>

Alejandro Pidal y Mon, bom in Madrid in 1847, is chiefly
known as a political writer.  His principal contributions to
philosophy are a work entitled <i>Sistemas filos&oacute;ficos</i> (1873), and
a study on St. Thomas, <i>Santo Tom&aacute;s de Aquino</i> (1875), which
has been greatly praised by Cardinal Gonzalez.<p>

Among the, most recent Spanish neo-Scholastics, let us mention:
Arnaiz, Cepeda, Daurella, Donadiu, Gonzalez y Arintero,
Lemos, Hern&aacute;ndez y Fajarn&eacute;s, Miralles y Sbert, the Jesuits
Urr&aacute;buru and Mendive, the historian of philosophy G&oacute;mez
lzquierdo.<p>

J. Mendive, S.J. (died 1906), is the author of a course of philosophy,
written at first in Spanish, and afterwards published
in Latin (1886).  Like many other Jesuits, he has been
reproached with following Suarez too closely in his interpretations
of St. Thomas.<p>

Antonio Hernandez y Fajarn&eacute;s, professor in the University
of Zaragoza, is the author of a series of philosophical and scientific
works in which the fundamental principles of Scholasticism
are defended and opposed to the antagonistic modern theories.
His first work, <i>Psicolog며 celular</i> (1884), is an able refutation
of Haeckel's biological theories.  His <i>Ontolog며</i> (1887) is
directed against positivism.<p>

Juan Gonzalez de Arintero, O.P., published in 1904 a work
entitled <i>La Providencia y la Evoluci&oacute;n,</i> whose chief aim is the
proof of the existence of finality in the universe.  Fr. Arintero
attacks the doctrine of pure chance; and, in his chapter on evolution,
clearly shows that evolution without finality is contrary
to reason, to experience, to science itself.<p>

No less profound is the scientific knowledge of Placido Angel
Lemos.  In his work, <i>La Vida Org&aacute;nica,</i> published in 1902, he
defends the validity of the concept of substance, proves against
Haeckel the unity of the living being, studies the origin of life
upon the earth, and strives to show that a perfect harmony exists
between scientific discoveries and the teachings of the Bible.
Mr. Alberto Gomez lzquierdo, actually professor in the seminary
of Zaragoza, has contributed to the <i>Revista de Arag&oacute;n</i> and
the <i>Cultura Espa&ntilde;ola</i> numerous articles in which he has
ventilated interesting questions concerning the history of philosophy.
He has also published a <i>History of Philosophy in the XIX
century,</i> which is one of the most important and best documented
works we possess on the subject.  Mr. Gomez has entirely
omitted Spanish philosophy from his History, but he has promised
a separate volume on the subject, which all who are interested
in philosophical researches expect with feverish eagerness.<p>

John Joseph Urr&aacute;buru, S.J., published in 1890 eight big
Latin quarto volumes with the title <i>Institutiones Philosophicae.</i>
The first deals with Logic, the second with Ontology, the third
with Cosmology, the next three with Psychology, the last two
with Natural Theology.<p>

Some years afterwards, he exposed his teachings anew in a
more concise form, and published a <i>Compendium Philosophiae
Scholasticae</i> which, in spite of its modest title, consists of no less
than five large octavo volumes.<p>

Fr. Urr&aacute;buru's works constitute a monumental production,
one of the greatest treasures neo-Scholastic literature possesses.
In his method, Urr&aacute;buru is a pure Roman Thomist.  He uses
the Latin language, the syllogistic form, and proves the truth
of his teachings from the authority of the Church and the
Divine Revelation as often and as willingly as by human reason.
He differs from many Roman Thomists by his knowledge of
modern scientific results.  The conclusions he derives from these
results are not always justifiable, but his knowledge of the scientific
facts themselves cannot be denied.<p>

Urr&aacute;buru's work -- perhaps on account of the very method
they follow -- have not attracted the attention they deserve.
Their author's name is not even mentioned in Mr. Blanc's
<i>Dictionnaire de Philosophie,</i> published in 1906.  The actual
current of neo-Scholasticism, chiefly due to the influence of Mgr.
Mercier and the Institute of Louvain, is unfavorable to Urr&aacute;buru.
It professes that the Latin language ought to be discarded
in philosophical discussions, and that philosophy ought
to be regarded as a science which must go its own way, without
any predeterminate conclusion imposed by theological beliefs.
To the objection that this has not been the method followed by
St. Thomas, the Scholastics of Louvain would answer that St.
Thomas acted in harmony with the spirit of his time, and that,
if he lived now, he would likewise act in harmony with the spirit
and methods of our day.  This may be very true, but it proves
too much.  If St. Thomas lived to-day, a Positivist might ask,
if he breathed in our intellectual atmosphere, would he be a
Dominican?  Would he be a Scholastic?<p>

Urr&aacute;buru's method is perhaps, on the whole, more consistent
with the principles of Scholasticism than his opponents' view.
The Scholastics of Louvain are as profoundly convinced of the
truth of the doctrines of the Church as Urr&aacute;buru is.  They
believe as strongly as the eminent Spaniard that a philosophical
or a scientific conclusion opposed to the revealed truths is erroneous
and must be rejected.  If such be the case, and if the primary
aim of philosophy be the attainment of truth, is it not
illogical to abstain from taking theological doctrines as a guide
in philosophical investigations?<p>

A proof from Scripture will not appeal to the modern mind.
In Protestant countries especially it will sound as profoundly
unphilosophical.  But we must not forget that Urr&aacute;buru writes
in a Catholic country and for Catholic readers.  The spirit of
free interpretation has led Protestant theology very far.  Many
Protestant ministers to-day doubt the existence of hell, and a
few are inclined to transform a personal God into an ethical or
metaphysical principle.  The case of the Catholic clergy is quite
different.  All who are really Catholics flrmly believe, not only
in a personal God, who sees us and watches over us, in a hell in
which the reprobate will be tortured with the devils during the
whole eternity, but even in the Immaculate Conception and the
infallibility of the pope.<p>

It cannot be denied that the spirit of Louvain is more in harmony
with modern thought.  This is the reason why the works
published by the <i>Institut Sup&eacute;rieur de Philosophie</i> have been
translated into various languages and have attracted the attention
of all Europe, whereas Urr&aacute;buru's bulky volumes have been
forgotten in some dusty corner of a conventual library.  The
study of the works of the learned Jesuit is, however, indispensable
for an adequate understanding of the spirit of Scholasticism.<p>

Let us not leave Spain without mentioning some important
reviews which have greatly helped the cause of neo-Thomism.
<i>Raz&oacute;n y F&eacute;, La Ciudad de Dios,</i> the <i>Revista de Arag&oacute;n,</i> and
the <i>Cultura Espa&ntilde;ola</i> have published articles of great interest.  Of
greater interest still is the <i>Revista Luliana,</i> founded in
Barcelona in 1901, and whose aim is the publication and the critical
interpretation of the works of the Mediaeval Spanish philosopher
Raymond Lully.<p>
<p>

<b><a name="2">SECTION</a> 2. -- THE NEO-SCHOLASTIC REVIVAL IN PORTUGAL<A 
HREF="perrierg.html#X11"><SUP>[11]</sup></a></b><p>

The march of philosophy in Portugal is closely connected
with that of philosophy in Spain.  Both countries have been
inspired by the same masters, and have followed parallel directions
in their speculation.  By the end of the eigteenth century,
the dominant system in Portuguese institutions was a
sensism inspired by Locke and Condillac.  The Jesuits of
Coimbra, who alone clung to an orthodox Thomism, were severely
attacked by other religious orders, especially by the Oratorians
and Augustinians.  Condillac's <i>Art de Penser</i> was
translated into Portuguese and published in 1818.  The Oratorian
Fr. John the Baptist, the archdeacon Luiz Antonio Verney
and Theodoro d'Almeida frankly introduced modern systems
of thought into the Portuguese philosophical circles.<p>

Little was done in Portugal for a restoration of Thomism
before the publication of Leo XIII's encyclical. The few contributions
to Scholastic literature written in Portuguese during
that period, do not belong to Portugal proper, but to Asia or
America.<p>

In Macao, the Jesuit Francis X. Rondina (1827-1897), an
Italian by birth, published in 1869 a course of philosophy in
harmony with the Scholastic principles.  The title of the work
is:  <i>Compendio de Philosophia theoretica e pratica para uso da
mocidade portuguesa na China.</i>  The author has been directly
inspired by St. Thomas, Suarez, Goudin, Balmes, Gonzalez, and,
to a certain extent, by Rosmini.<p>

Two years later, Jose Soriano de Sousa, professor in Pernambuco
(Brazil), published his <i>Licoes de Philosophia elementar
racional e moral,</i> perfectly Thomistic in spirit, which he dedicated
to Emperor Pedro II.<p>

After the promulgation of the encyclical <i>Aeterni Patris,</i> the
Catholics of Portugal entered without hesitation into the spirit
of the Roman Pontiff.  By the philosophical academics they
founded, the reviews and the works they published, they have
assured to their country a conspicuous place in the history of
neo-Thomism.<p>

In 1881, an Academy of St. Thomas was founded in Coimbra,
and, by means of its organ, the review <i>Insticoes christas,</i>
actively contributed to turn the attention of Portugal to the
Thomistic revival.  The foundation of the Academy of St.
Thomas was soon followed by the publication of philosophical
works inspired by Scholastic principles. Among the writers
who thus served the cause of neo-Scholasticism, the best known
are Sinibaldi, Pereira Gomez de Carvalho and Madureira.<p>

Thiago Sinibaldi, professor in the seminary of Coimbra, published
lished in 1889 his <i>Praelectiones Philosophiae christianae,</i> and
three years later, his <i>Elementos de Philosophia,</i> which has been
honored by several editions.<p>

Clement Pereira Gomez de Carvalho, professor in the Central
Lyceum of Coimbra, is also the author of a work entitled <i>Elementos
de Philosophia,</i> which was published in 1894.<p>

Bernardo Augusto de Madureira, professor in the Faculty of
theology of the University of Coimbra, published, in 1884, a
poem entitled, <i>O sol d'Aquino,</i>  which deals with the life and the
philosophy of the Angelic Doctor, and was dedicated by the
author to the new-born Academy of St. Thomas.  Since that
time, Mr. Madureira has also published a manual of Elementary
Philosophy (1896).<p>

Another active supporter of neo-Thomism in Portugal is Mr.
Manuel Jose Martins Capella, to whose initiative is due the
foundation of a chair of Thomistic philosophy in the seminary
of Braga (1892).<p>

More recently, Mr. Teixera Guedes has organized in Santarem
a Philosophical and Literary Academy, whose aim is the diffusion
of the Thomistic doctrines among the people.  The Academy
has been inaugurated in 1897 by the Cardinal Archbishop
of Lisbon.<p>
<p>

<b><a name="3">SECTION</a> 3. -- THE NEO-SCHOLASTIC REVIVAL IN MEXICO</b><p>

By the middle of the nineteenth century, Scholastic philosophy
had practically disappeared from the Mexican soil.  Even
Catholics regarded with the greatest disrespect a system which,
in previous centuries, had been defended in Mexico by so many
illustrious thinkers.  From August, 1845, to May, 1847, there
was published in Mexico a religious, political, scientific and literary
periodical, known as <i>El Cat&oacute;lico.</i>  Its columns contained
numerous articles dealing with History of Philosophy, especially
with Scholasticism.  These articles were published anonymously,
but it appears from the works of the eminent historian
Valverde Tellez that they were due to the pen of the Jesuit
Arrillaga.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X12"><SUP>[12]</sup></a><p>

Arrillaga defines Scholasticism in terms of its method of
exposition, gives a cold praise to Abelard and Thomas Aquinas,
calling them "rare geniuses who, in another time, could have
done wonders," is particularly severe towards Duns Scotus,
speaks of Lully's <i>Ars magna</i> as of a collection of extravagances.
Similar views were current at the time.  The greatest Catholic
thinker Mexico has produced, Clemente de Jesus Mungu며, does
not absolutely escape them.  After exposing the Scholastic doctrine
about the origin of ideas, the distinguished bishop finds
himself at a loss to explain how "such an absurd theory could
enjoy so great a vogue, and for so long a time, among
philosophers."<A HREF="perrierg.html#X13"><SUP>[13]</sup></a><p>

The philosophical system of Mungu며, however, agrees in the
main with the principles of the School.  He who has been called
by his admirers "the Balmes of Mexico" may be regarded with
justice as one of the forerunners of the neo-Scholastic movement
in his country.  Our bibliography contains the titles of his most
important philosophical publications.<p>

The first man who, by his writings and his influence, directly
contributed to the revival of Thomism in Mexico is Bishop
Sollano.<p>

Jose Mar며 de Jesus Diez de Sollano y D&aacute;valos was born in
San Miguel de Allende (Guanajuato) in 1820.  After studying
in his native town and in Mexico, he was ordained priest in
1844, and became successively rector of the College of San
Gregorio, of the Seminary and of the University.  In 1863 he
was made bishop of Leon by Pius IX.  He died in 1881.<p>

The philosophical writings of Bishop Sollano are not of great
importance.  They are limited to an annotated edition of Roux's
Logic, a pastoral letter dealing with the encyclical <i>AEterni
Patris,</i> and a dissertation about the Immaculate Conception.
Nevertheless, Sollano must be regarded as one of the best propagators
of neo-Scholasticism in Mexico, on account of the influence
he exercised upon the direction of philosophy in making
of his seminary of Leon one of the most active centers of neo-
Thomism.<p>

From all parts of the Mexican republic there soon arose distinguished
writers to defend the essential principles of Scholastic
philosophy, so that the neo-Scholastic movement in Mexico
can compare without too much disadvantage with the same
movement in European nations.<p>

Agustin de la Rosa (born 1824), canon of Guadalajara,
defended the Scholastic doctrine of truth in his <i>Consideraciones
filos&oacute;ficas sobre la Verdad y la Certidumbre</i> (1870).<p>

Jos&eacute; M. de Jes&uacute;s Portugal, bishop of Aguascalientes, wrote,
with the titles of <i>El Amable Jesus</i> and <i>La Santa voluntad de
Dios,</i> excellent commentaries on the works of St. Thomas.  <i>El
Amable Jesus</i> is a commentary on the third part of the <i>Summa
Theologica,</i> whereas <i>La Santa Voluntad de Dios</i> deals with the
<i>Summa contra Gentiles.</i><p>

Agustin F. Villa greatly facilitated the study of Scholastic
philosophy by the publication of a Vocabulary of Scholastic
Terms (1879).<p>

Nicanor Lozada published in 1880 his <i>Apuntes de L&oacute;gica,</i>
Cosmolog며 y Psicolog며.  This work is not a course of Scholastic
philosophy.  As its title indicates, it simply consists of notes
and observations destined to give to the students a clear intelligence
of some obscure points of the text-book they were using.
This text-book was Grandclaude's <i>Breviarium Philosophiae
Scholasticae.</i><p>

Rafael Cagigas (1864-1890), whose premature death has
been a great loss to Mexican philosophical literature, manifests
an enthusiastic admiration for the Thomistic doctrine, in his
volume of works published in 1890.  With the soul of a poet,
the young writer studies the most abstruse philosophical doctrines.
The theory of Matter and Form is for him a boundless
harmony, which he sees reflected in the human mind.  Cagigas
is perhaps too severe for modern philosophy, as may be gathered
from the following fragment of a speech he pronounced in the
Catholic Circle of Mexico, on January 19, 1890:<p>

"Modern philosophy, from Descartes to this day, is in a state
of evident decay.  She declares it herself with furious cries,
appearing to the eyes of the crowd as a collection of all errors,
as a sink of all filth, as the ruin of all spirits, as a labyrinth
where the wisest man himself is suddenly confounded.  What is

Secundino Brice&ntilde;o, besides an opuscule on the syllogism and
a dissertation dealing with St. Thomas's doctrine about the
Immaculate Conception, has written a comparative study of the
Spencerian and Scholastic philosophy.  The title of this work
is <i>Ligeros Apuntes sobre la Filosof며 de Spencer comparada con
la Filosof며 Escol&aacute;stica.</i>  Its aim is to oppose the powerful
current of positivism which, due to the influence of Barreda and
Porfirio Parra, has been for a long time the official philosophy
in Mexico.  Brice&ntilde;o limits his considerations to Spencer's First
Principles, and skilfully points out the contradictions contained
in the doctrine of the English philosopher.<p>

An able representative of neo-Scholasticism in Mexico is the
Dominican Guillermo Garcia.  A Spaniard by birth, now professor
of dogmatic theology in the seminary of San Luis Potosi,
Fr. Garcia has written, besides a pamphlet on St. Bonaventure,
a historical study entitled <i>Tomismo y Neotomismo.</i>  The aim
of this treatise is to give a full account of the works and the
philosophical doctrines of Thomas Aquinas, to compare his
philosophy with the modern currents of thought, to give a historical
survey of the Thomistic philosophy throughout the ages.
The part of the work dealing with modern philosophical systems
has not much value.  It is easy to see that Fr. Garcia is not
precisely at home when he deals with Locke, Kant, Fichte and
Hegel.  His knowledge of St. Thomas, on the other hand, is
certainly thorough.  His admiration for the Angelic Doctor is
even exaggerated.  He feels proud of the rule of the Dominican
order, which commands to follow St. Thomas in every point,
<i>in omnibus, omnino,</i> under the most severe penalties, obliges to
a vow of fidelity to his doctrines, and regards as impious the
slightest deviation from them.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X15"><SUP>[15]</sup></a><p>

Now, such a rule is not only unphilosophical, but anti-
Thomistic.  There is nothing more opposed to the spirit of a
philosopher than a systematic and uncritical adherence to each
proposition he has maintained.  Philosophy is essentially a
thinking study of things.  We must carefully meditate the
works of our predecessors, we must try to understand their
meaning, to grasp their train of thought, but we are philosophers
only in so far as we think with our own head.  All great
thinkers have studied the various philosophical systems, but
they have not servilely adhered to them.  They have marked
their works with the seal of their own individuality.  St.
Thomas is no exception to this rule.<p>

Happily for philosophy, the Dominicans do not seem to observe
very strictly the rule of which Fr. Garc며 is so proud.
Strange to say, Garc며 himself furnishes us ample proofs of this
assertion.  A section of <i>Tomismo y Neotom몁mo</i> is devoted to
a defence of the Dominican order against the charge of intolerance.
The author gives the names of notable members of the
order who have more or less departed from St. Thomas's teaching
without being molested.  He speaks of Thomas de Vio
Cajetanus, of Ambroso Catarino, of Thomas Campanella, and
more especially of Durandus of St. Pourcain, a "powerful
opponent of the philosophy of the Angelic Doctor," who lived
and died in the Dominican order without ever suffering the
slightest persecution.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X16"><SUP>[16]</sup></a><p>

This is not the only contradiction which <i>Tomismo y Neotomismo</i>
contains.  Fr. Garc며's position as regards neo-Scholasticism
is far from being clear.  He declares that his view of the
Thomistic movement is in harmony with the view of the Louvain
school, and he gives an excellent program of neo-Scholasticism
to which every professor of Louvain would subscribe.  On the
other hand, he quotes with approval Cornoldi's famous phrase
describing modern philosophy as the pathology of human reason,
and cannot blame Orti y Lara for regarding modern thought as
resting upon error and sin.<p>

In spite of these defects, <i>Tomismo y Neotomismo</i> is a valuable
little work.  It contains important historical data about the
Thomistic movement.  The five chapters dealing with the philosophy
of St. Thomas in the Dominican order are particularly
interesting.  Fr. Garc며 is actually preparing a treatise on St.
Thomas's sociology.  We sincerely hope that this new work will
be, like <i>Tomismo y Neotomismo,</i> a precious contribution to neo-
Scholastic literature.<p>

No Mexican, however, deserves the thanks of all lovers of
Scholastic philosophy so greatly as Mr. Valverde Tellez.<p>

Emeterio Valverde Tellez, a canon of the cathedral of Mexico,
has written, besides a treatise on truth, three historical works
of great importance:  the <i>Apuntaciones hist&oacute;ricos sobre la
Filosof며 en Mexico</i> (1896); the <i>Cr몂ica Filos&oacute;fica</i> (1904); and the
<i>Bibliograf며 Filos&oacute;fica Mexicana</i> (1907).<p>

In the <i>Apuntaciones hist&oacute;ricas,</i> Mr. Valverde, after general
considerations on the nature, of philosophy and a weak defense
of Metaphysics against the attacks of Positivism, traces the
great lines of Mexican speculation, gives valuable informations
about the libraries and the centers of learning in Mexico, leads
us through the vicissitudes of the Mexican University since its
foundation in 1521 to its final suppression in 1868, and the
foundation of the new Pontifical University in 1896.  He then
passes to a detailed and critical study of the various philosophical
ical systems in his country.  He analyzes the works and the
doctrines of all great Mexican thinkers.<p>

In spite of his enthusiastic admiration for St. Thomas, Mr.
Valverde does full justice to the philosophers of other schools.
His study of the recent positivistic movement in Mexico and of
the violent discussions to which it has given rise is excellent.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X17"><SUP>[17]</sup></a><p>

The <i>Cr몂ica Filos&oacute;fica</i> completes the <i>Apuntaciones</i> by
furnishing new data, by making us know philosophical works completely
unknown, and unearthed by the patient labor of the author.<p>

The <i>Bibliograf며 Filos&oacute;fica Mexicana</i> gives us, with the greatest
exactitude, the list of all philosophical productions written
in Mexico.  Each work is preceded by a biographical sketch of
its author and followed by a critical analysis, so that the
<i>Bibliograf며</i> is indispensable to all who are interested in the march
of philosophical speculation among the Spanish race.<p>

<b><a name="4">SECTION</a> 4. -- THE NEO-SCHOLASTIC REVIVAL IN SOUTH AMERICA</b><p>

Among the countries which have eagerly embraced the cause
of the Scholastic revival, Colombia deserves a special attention.
Thomism has become, as it were, its official philosophy, and,
more than anywhere else perhaps, has identified itself with the
spirit of the nation.<p>

When, in the middle of the last century, Bentham's utilitarian
ethical system was introduced into Colombia, it was opposed by
some of the most eminent Colombian writers.  Margallo, M. M.
Mallarino, Ricardo de la Parra, Joaquin Mosquera, Mario
Valenzuela, and more especially Jos&eacute; Eusebio Caro (1817-1853)
and his illustrious son, Miguel Antonio Caro, defended the
Thomistic moral system with much ability and success.<p>

Miguel Antonio Caro, born in Bogot&aacute; on November 10, 1843,
is chiefly known as a politician and a man of letters. As a
politician, he has exercised an immense influence upon the government
of his country, and has been intrusted with the high
office of president.  Among his literary achievements, which
have given him a conspicuous place in the history of Spanish
literature, let us mention his admirable translation of Virgil
into Spanish verse.  His most lasting title to the gratitude of
Philosophy is his <i>Estudio sobre el Utilitarismo,</i> which has been
proclaimed worthy of Joseph de Maistre.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X18"><SUP>[18]</sup></a><p>

The most important center of Thomism in Colombia is actually
the College of the Rosary (Colegio Mayor de Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario) in Bogota.<p>

As early as 1881, Rafael Maria Carrasquilla (born in Bogota
on December 18, 1857, and president of the College of the
Rosary since 1891) proclaimed his adherence to the philosophy
imposed by Pope Leo XIII on the Catholic world.  "To the
modern errors," said he, "we must oppose the entire truth, even
if we offend the pride of our century of progress, by exhibiting
a monk of the thirteenth century as a model of wisdom."<A HREF="perrierg.html#X19"><SUP>[19]</sup></a><p>

The program thus sketched by Mr. Carrasquilla has been
faithfully carried out.  All the works and essays the College
has produced have been inspired by the purest Thomistic principles,
so that the history of the College of the Rosary during
the last fifteen years forms one of the most interesting pages
of a history of neo-Scholasticism.<p>

The adherence of the college to the principles of the Angelic
Doctor does not, however, degenerate into servility. It is essentially
eclectic and progressive.  The new constitutions of the
college strongly insist upon the fact that we must follow the
Scholastics wherever their philosophy is acceptable in the light,
of modern criticism, and reject their doctrines if they have
proved erroneous or inadequate.<A HREF="perrierg.html#X20"><SUP>[20]</sup></a><p>

The most important work of Mr. Carrasqiiilla is the volume
entitled, <i>Ensayo sobre la doctrina liberal,</i> which has obtained
him the honor of being described as a "republican Balmes."<p>

By its title, the <i>Ensayo sobre la Doctrina Liberal</i> seems to
belong to political science rather than to philosophy. It is as
a philosophical system, however, that Mr. Carrasquilla studies
liberalism, which he refutes by the Thomistic social principles.
"Liberalism," says he, "is above all a philosophical school,
which a priest may study and refute with the same right wherewith
he would combat Descartes, Hegel or Rosmini.["21]<p>

Among the men who have contributed to give to the College
of the Rosary the Thomistic direction it has to-day, none is more
conspicuous than Mr. Julian Restrepo Hern&aacute;ndez, professor of
logic and anthropology in the college since 1892.<p>

Born in Bogot&aacute; on July 23, 1871, Julian Restrepo Hern&aacute;ndez
studied in the College of the Rosary and showed such philosophical
acumen that he was placed in the chair of logic in 1890,
while still a student in the college.  Later on, he studied law
and wrote for the Colombian government the <i>Codificacion
Cundinamarquesa,</i> which contains the entire legislation of Colombia
and forms a volume of 1208 pages folio.<p>

Mr. Restrepo, however, has not neglected philosophy and has
recently (1907) published a volume on logic (<i>Lecciones de
L&oacute;gica,</i> in which he has embodied the lectures given to the students
of the College of the Rosary.<p>

The qualities which distinguish this work have been very skilfully
pointed out by the distinguished literary critic Rufino Jos&eacute;
Cuervo, in a personal letter to the author:  "The pleasure I
experienced at the reading of your volume on Logic, says Mr.
Cuervo, comes chiefly from the clearness, precision and rigorous
method of the work, in which ancient and modern learning are
combined, so that truth may appear more luminous and
attractive."<A HREF="perrierg.html#X22"><SUP>[22]</sup></a><p>

Mr. Restrepo's Logic, besides its intrinsic value as an exposition
of the Scholastic logical principles, is worthy of attention
for a theory of the modes of the hypothetical syllogism, which
constitutes a direct contribution of the author to the field of
logic.<p>

Since 1905, the College of the Rosary also publishes an important
review (<i>Revista del Colegio Mayor de Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora
del Rosario</i>) which is undoubtedly one of the most excellent
South American periodical publications. Its field is not confined
to philosophy.  It treats likewise of literature, education,
history, and seldom fails to give a delightful piece of poetry.<p>

From a philosophical point of view, the most important contribution
of the review is the essay entitled <i>Santo Tom&aacute;s ante
la ciencia moderna,</i> of Francisco Maria Rengifo, now professor
in the college.<p>

Mr. Rengifo studies the modern theories defended by mathematics
and science and shows that they are in perfect harmony
with the essential principles of Thomism.<p>

Let us not leave the College of the Rosary without mentioning
the interesting work entitled <i>La Filosofia Positivista,</i> written by
Samuel Ramirez (1875-1908), as a dissertation for the degree
of Doctor of Philosophy.  After giving a detailed history of
the various positivistic schools, Mr. Ramirez demonstrates the
superiority of the Thomistic principles over the doctrines of
Comte and his disciples.<p>

The Rev. Luis Ortiz, S.J., professor in the College of San
Bartolom&eacute;, has contributed to Colombian neo-Scholastic literature
a little work entitled <i>La Vida</i> (Life). The thesis defended
by the author is the following:  "The doctrine of the
Angelic Doctor and of Fr. Suarez, defending the existence of a
vital principle, which informs living beings and is essentially
distinct from the physico-chemical forces of brute matter, is
confirmed by the observations of modern science; or, more
briefly, the physical and chemical forces are inadequate to explain
life."<p>

The proofs adduced by Fr. Ortiz in defence of this thesis are
a development of the following argument:  The essences of
things are known from the operations and properties of these
things.  The operations and properties of inorganic matter are
essentially different from those which characterize living beings.
Therefore, the nature of living beings is essentially different
from that of inorganic matter.<p>

Colombia is not the only South American republic in which
the spirit of the Thomistic revival has penetrated.  The most
important contribution of South America to the cause of neo-
Scholasticism came from Chile and was due to Francisco Ginebra,
of the Society of Jesus.<p>

Ginebra's <i>Elementos de Filosofia,</i> published in 1887 in Santiago
(Chile), has deservedly run into several editions.  It is
one of the most valuable text-books on Scholastic philosophy
which the neo-Scholastic revival has produced.  The author has
been chiefly inspired by St. Thomas, Suarez, Liberatore, Kleutgen,
Cornoldi and Balmes.<p>

The <i>Elementos de Filosofia</i> is completed by a treatise on
Natural Law (<i>Elementos de Derecho Natural</i>), which is also a
very important work, and has been adopted as a text-book in
several of the South American schools of law.
