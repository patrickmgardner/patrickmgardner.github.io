The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter XV: The Neo-Scholastic Revival in the United States and 
Canada</h1><hr><p>

<b><a name="1">SECTION</a> 1. -- THE NEO-SCHOLASTIC REVIVAL IN THE UNITED STATES</b><p>

Stanley Hall's half-serious, half-jocose words, that "philosophers
are as scarce in America as snakes in Norway," could not,
without injustice, be repeated to-day.  During these last years
the European philosophical publications have so frequently
studied the works and opinions of our writers that we may, without
too much presumption, entertain the belief that philosophy
has at last established a permanent settlement among us.<p>

In this phase of our intellectual growth, our Catholic writers
have naturally turned their attention to the official philosophy
of the Church, so that neo-Thomism, although it has produced
in our country no work which may compare with the great
European contributions, has nevertheless given rise to excellent
treatises which no student of the recent Thomistic movement
should neglect.<p>

In the middle of the last century the greatest Catholic writer
in America was Orestes A. Brownson (1803-1876).  His philosophy,
which may be described as a form of ontologism, exercised
a great influence upon American Catholics.  Gioberti
became the man in whose works the only true philosophy was
supposed to be found.<p>

Among the writers who were thus controlled by ontologistic
principles, one of the best known is Henry A. Brann (born in
1839).  In his <i>"Curious Questions,"</i> published in 1866, he does
not hesitate to call Gioberti the greatest philosopher of the
nineteenth century.<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a>  According to Mr. Brann, God is an object of
direct intuition:  "From the mere fact of intuition," says he, "we
prove the existence of God.  We intue God existing, and therefore
we say He exists.  This argument is the strongest on account
of its clearness."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a><p>

In some of his works, however, Mr. Brann is in perfect agreement
with the principles of the Scholastics, and even follows
their line of reasoning.  The small work, <i>The Spirituality and
Immortality of the Human Soul,</i> were it not for its preface,
might well be regarded as a production of the most orthodox
neo-Thomist.<p>

To the Jesuits belongs the honor not only of having been the
first defenders of Thomism in the United States, but of having
furnished the larger and more valuable part of our neo-Scholastic
literature.<p>

The first works written in defense of Scholastic principles in
this country were due to Louis Jouin, S.J. (1818-1899), professor
of philosophy in St. John's College, now Fordham University.
Father Jouin's works comprise two volumes in Latin:
<i>Elementa Philosophiae Moralis</i> (1865), and <i>Compendium Logicae
et Metaphysicae</i> (1869), and a shorter manual in English:  <i>Logic
and Metaphysics.</i>  They have been honored by numerous editions
and are still used as text-books in several institutions.<p>

Not long afterwards, another series of text-books on Scholastic
philosophy was written by Walter H. Hill (1822-1907).  His
<i>"Elements of Philosophy,"</i> of which numerous editions have
been made, was published in 1873, for the use of the students
of St. Louis University, in which he was professor of philosophy.
The <i>Elements of Philosophy</i> was soon followed by the
volume, <i>Ethics, or Moral Philosophy</i> (1878).  Besides these
two works, Father Hill has written, in defence of the Scholastic
principles, numerous articles in the <i>American Catholic Quarterly</i>
(cf. Bibliography).<p>

The year 1873 was also the date of the publication of Schiffini's
<i>Logicae gernalis Institutiones.</i>  An Italian by birth, professor
in the house of studies of the Jesuits in Woodstock (Maryland),
Biagio A. Schiffini embodied in his work the lessons he
had given to the scholastics.  He subsequently published some
of St. Thomas's treatises:  the <i>De Homine,</i> in 1882, and the <i>De
Motu Hominis in Deum,</i> in 1883.<p>

Among the courses of Scholastic philosophy written by the
Jesuits in the United States, the most valuable are probably the
two volumes of Nicholas Russo (born April 24, 1845 died
April 1, 1902).  His <i>Summa Philosophica</i> (Boston, 1885), in
which he generally follows Liberatore, more complete than
Jouin's works, is generally regarded as the most satisfactory
exposition of Scholastic philosophy published in this country.
In his <i>De Philosophia Morali</i> (1890), Fr. Russo published the
lectures he had delivered to the students, when professor of
moral philosophy in Georgetown University.<p>

Among the courses of Scholastic philosophy thus written with
special regard to the needs of the students, we must also mention
the works of Charles Coppens and William Poland.<p>

William Poland, born in Cincinnati in 1848, and professor of
philosophy in St. Louis University, is the author of several
treatises in which the fundamental principles of Scholasticism
are expounded and defended in the clearest and most attractive
style.  His <i>"Truth of Thought"</i> (1896) is an excellent text-
book on criteriology.  Like all Scholastics, Father Poland holds
a middle position between the idealist and the materialist.  He
skilfully points out the inconsistency of subjectivism,<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a> and
proves the objective character of reality by means of the evidence
whereby it is presented to us as objective:<p>

"Just as in the perception or knowing of self, I affirm self,
so also, for the same reason, evidence, I affirm, with inevitable
conviction, the objective value of non-self.  I have a thought or
a headache.  The thought or the headache presents itself to me
as mine.  I thereupon have a conviction that it is mine.  Of
this conviction, certified in the perception of what is evident, I
cannot rid myself, and I hold to it.  The midnight glory of the
stars presents itself to me as a something which excludes the
element of myself.  I have, thereupon, a conviction of that
something, as strong as the conviction of my own thought; and
simultaneously I have a conviction that that something is distinct
from me.  Of this conviction, certified in the perception
of what is evident, I cannot rid myself; and I hold to it."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a><p>

The doctrine contained in this quotation is not, however, perfectly
clear.  We believe a thought to be subjective and the
starred sky objective, because the former depends upon our will,
while the latter does not; because we can have or reject a thought
at pleasure, whereas, if our eyes are open, we are compelled to
see the sky.  But, why should a headache be any less objective
than the starred sky?  Does it depend upon a flat of our will?
Can it be rejected as readily as we please?  It is an affection
of our body; it will perhaps be replied, and our body belongs
to our own self.  But our vision of the starred sky is a sensation
of color which belongs to our body just as well.  Why, then,
should the sky be objective and the headache subjective?  This
is a question which Fr. Poland does not face.<p>

Charles Coppens expounded the fundamental principles of
Scholastic philosophy in two small volumes:  <i>A Brief Text-book
of Logic and Mental Philosophy</i> (1892), and <i>A Brief Text-book
of Moral Philosophy</i> (1896).  He also published, in 1897, a
remarkable work upon which his fame chiefly rests:  <i>Moral Principles
and Medical Practice.</i>  In the light of the Christian principles
about the human soul, Fr. Coppens closely examines some
subjects, such as craniotomy and abortion, which are of burning
interest in the field of medicine.  He also studies the questions
of insanity and hypnotism, and lays down, in the most able
manner, the professional rights and duties of the physician.<p>

The American Jesuits have not thus limited themselves to
the writing of Scholastic text-books.  Such works, however serviceable
they may be, exist now in so great a number that new
ones cannot but repeat what others have already said.  Fr. Coppens's
work is one of those studies on particular questions to
which neo-Scholastics should now direct their attention.  Another
study in the same direction has been made by Rene I.
Holaind in his <i>Natural Law and Legal Practice</i> (1899), which
contains the lectures he delivered at the Law School of Georgetown
University.  Fr.  Holaind carefully studies the capital
questions of taxation, capital and labor organizations, strikes
and boycotts, etc.  The solutions he gives are inspired by the
principles of Christian philosophy, and perfectly adapted to the
actual conditions of society.  Not only all students of law, but
all American citizens should read and meditate this work.<p>

John J. Ming, professor of Moral Philosophy in Canisius
College (Buffalo), besides numerous articles in the <i>American
Catholic Quarterly,</i> has contributed to American neo-Scholastic
ethics a precious work, entitled <i>The Data of Modern Ethics
Examined.</i><p>

The aim of the author, as set forth in his preface, is to defend
Christian ethics against the recent moral systems advanced by
the modern schools of Positivists and Agnostics.<p>

The several forms assumed by hedonism are faithfully exposed
and examined at great length.  The author is fully conversant
with the theories of Spencer, J. S. Mill, and other English
empiricists.  His criticisms are often excellent, always interesting,
and display a remarkable power of analysis.<p>

The hedonistic system of ethics is not, however, as Fr. Ming
seems to imply, essentially connected with positivism and agnosticism.
The strongest believer in the spirituality of the soul
might be as frankly and as consistently a hedonist as Mill or
Spencer.  A refutation of materialism or agnosticism will not
therefore be, at the same time, a refutation of hedonism.  This
is a truth which Fr. Ming seems to have overlooked.  As his
work is a treatise on ethics, it ought to attack frankly hedonism
itself, and to lay less emphasis upon the philosophical systems
with which hedonism is but accidentally connected.<p>

It is true that the characteristic fallacy of hedonism -- its confusing
the result of a moral act with the nature of the act -- has
been perfectly grasped by Fr. Ming:<p>

"Delight is necessary to happiness," says he. "Every perfect
action is followed by delight; for it lies in the nature of a faculty
that, having discharged the function for which it was made,
perfectly and normally, it comes to rest and is satisfied.  But
for the very reason that delight is not the action itself, but
merely its result or concomitant, it cannot be an essential constituent
of happiness:  it is but one of its necessary attributes
that adheres to it as beauty does to youth."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV5"><SUP>[5]</sup></a><p>

This capital flaw of hedonism might have been, however, more
strongly insisted upon.<p>

On the, whole, Fr.  Ming's work is one of the best productions
of neo-Scholastic literature in the field of ethics, and deserves
the careful study of all interested in moral philosophy.<p>

In the field of Natural Theology, an important contribution
has been made by Maurice Ronayne (1828-1903).  His work,
<i>God knowable and known,</i> published in 1888, has been deservedly
honored by several editions.  Departing from the usual
form in which philosophical treatises are cast, Fr. Ronayne has
made use of the dialogue with the greatest skill. The interlocutors
meet, now in Fifth Avenue Hotel, now in Central Park
amid the scenes of nature, and discuss, in the most attractive
language, all questions connected with natural theology.<p>

Other fields of philosophy are incidentally touched upon.
The second chapter of the work, entitled:  <i>The Data of Natural
Knowledge,</i> contains a fair exposition of the Scholastic theory
of knowledge, as well as an able refutation of idealism.<p>

Fr. Ronayne also studies the Scholastic doctrines of causation
and substance.  He unmistakably regards substance as an unknown
something lying behind the accidents.  Speaking of the
phenomenalists, he says:  "They do not take gold for silver, nor
silver for copper, because these metals differ in the phenomenon
of color, but because of something beneath that color and partially
manifested by it."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV6"><SUP>[6]</sup></a><p>

Mention must also be made of AEmilius de Augustinis, for
his work, <i>De Deo Uno secundum naturam</i> (1884), and James
Conway (1849-1905), professor in St. Louis University, and
author of a small volume entitled, <i>The Fundamental Principles
of Christian Ethics,</i> which belongs to the series, <i>Catholic
Summer and Winter School Library.</i><p>

Thomism has also found distinguished representatives in
other religious orders.  A name that readily comes to one's
mind at the consideration of Scholasticism outside of the Society
of Jesus is that of Brother Azarias, of the Christian Schools.
Brother Azarias, born Patrick Francis Mullany (1847-1893),
is one of the most distinguished -- the most distinguished perhaps--
of our Catholic writers.  Although known chiefly as a
literary critic, he is the author of several philosophical works
well worthy of attention.  Whether he is a great philosopher
or not, I will not here decide.  About his originality as a
thinker, no doubt can be entertained.  In his <i>Essays
philosophical,</i> he gives the following principle as the first principle of
philosophy:  "God actualizes Cosmos by the Word, and completes
its end in the Word."  Which he unriddles in the following
manner:<p>

"In the term God, we have the subject of Theodicy and Natural
Theology.<p>

"In the term Cosmos, we have the idea that gives us the ideas
of space and time, with all their concomitant ideas of number,
extension, mathematics, natural history and physics.<p>

"In the term the Word is contained the type of creation--
the basis of history -- the ideal of literature and art.<p>

"In the term completes its destiny in the Word, we have the
whole supernatural order -- a Church, the means of sanctification.<p>

"In the term actualizes, we have the idea of pure and supreme
cause expressed, and the real relations of the Creator to his
creation."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV7"><SUP>[7]</sup></a><p>

Brother Azarias thus regards philosophy as embracing all
human knowledge, natural and supernatural.  This view unequivocally
separates him from the neo-Scholastics, to whose
school, it is true, he does not profess to belong:<p>

"To belong exclusively to any school of thought," says he, "is
to shut out from one's soul all truth but that which presents
itself under a given aspect.  It is to be continually asking the
question, Can any good come out of Nazareth?  And Yet good
can come out of Nazareth; every Nazareth of thought has its
own lesson to teach us if we willingly learn it and put it to
profit."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV8"><SUP>[8]</sup></a><p>

Although Brother Azarias is not, strictly speaking, a Scholastic,
he has done good service to the cause of neo-Scholasticsm
in this country by his learned treatises on Mediaeval philosophy.
The essay, <i>Aristotle and the Christian Church,</i> contains
excellent pages dealing with the spirit of the schoolmen.  Albert
the Great, St. Thomas and Roger Bacon are chiefly dealt with.
The author clearly shows that the Mediveval writers were not servile
followers of Aristotle, but that they thought and wrote in
the, spirit of real philosophers.  How Brother Azarias regards
the Scholastic revival is clearly indicated in the following
statement:<p>

"Finally, there is the intellectual atmosphere of the day in
which thought lives and moves.  It cannot exist without breathing
this air.  If the past is revived, it lives only in proportion
as it is brought to bear upon the present."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV9"><SUP>[9]</sup></a><p>

Brother Chrysostom, born Joseph J. Conlan, in New Haven
(Connecticut), in 1863, and actually professor of philosophy in
Manhattan College (New York), is more strictly a Scholastic
than Brother Azarias.  He is the author of two brief courses of
Scholastic philosophy.  One of them, the <i>Elementary Course of
Christian Philosophy,</i> is an adaptation of a French work written
by Brother Louis of Poissy, and, in spite of its concise form, is
one of the most instructive manuals published in this country.
The other course, written in Latin, was published in 1897, under
the title, <i>Elementa Philosophiae Scholasticae.</i>  It deals with
logic, ontology or general metaphysics, and cosmology, and is
chiefly inspired by the works of Zigliara, Liberatore and Farges.<p>

Brother Chrysostom has also defended the cause of Scholastic
philosophy in several review articles.  The most important of
them appeared in the <i>Philosophical Review</i> in 1894, and was
devoted to the study of the theistic argument of St. Thomas.<p>

In the Dominican order, we find a single work worthy of
mention; but this work is one of the best studies written by
American neo-Scholastics.  <i>La Philosophie en Am&eacute;rique depuis
les origines jusqu'&agrave; nos jours</i> of Father Edward Gregory
Laurence Van Becelaere (born 1872), was published in 1904,
after having appeared in the form of articles in the <i>Revue
Thomiste.</i>  As a study of the various currents of thought which
have dominated our country, Fr. Van Becelaere's work, despite
its brevity, is the best work we possess.  Some aspects of American
thought have been, however, entirely overlooked or too
briefly treated.  A history of American philosophy ought certainly
to contain a chapter on Pragmatism.<p>

Fr. Van Becelaere's volume is completed by an appendix dealing
with Catholic philosophy in the United States.  This part
of the work of the learned Dominican contains interesting details
on the neo-Scholastic revival in this country.<p>

Scholastic principles have also found able defenders in our
secular clergy.<p>

Gennaro Luigi Vincenzo de Concilio, born at Naples (Italy),
in 1835, and for a short time professor of dogmatic theology,
logic and metaphysics in Seton Hall College, South Orange,
New Jersey, published, besides a text-book on Scholastic philosophy
(<i>Elements of Intellectual Philosophy,</i> 1878), a theologico-
philosophical work, entitled <i>Catholicity and Pantheism</i>
(1874), in which he regards Pantheism as the necessary result
of Protestantism,<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV10"><SUP>[10]</sup></a> as the universal error in time and space.<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV11"><SUP>[11]</sup></a>
"Every particular error, says he, has either fallen into Pantheism,
or disappeared altogether.<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV12"><SUP>[12]</sup></a><p>

John Gmeiner, born in Baernau (Bavaria), on December 5,
1847, and, for seven years, professor at St. Francis Seminary
(Milwaukee), and at St. Thomas Seminary (St. Paul), has
published several philosophical works, in which, in harmony
with Leo XIII's formula:  <i>vetera novis augere,</i> he endeavors to
harmonize the Scholastic teachings with modern science, and
mercilessly discards all tenets which cannot be easily harmonized.
In a remarkable little work, entitled <i>Mediaeval and Modern
Cosmology</i> (1891), he denounces some theories, usually
defended in Catholic text-books, and which, in his opinion,
reflect but little credit upon Catholic thinking.  Among the
doctrines thus stigmatized is the theory of Matter and Form.<p>

John T. Driscoll, born in Albany (New York), after studying
in Manhattan College and Troy Theological Seminary, completed
his studies in the Catholic University.  He has taught
philosophy for several years in the Theological Seminary at
Brighton (Massachusetts) and has enriched American neo-
Scholastic literature with two excellent works:  <i>A Treatise on
the Human Soul,</i> published in 1898, and God, which appeared
two years later.<p>

The method followed in these two works may be characterized
as experimental and comparative.  In the <i>Treatise on the
Human Soul,</i> the author starts from the facts of our consciousness:
sensations, sentiments, ideas, memories, judgments, reasonings,
etc., which are "as true and real as the circulation of
the blood, or the existence of physical or chemical forces."
From such facts of experience he derives, by a process of reasoning,
his system as to the nature of the soul.<p>

In agreement with the, Scholastic teaching, he proves the
principle of our bodily and mental energies to be one and simple,
spiritual and immortal.<p>

Scholastic psychology is studied in connection with all adverse
teachings.  All ancient and modern systems concerning the
principle of life in man are discussed with a remarkable erudition
and brought face to face with the Scholastic theories.<p>

The inadequacy of Materialism and Positivism is very ably
pointed out.  The work also contains valuable chapters on the
diverse forms of Pantheism and Monism.  Some conclusions of
the author do not seem, however, perfectly justifiable.  He rejects,
for example, Kant's opinion that we know phenomena
only, and not the thing-in-itself, on the ground that such an
opinion is opposed to the data and methods of physical science:<p>

"Science," says he, "deals with real things.  The axioms and
rules of mathematical science must be verified in concrete objects
in order that the calculations founded upon them may have
any validity.  The same is true of chemistry and of physics."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV13"><SUP>[13]</sup></a><p>

This objection would be perfectly valid if Kant failed to recognize
in the phenomena an objective element.  But this is not
the case.  The phenomenon is subjective in so far as the outside
reality, the object, is clothed with the conditions of our sensibility
and of our understanding; but it is also objective, inasmuch
as it is caused by the thing-in-itself.<p>

We are, with regard to the thing-in-itself, in the same position
as a person with a pair of colored glasses would be with
regard to the color of a landscape.  Although such a person
would never know the color of the landscape as it is in itself,
he would nevertheless be able to possess a real science of color,
to formulate laws, which would be conditioned by the object and
in harmony with its manifestations.<p>

The aim of the treatise on God is thus set forth in the preface:<p>

"The considerations adduced are the heritage of Christian
Philosophy handed down by the pens of St. Augustine and St.
Thomas.  The marvelous advance in the sciences furnishes increased
data for argument and illustration.  The question is
considered under all aspects.  All sources of knowledge are
investigated.  History, Language, Psychology, Ethics, the Physical
sciences, each comes with its special testimony.  The aim is
simply to eollect the data and show their bearing on the idea of
God; to answer the question:  What is meant by God, and has
the idea of God an objective validity?"<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV14"><SUP>[14]</sup></a><p>

Like all modern Scholastics, Mr. Driscoll rejects the ontological
argument, in its original shape as well as in the form it has
assumed in the hands of the neo-Hegelian school.  He also
rejects the theory of direct intuition of the Divine Being, advocated
by Harris, Wilson, Caird, and other non-Catholic writers
of the present day.  He regards as valid the arguments from
universal consent, from the moral life, from the contingency of
living beings, from a first cause, froih motion, from the order
of the universe.  He also accepts the old argument drawn from
the nature of truth, first proposed by St. Augustine, and recently
revived by Josiah Royce.  He clearly points out, however, that,
in the hands of Mr. Royce, the argument loses its value and
involves a <i>petitio principii:</i><p>

"What is (for Royce) the test of subjective truth?  Not conformity
with external reality.  This he expressly rejects.  But
conformity with a higher intelligence.  Hence he is a disciple
of Berkeley.  Hence he falls into a <i>petitio principii.</i>  He sets
forth with the data of consciousness to reason God's existence as
absolute Truth.  Yet he postulates the existence of the All-
Knower or All-Enfolder to justify the veracity of the data.
This was the mistake of Descartes."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV15"><SUP>[15]</sup></a><p>

Mr. Driscoll, as we have seen, has been a student in the Catholic
University.  This university, the first stone of which was
laid on May 24, 1888, in the presence of Cardinal Gibbons, four
archbishops, twenty-one bishops and numerous eminent men,
among whom President Cleveland, has contributed to neo-
Scholastic literature numerous articles in a periodical publication,
the <i>Catholic University Bulletin.</i>  The most eminent contributors
have been Edward A. Pace, Edmund T. Shanahan and
William Turner (cf. Bibliography).<p>

Mr. Turner has also published valuable articles about the
Middle Ages in other reviews, such as the <i>American Catholic
Quarterly,</i> the <i>Philosophical Review</i> and the <i>New York
Review.</i>  His greatest title to the gratitude of all students of
philosophy is, however, his <i>History of Philosophy,</i> published in
1903.  This work has been greatly praised, and with justice.  It exposes with
a remarkable erudition the philosophical systems of ancient and
modern times.  More perfectly than any other similar work, it
condenses, in a few pages, the spirit and the doctrines of each
philosopher it studies.  Mr. Turner devotes a special attention
to the study of the, Middle Ages.  Of the 674 pages, which the
work contains, 185 are devoted to Scholastic philosophy.<p>

Mention must be made also of two important works written
as dissertations for the Doctor's degree.  The first of them is
<i>Religion and Morality,</i> written in 1899, at the Catholic
University, by James J. Fox.  The work, inspired by the purest
Thomistic ethical principles, strives to base upon history and reason
the thesis that religion and morality are necessarily connected.
The other work, <i>The Knowableness of God</i> (1905), written at
Notre Dame University by Matthew Schumacher, is one of the
most important contributions of neo-Scholasticism to the field
of Natural Theology.<p>
<p>

<b><a name="2">SECTION</a> 2. -- THE NEO-SCHOLASTIC REVIVAL IN CANADA</b><p>

The philosophy of St. Thomas Aquinas forms the basis of all
philosophical teaching in the Catholic institutions of Canada.<p>

A long time before the promulgation of the encyclical <i>Aeterni
Patris,</i> Thomism was already taught in the College of St. Hyacinth.
One of the professors of this college, Mgr. Desaulniers,
wrote a complete course of Scholastic philosophy, inspired by
St. Thomas and Liberatore, which has never been published.
The University of Ottawa, directed by the Oblate Fathers,
likewise follows the teachings of the Angelic Doctor.  It possesses
an Academy of St. Thomas in which a thesis, in harmony
with the Scholastic principles, is defended every week.<p>

The most important center of Thomism in Canada is, however,
the University Laval, in Quebec.  As early as 1879, this
University adopted Zigliara's <i>Summa Philosophica</i> as a text-
book in philosophy.  In 1884, the Faculty of Theology decided
to study St. Thomas in the <i>Summa Theologica</i> itself, which has
been, since that time, the manual of theology.<p>

The Thomistic movement in Canada has also given rise to a
few interesting works.  The first in date is the volume entitled,
<i>Philosophy of the Bible Vindicated</i> (1876), written by Cornelius
O'Brien.<p>

Cornelius O'Brien, born on May 4, 1843, in New Glasgow
(Prince Edward Island), educated at St. Dunstan's College
(Charlottetown), and at the Propaganda (Rome), ordained
priest in 1871, professor in St. Dunstan's College, orator, theologian,
novelist, poet, has occupied the archiepiscopal see of
Halifax from 1883 till his death, on March 9, 1906.<p>

His <i>"Philosophy of the Bible"</i> consists of three parts.  In
the first part, entitled <i>Natural Theology,</i> the author proves the
existence of a Supreme Being by the well-known Scholastic
arguments from a first cause, from the order of the world, and
from the universal consent of mankind.  He demonstrates that
this Supreme Being, or God, existing by necessity of nature, is
infinitely perfect, the creator and ruler of the physical world.<p>

In the second part, entitled <i>Psychology,</i> he proves the soul
to be simple, spiritual, immortal, endowed with free will, and
created immediately by God when it is to be infused into the
body.<p>

O'Brien differs from most modern defenders of Thomism with
regard to the origin of our ideas.  As he insists more than
Scholastics usually do, upon the activity essential to substances
and maintains not only that substance acts, but that whatever
acts is a substance,<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV17"><SUP>[17]</sup></a> he is led to the assertion that the soul is
et a force the very essence of which is that it should think,
understand, know, will,"<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV18"><SUP>[18]</sup></a> that it must therefore necessarily know its
own existence and something about happiness, and possess, by
the same fact, two ideas which are, if not innate, at least coeval
with the soul.<p>

The third part of the <i>Philosophy of the Bible</i> is devoted to
the study of certain questions which have an intimate connection
with ontology and have not been studied in the two preceding
parts:  space and time, certitude, religion, revelation, the
relation of faith and reason, etc.<p>

O'Brien is an enthusiastic admirer of Mediaeval philosophy.
He is convinced that many, "professors who are now extolled as
prodigies of learning would, had their lot been cast in the oft-
reviled middle ages, have been considered noisy school-boys."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV19"><SUP>[19]</sup></a><p>

In harmony with the Scholastic principle of the unity of
truth, he maintains that there can be but one true system of
philosophy, and goes even farther than most of the early neo-
Scholastics in his contemptuous disrespect for modern thinking.<p>

"Let it be understood from the outset," says he, "that we deny
the title of Philosopher to the founders of schools of error. . . .
The man who, as a general rule, blunders in the art he professes
to follow, is not called a tradesman, but a botcher; why, then,
call meaningless scribblers Philosophers?  They are literari
fungi."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV20"><SUP>[20]</sup></a><p>

And if we wish to know more definitely who those "meaningless
scribblers" are, we shall perhaps be astonished to find
among them:<p>

"Philosophic quacks, such as Hegel, Kant, Darwin, and <i>id
genus omne</i>;<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV21"><SUP>[21]</sup></a><p>

"Spinoza, who gave such a proof of mental aberration that
a school-boy who would be guilty of similar contradictions, would
most surely be doomed to lose his first holiday, and obliged to
write five hundred times:  <i>Idem non potest simul esse et non
esse;</i><A HREF="perrierg.html#XV22"><SUP>[22]</sup></a><p>

"The disciples of the transcendental German school, who,
lulled into a semi-somniferous state, by lager beer and strong
cigars, talk misty things which they call transcendental."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XV23"><SUP>[23]</sup></a><p>

Louis A. Paquet, actual president of the University Laval,
published, in 1888, in the review <i>Canada francais,</i> of Quebec,
an important article, entitled:  <i>Rosmini et son syst&egrave;me,</i> in which
he refutes the Rosminian doctrines by the principles of Scholastic
philosophy.<p>

A few years later, Mgr. Paquet published the first volumes
of the work upon which his fame chiefly rests, his <i>Disputationes
theologiae,</i> which form a learned commentary on St. Thomas's
<i>Summa Theologica.</i>  The first edition of the work was published
in Quebec between the years 1893 and 1903. A second
edition is now being made at Rome.<p>

Mention must also be made of Brother Symphorien-Louis, of
the Christian Schools, who published in Montreal, in 1905, a
text-book on Scholastic metaphysics (<i>Pr&eacute;cis de M&eacute;taphysique</i>).
Among the recent defenders of Thomism in Canada, no one
perhaps has served the Scholastic cause with a greater distinction
than Alexander MacDonald, actual Vicar General of Antigonish
and rector of St. Andrews (Nova Scotia).<p>

Born in S. W. Mahon, Cape Breton, on February 18, 1858,
Mr. MacDonald studied at St. Francis Xavier College (Antigonish)
and at the Propaganda, in Rome, where he was the
disciple of the famous Cardinal Satolli.  After being ordained,
in 1884, he taught philosophy for nineteen years in St. Francis
Xavier College.  During this time he showed himself a valiant
champion of the Scholastic principles in numerous articles,
which appeared in the <i>Casket,</i> of Antigonish, or in other
periodical publications (cf. Bibliography).  Mr. MacDonald is also
the author of several important works in theology, such as <i>The
Sacrifice of the Mass</i> (New York, 1905), <i>The Sacraments</i> (New
York, 1906), with which this essay is not directly concerned.
