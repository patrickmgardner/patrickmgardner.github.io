The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter XII: The Neo-Scholastic Revival in France</h1><hr><p>

Although France contributed perhaps more than any other
nation to turn the attention of the world to the Middle Ages,
the direct current of the Thomistic revival had at first little or
no influence upon French speculation.  The philosophical systems
of Descartes and Cousin were deeply rooted upon the
French soil.  Even in Catholic seminaries, the doctrines of the
two great French philosophers were officially taught.  The text-
book most in use at the time, and whose pages breathe a strong
Cartesian spirit, had been written by Father Valla in the last
years of the preceding century, and was generally known as
<i>Philosophie de Lyon.</i>  The full title of the work is:
<i>Institutiones philosophicae, auctoritate D.D. Archiepiscopi
Lugdunensis, 1792.</i>  Even after the promulgation of the encyclical
<i>Aeterni Patris,</i> eclecticism and Cartesianism kept their ground for a
long time among French Catholics.  This easily explains how
France had not a single great representative of neo-Scholaiticism
at the time Germany could mention with pride the works of
Kleutgen; Spain, those of Cardinal Gonzalez; Italy, those of
Sanseverino, Liberatore and Talamo.<p>

The works published in France in defense of Scholasticism
previous to the encyclical <i>AEterni Patris</i> are few and of little
importance.  Let us mention the <i>Prima Principia Scientiarum</i>
of Michael Rosset (1866); the <i>Breviarium Philosophiae
Scholasticae</i> of Grandelaude (1868); the short treatise entitled,
<i>De l'union substantielle de l'&acirc;me et du corps,</i> published in 1870 by
Henri Sauv&eacute;, president of the Catholic University of Angers;
the <i>Doctrine de la Connaissance,</i> of Mgr. Bourquard, of the
same university, published seven years later; and the treatise
<i>De intellectualismo</i> of the Sulpician P.M. Brin (1843-1894),
which has served as a basis to Farges and Barbedette for the
Manual of Scholastic philosophy they have recently written
(<i>Philosophia scholastics ad mentem Sancti Thomae, Aquinatis
exposita</i>).<p>

These modest efforts did not fall upon a barren ground.  The
work of the first pioneers was completed by eminent followers,
so that to-day France is second to no other nation in the number
and worth of the productions wherewith neo-Scholastic literature
has been enriched.<p>

As early as 1875, Count Domet de Verges wrote his M&eacute;taphysique
en pr&eacute;sence des sciences, a small work in which the
eminent author already evinces a tendency which characterizes
his subsequent writings, namely the attempt to show the harmony
existing between Aristotelian metaphysics and scientific
results.<p>

Mr. Domet de Vorges is one of the most distinguished representatives
of neo-Scholasticism in France.  For more than
thirty years he has defended, with unflagging energy, the great
cause of which, so early in life, he proclaimed himself a champion.
In union with Mgr. d'Hulst, he founded the Parisian
Society of St. Thomas.  He has published many important
works, and has been one of the most assiduous collaborators of
some Catholic reviews, especially of the <i>Annales de Philosophie
chr&eacute;tienne</i> and the <i>Revue de Philosophie.</i>  His most valuable
productions are his <i>Essai de M&eacute;taphysique positive</i> (1883), in
which he professes that Aristotelian metaphysics is a true science,
and, like all other sciences, is founded upon the facts of
experience; and his <i>Abr&eacute;g&eacute; de M&eacute;taphysique</i> (1906), especially
interesting for the method it follows.  For each problem, Mr.
de Vorges brings all solutions proposed by Mediaeval philosophers.
After a learned comparison and discussion, he gives his
preference to one of them or proposes a solution of his own.
This historical method cannot be too much praised.  It brings
before our eyes the whole body of Scholastic philosophy.  It
makes us enter into the very spirit of the Middle Ages.<p>

Among the early defenders of neo-Thomism in France, we
must also mention the Sulpician P. Vallet.  His <i>Praelectiones
Philosophie ad mentem S. Thomae Aquinatis,</i> published in 1879,
has been translated into several languages and honored by
numerous editions.  Mr. Vallet has also written numerous
shorter treatises (cf. Bibliography), which have assured him a
conspicuous rank among French neo-Scholastics.  As a philosopher
he is, however, greatly surpassed by another Sulpician,
Mr. Albert Farges.<p>

Farge's greatest contribution to neo-Scholastic literature
consists of a series of works published under the title of <i>Etudes
Philosophiques</i>.  The series comprises the following treatises:
I, <i>Th&eacute;orie fondamentale de l'acte et de la puissance, du moteur
et du mobile;</i> II, <i>Mati&eacute;re et Forme en pr&eacute;sence des sciences
modernes;</i> III, <i>La vie et l'evolution des esp&egrave;ces;</i> IV, <i>Le
cerveau, l'&acirc;me et les facult&eacute;s;</i> V, <i>L'objectivit&eacute; de la
perception des sens externes et les theories modernes;</i> VI,
<i>L'id&eacute;e de continu dans l'espace et dans le temps;</i> VII, <i>L'id&eacute;e
de Dieu d'apr&egrave;s la raison et la science;</i> VIII, <i>La libert&eacute; et le
devoir;</i> IX, <i>La crise de la certitude.</i><p>

In these works Mr. Farges expounds and defends the fundamental
principles of Scholastic philosophy.  He does not fear
to put Mediaeval theories in close contact with the most recent
scientific discoveries.  He finds in natural science the proof of
the doctrine of Matter and Form.  His conclusions as regards
the constitution of bodies have been discussed in our chapter on
Cosmology.  Although some of them are evidently inadmissible,
Mr. Farges cannot be denied a high rank among neo-Scholastics.
One of his admirers, William Garcia, goes so far as to give him
the very first place.<p>

A third Sulpician, G. Bulliat, less known than Vallet and
Farges, has lately published a <i>Thesaurus Philosophiae Thomisticae</i>
(1899), in which all philosophical doctrines scattered in
the works of St. Thomas are brought together. The work exclusively
consists of extracts from the writings of the Angelic
Doctor.<p>

The man who could dispute with Farges the first place among
French neo-Scholastics is Mr. Elie Blanc, professor of philosophy
in the Catholic University of Lyon.<p>

Elie Blanc is a writer of remarkable fecundity.  Having completed
a few years ago his <i>Dictionnaire universel de la pens&eacute;e,</i>
a masterly work, which may be described as a natural and philosophical
classification of words, ideas and things, he undertook
an immense Encyclopedia, which, when completed, will be one
of the most imposing monuments of the French language.  This
work, whose title is:  <i>Syst&egrave;mes des connaissances humaines</i>.
<i>Encyclop&eacute;die chr&eacute;tienne et fran&ccedil;aise du XX. si&egrave;cle,</i> will consist
of one hundred volumes octavo.  The first fifty will treat of the
different branches of human knowledge; the next twenty will be
devoted to geography; the last thirty to history.<p>

Among Mr. Blanc's numerous productions the following are
most especially devoted to philosophy:<p>

<i>Trait&eacute; de la Philosophie scolastique,</i> published in 1889, and
recently translated into Latin with the title, <i>Manuale Philosophiae
Scholasticae</i>.<p>

<i>Histoire de la Philosophie et particuli&egrave;rement de la Philosophie
contemporaine,</i> very valuable for the indications it contains
about contemporary philosophers.<p>

<i>Dictionnaire de Philosophie ancienne, moderne et contemporaine</i>
(1906).<p>

<i>Opuscules philosophiques,</i> containing studies about the
philosophy of Vacherot, the Ethics of Spencer, the question of free
will, etc.<p>

<i>M&eacute;langes philosophiques,</i> essays first published in <i>l'Univers
Catholique</i> between the years 1897 and 1900, and in which the
author clearly follows the movement of modern thought.<p>

Mr. Blanc also wrote, with the collaboration of Mr. Vaganay,
a Bibliography of the works recently published in French and
Latin.  Finally, he founded in 1903 an important review, <i>la
Pens&eacute;e contemporaine,</i> which has already given many interesting
articles in defense of the principles of Scholasticism.<p>

Blanc, Farges and Domet de Vorges, with the Jesuits Delmas
and De R&eacute;gnon, of whom more in the sequel, are the most distinguished
representatives of neo-Scholasticism in France.  Of
equal or scarcer inferior merit are Gardair, the Marist Peillaube,
and the Dominicans Coconnier, Sertillanges, Maumus and
Mandonnet.<p>

Mr. J. Gardair opened in the Sorbonne in 1890 a free course
on the philosophy of St. Thomas.  His lectures have been subsequently
published with the following titles:  <i>Corps et Ame</i>
(1892); <i> Les Passions et la Volont&eacute;</i> (1892); <i>La
Connaissance</i> (1895); </i>La Nature humaine</i> (1896); and form a
complete course of Scholastic philosophy.  The author closely follows the
teaching of St. Thomas Aquinas, and adheres to the doctrine of
the Angelic Doctor even in some points in which this doctrine
has been commonly abandoned.  He defends, for example, the
Thomistic view that the human fetus passes through a series
of stages in which it is successively informed by the vegetative,
the sensitive and the intellectual soul.<A HREF="perrierg.html#XII1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a>  Like Mr. Farges, Mr.
Gardair has purposely neglected many unimportant points, and
devoted his attention to the most essential Scholastic doctrines.<p>

The Marist Peillaube is a Thomist of the new school, and,
like Farges and the professors of Louvain, does not hesitate to
study the Thomistic principles side by side with the most recent
philosophical theories.  This position was already taken in his
<i>Th&eacute;orie des concepts,</i> a thesis he defended before the Catholic
University of Toulouse in 1895 for the degree of Doctor of
Philosophy.  It has been adhered to in the <i>Revue de Philosophie,</i>
published by Mr. Peillaube since 1900, and justly regarded
as one of the best philosophical reviews we possess to-day.<p>

Two other Marists of great merit are Bulliot, of whom Peillaube
has been the disciple, and Ragey, the author of remarkable
works on St. Anselm.<p>

The Dominican order has furnished to the cause of neo-
Scholasticism some of its most valiant defenders.  St. Thomas
Aquinas was a Dominican and has always been a favorite author
in Dominican studies.  The Dominicans are proud of their great
saint, and regard themselves -- probably with justice -- as his most
faithful interpreters.  We have already studied the works of
Zigliara in Italy and of Gonzalez in Spain.<p>

In France the Dominicans have done immense service to the
cause of neo-Scholasticism by the publication of the <i>Revue
thomiste,</i> founded in Paris in 1893.  The <i>Revue thomiste</i>
studies theology side by side with philosophy, and contains interesting
dissertations about the true meaning of the Angelic Doctor.
It is regarded by Mr. Picavet as the most important periodical
publication of neo-Scholastic literature.<p>

The Dominican Coconnier is chiefly known for his work
<i>l'Hypnotisme franc</i> (1897), in which he attacks the ideas
expressed by the Italian Jesuit Franco in another work written
on the same subject some years before (</i>l'Ipnotismo tornato di
modo,</i> 1886).  Fr.  Coconnier excludes from "frank hypnotism"
all facts of immediate transmission of ideas, telepathy,
intuition of the thoughts of other people, vision of the future,
etc.  He then teaches that hypnotism thus understood is not
necessarily supernatural.<p>

Besides this work, with which Scholastic philosophy is not
directly concerned, Coconnier has published a treatise on the
human soul (1890), in which he studies modern psychological
theories.<p>

A. D. Sertillanges has chiefly discussed the problem of God.
For many years he has been as assiduous collaborator of several
philosophical reviews, such as the <i>Revue thomiste</i> and the
<i>Revue des sciences philosophiques et th&eacute;ologiques,</i> and has proved
himself to be one of the most profonnd interpreters of the Angelic
Doctor.<p>

V. Maumus, in <i>Saint Thomas d'Aquin et la Philosophie
cart&eacute;sienne,</i> has made a comparative study of the Cartesian and
Thomistic philosophy, in which he naturally prefers, St. Thomas.
One year later, in <i>Les Philosophes contemporains,</i> he has judged
very severely Vacherot, Taine, Janet, Caro and Schopenhauer.
He is especially antipathetic to Schopenhauer, whom he charges
with having dishonored the history of philosophy.<p>

Pierre Mandonnet owes a well-deserved reputation to the
work, <i>Siger de Brabant et l'Averroisme latin au XIII. si&egrave;cle,</i>
which contains very important data about the great currents of
thought of the thirteenth century, and has been greatly praised
by Delacroix, in the <i>Revue de Synth&egrave;se historique</i> (August,
1902), and by Gomez Izquierdo, in his <i>History of Philosophy in
the XIX. century.</i>  Mandonnet has made on Mediaeval topics
other important studies, which have appeared in the <i>Revue
thomiste.</i>  Let us mention the essay entitled, <i>Jean Scot Erig&egrave;ne
et Jean le Sourd,</i> published in 1897.<p>

Other Dominicans worthy of notice are:  Hugon, who has
recently (1906-7) published the first two volumes of a course
of Scholastic philosophy; De Munnynck, who has refuted the
objections raised against moral liberty from the theory of
conservation of energy; Gardeil, who has written interesting
articles on neo-Scotism; Berthier, Montagne, Folghera, etc.<p>

The two greatest works with which the French Jesuits have
enriched neo-Scholastic literature are:  the <i>M&eacute;taphysique des
Causes</i> of Fr. de R&eacute;gnon and the <i>Ontologia</i> of Fr. Delmas.<p>

Born in Saint-Herblain (Loire Inf&eacute;rieure) on October 11,
1832, Th&eacute;odore de R&eacute;gnon entered the Society of Jesus in 1852.
He taught mathematics and physical science in the College of
the Immaculate Conception and in the school of Sainte-Genevieve
(Paris), and died in Vaugirard on December 26, 1893.<p>

During the time he was engaged in teaching, he carefully
studied the great Scholastic doctors, so that, when the laws of
1880 separated him from his chair, he was in possession of
important materials which allowed him to complete in a short
time considerable philosophical and theological works.<p>

The most important of De R&eacute;gnon's philosophical productions
is his <i>M&eacute;taphysique des Causes.</i><p>

The aim of the author is very modest.  He simply wishes to
lay before the students of St. Thomas the philosophical notions
without which a thorough understanding of the Angelic Doctor
cannot be attained:  "To make clear the nation of cause by
separating it from adjacent notions, to show how the influence
of the cause expands into distinct causalities, to explain the
nature of these different causalities and their correlation; finally,
to show unity and harmony in the action of these different
causes:  such is my aim.  It is a rational plan to contain the
great maxims concerning causes, which constantly recur in the
treatises of our doctors.  It is a preparatory study which may
be useful to those who wish to understand St. Thomas in St.
Thomas himself."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XII2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a><p>

With what perfection Fr. de R&eacute;gnon has carried out the plan
thus sketched in his Introduction may be gathered from the
eulogistic testimonials of several eminent philosophers.  Oll&eacute;-
Laprune, while teaching at the <i>Ecole Normale Sup&eacute;rieure,</i> would
often direct his students to the <i>M&eacute;taphysique des Causes</i> as to a
masterpiece.  Georges Fonsegrive, in his <i>Cours de Philosophie,</i>
pronounces De R&eacute;gnon's work learned and profound.<A HREF="perrierg.html#XII3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a>  Bishop
Maurice d'Hulst calls the distinguished Jesuit "un m&eacute;taphysicien
de premier ordre."<A HREF="perrierg.html#XII4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a><p>

Charles Delmas published in 1896 an extensive treatise on
Scholastic metaphysics, entitled <i>Ontologia Metaphysica
generalis.</i>  All questions concerning ontology are treated with the
greatest minuteness.  The author follows St. Thomas, Suarez
and modern Scholastics, especially those belonging to the Society
of Jesus.  Fr. Delmas sides with Suarez rather than with St.
Thomas whenever a divergence exists between the two great doctors.
He thus maintains with Suarez that the distinction between
the essence and the existence of created beings is not real,
but virtual.<A HREF="perrierg.html#XII5"><SUP>[5]</sup></a>  It is perhaps on account of this preference that
the Ontologia has been described as a <i>summula Suarezii.</i>  Fr.
Delmas's work is not, however, a mere compendium of Suarez's
<i>Metaphysica.</i>  It studies the doctrines of Kant, Locke, Hume,
and other modern philosophers.  These considerations about
modern systems are probably the weakest part of Delmas's work.
I doubt whether any student of Kant would recognize the philosophy
of the Critique as portrayed in the pages 19-22 of the
<i>Ontologia.</i><p>

Among other writers who have served with distinction the
cause of neo-Scholasticism in France let us mention:<p>

Jules Didiet (1840-1903), who has taught for twenty-five
years in the Catholic University of Lille.  His most important
contribution to philosophy is:  <i>Contribution philosophique &agrave;
l'&eacute;tude des sciences</i> (1902).  He has also made, in the volume
entitled <i>Un Si&egrave;cle,</i> a rapid survey of the philosophical movement
of the world during the nineteenth century.<p>

J. M. A. Vacant (1851-1901), professor in the seminary of
Nancy.  Vacant, although primarily a theologian, has written
numerous works or essays concerning philosophy (cf. Bibliography).
Most important among them are his comparative
studies of the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus.<p>

Prosper de Martign&eacute;, a member of the Franciscan order,
famous by a work entitled, <i>La Scolastique et les traditions
franciscaines,</i> in which he studies Alexander of Hales, St.
Bonaventure, Richard of Middletown and Duns Scotus.<p>

A. Clerval, of the diocesis of Chartres, author of remarkable
researches about the school of Chartres in the Middle Ages.<p>

Cl&eacute;ment Besse, professor in the <i>Institut Catholique de Paris,</i>
who, besides valuable articles published in the Revue Neo-
Scolastique and dealing with morality in France, and the volume,
<i>Philosophie et Philosophes,</i> has recently written a historical
study entitled:  <i>Deux centres du mouvement thomiste, Rome et
Louvain</i> (1902).  Mr. Besse has been reproached with having
been unduly severe for Roman neo-Thomism.  The characteristic
traits of the two great neo-Scholastic schools are, however,
faithfully delineated in his work.  The chief merit of <i>Deux
centres du mouvement thomiste</i> is the historical data it contains
about early Roman Thomism, which have been of great service
to all subsequent historians of the neo-Scholastic movement.<p>

Carra de Vaux, professor at the <i>Institut Catholique de Paris,</i>
who has published interesting studies about Arabian philosophers.<p>

Victor Bernies, author of the work, <i>Spiritualit&eacute; et Immortalit&eacute;</i>
(1901), which has met with great success, and of a series
of articles on the "active intellect," whose existence he has
denied.<p>

P. Mielle, professor of philosophy in the seminary of Langres,
who published in 1894 a dissertation entitled, <i>De substantiae
corporalis vi et ratione,</i> greatly praised by Picavet;<A HREF="perrierg.html#XII6"><SUP>[6]</sup></a> and, more
recently (1898), the treatise, <i>La Mati&egrave;re premi&egrave;re et l'&eacute;tendue,</i>
in which he expounds and discusses the opinions of the great
Scholastic philosophers about primordial matter, and agrees with
Thomas Aquinas in regarding it as the principle of individuation
of the bodily substance.<p>

Some French writers of great merit, although less strictly
Scholastic than those we have studied, have defended the essential
principles of Thomistic philosophy.  Most distinguished
among them are Mgr. d'Hulst, Clodius Piat and Georges
Fonsegrive.<p>

Maurice d'Hulst (1841-1896), successor of Monsabr&eacute; in
Notre-Dame and first rector of the Catholic University of Paris,
is primarily an orator.  He has served the cause of neo-Scholasticism
by a series of articles which he has later collected and
published in the volume <i>M&eacute;langes philosophiques.</i> The volume
contains:  three opening lessons of a free course of philosophy
given from 1880 to 1883, three series of lectures given to the
public, and articles published in the <i>Correspondant</i> and the
<i>Annales de Philosophie chr&eacute;tienne.</i><p>

Clodius Piat, professor at the <i>Institut Catholique of Paris,</i>
was first known for a memoir on the active intellect, written in
1891, which he published, with greater development, in 1896,
and entitled <i>l'Id&eacute;e.</i>  In this work Mr. Piat examines and
criticizes empiricism, ontologism, and the theory of innate ideas, and
insists upon the essential distinction between the idea and the
phantasm.  In <i>La Libert&eacute;</i> (1894-95) he discusses all modern
theories about freedom, and defends the freedom of the will on
the grounds of the direct testimony of consciousness and of the
moral law. Besides these two great works and two others of no
less interest:  <i>la Personne humaine</i> (1897) and <i>Destin&eacute;e de
l'homme</i> (1898), Mr. Piat has contributed numerous articles to
several philosophical reviews, and the volume <i>Socrate</i> (1900) to
the collection <i>S&eacute;rie des grands philosophes.</i>  He is one of the
most distinguished Catholic philosophers of the present day.<p>

Georges Fonsegrive is one of the most conspicuous among
French publicists.  He founded in 1896 the review <i>La Quinzaine,</i>
which has actively served for eleven years (till March,
1907) the cause of Catholicism.  Mr. Fonsegrive has defended
the fundamental Scholastic principles in his <i>Essai sur le libre
arbitre</i> (1887), crowned by the Academy of Moral and Political
Science, and in a second treatise, <i>La Causalit&eacute; efficiente</i> (1893),
in which he exposes the origin of the idea of efficient cause and
defends its validity.<p>

It would be unjust not to mention here Mr. Francois Picavet,
born in Petit-Fayt (Nord) in 1851, and actually professor in
the department of <i>Hautes-Etudes</i> at the Sorbonne.  A primary
school teacher at first, Mr. Picavet has risen, through his own
merit, to the high place he now occupies in the educational field.
His contributions to philosophy are numerous and display the
greatest erudition.  Of special interest are his studies on
Scholasticism.  They consist of articles published in the <i>Revue
Philosophique,</i> of learned monographs on Gerbert, Abelard, and
other Mediaeval writers, and of a more extensive work, the
<i>Esquisse d'une histoire g&eacute;n&eacute;rale et compar&eacute;e des philosophies
m&eacute;di&eacute;vales,</i> which has met with a great success, and of which
we have already spoken.  Mr. Picavet does not study Scholastic
philosophy with the spirit which has inspired the neo-Thomistic
revival.  He is not, and does not pretend to be a Scholastic.
He has nevertheless contributed more than any other writer to
impose the neo-Scholastic revival upon the attention of French
philosophers.<p>

We have mentioned the reviews <i>Revue thomiste, Revue de
Philosophie</i> and <i>La Pens&eacute;e contemporaine.</i>  Neo-Scholasticism
owes also some gratitude to the <i>Annales de Philosophie
chr&eacute;tienne,</i> which was the first organ of the Thomistic revival.  The
<i>Annales</i> has recently modified its direction and manifested a
marked sympathy for the Kantian philosophy.
