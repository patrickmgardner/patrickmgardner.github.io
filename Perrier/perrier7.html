The Revival of Scholastic Philosophy in the Nineteenth Century</a><hr>
<h1>Chapter VII: Scholastic Moral Philosophy</h1><hr><p>

According to Mr. De Wulf, the essential characteristics of
the Scholastic system of ethics may be reduced to two heads:  it
is eudemonistic and libertarian.<p>

In order to form a clear conception of the nature of this
eudemonism, a few considerations about the necessary conditions
underlying the activity of all beings will not be out of place
here.<p>

Waiving all other considerations, it must be admitted that all
agents act for a definite end.  This is true not only of conscious
beings, but likewise of inanimate objects.  It follows as a necessary
consequence from the fact that our cosmos presents us with
distinct individuals, each of which is endowed with a peculiar
nature.  When dynamite blows up an edifice, it acts towards
an end as well as the acorn when it becomes an oak.  Like the
acorn, it possesses an essential character, definite potentialities
which, under proper conditions, will forcibly become actual.
The only difference that exists between the potentiality of the
inorganic and of the organic world lies in the fact that inorganic
agents do not possess any principle of self-actuation, and therefore
they do not act except when moved by some external cause.
Organic beings, on the other hand, are endowed with an inner
principle of self-determination.  It is in this very principle that
the essence of life consists:  "The living being," says St.
Thomas, "is the one that can move itself," <i>"Vita est substantia
cui convenit secundum naturam suam movere seipsam."</i><A HREF="perrierg.html#VII1"><SUP>[1]</sup></a><p>

Plants, however, although self-determined, are not conscious
of the end toward which their own nature compels them to tend.
They are thus inferior to sentient beings, whose essential
characteristic is a more or less clear consciousness of their own peculiar
activities.  Man alone possesses an intellectual knowledge of his
end, because he is the only being endowed with reason and capabile
of forming universal concepts.  He alone properly knows
his end and can adopt the most suitable means to reach it.  He
alone is a moral being.<p>

Ends may be divided into proximate and ultimate.  Proximate
ends are those that are not desired for themselves; but only
in so far as they are steps towards the attaining of ultimate
ends.  Strictly speaking, they are not ends, but means.  Ultimate
ends are desired for their own sake and therefore they are
not subservient to anything else.  If we consider health as the
ultimate end a sick man has in view -- an end which cannot be
ultimate for him in so far as he is a man, but only in so far
as he is a sick man -- the acquiring of the remedies which he is
obliged to take in order to get rid of his disease will be a proximate
end.<p>

Proximate ends being thus properly means, an infinite series
of such ends becomes absurd, and we must admit that rational
beings not only act for an end, but for an ultimate end.<p>

The great question of morality consists therefore in the determination
of the ultimate end of man.  All actions subservient
to this end will be good; all actions inconsistent with this end
will be bad.  Now, if this world of ours is rational, we must
admit that the end of all beings is true to their nature.  It can,
not be but the actualization of the potentialities they contain,
the unfolding of the latent perfectious which constitute their
very essence.<p>

This most important truth has been relegated to oblivion by
all that put the foundation of morality on a mere external
principle.<p>

Whether we build our ethical system upon the common consent
of mankind, as Saint Lambert did, or upon the civil law,
as Hobbes, or upon the will of God, as Crusius, we remove
rationality from our world, and, by so doing, we destroy morality
itself.  All external systems of ethics imply that no action
is good or bad in itself; that an act we now regard as good would
be bad if some determinate free agent had willed it so; might
become bad this very day if the will or the caprice of the lawgiver
should vary.  Under such conditions no science of ethics
is possible.<p>

The end of man is thus the complete actualization of his
nature -- or to use a term current in ancient Greece -- perfect
happiness.<p>

Here Scholastic ethics meets a powerful adversary which,
under a variety of forms, has controlled modern thought, has
assumed different garbs according to the varying circumstances,
and, repeatedly unmasked, has appeared again and again, its
appearance being the signal for prolonged applause; a system
which, under the specious names of hedonism, Epicurianism,
utilitarianism, is to-day perhaps more vigorous than ever and
prides itself upon its able defenders and legions of adherents.<p>

The difference between hedonism and Scholasticism lies in
this:  Hedonism inculcates that pleasure is the ultimate criterion
of morality, and that an action is good only in so far as it is
pleasurable; whereas for Scholasticism goodness lies in the
nature of the act itself, and pleasure is simply an eftect which
mav follow from a moral act, which will necessarily accompany
the good in the long run, but which is not the good.<p>

As hedonists often allege the authority of Plato and Aristotle
in support of their theory, it will be worth while, before exposing
the prime defect of Hedonism, to quote a few passages which
clearly show that Plato and Aristotle did not confuse the pleasurable
with the good, and that furthermore they held, in regard
to the final end of man, the very beliefs that characterize the
ethical system of the Scholastics.<p>

The flrst passage is taken from Plato's Gorgias:<p>

"Listen to me, then, while I recapitulate the argument:  Is
the pleasant the same as the good?  Not the same.  Callicles
and I are agreed about that.  And is the pleasant to be pursued
for the sake of the good? or the good for the sake of the pleasant?
The pleasant is to be pursued for the sake of the good.
And that is the pleasant at the presence of which we are pleased,
and that is good at the presence of which we are good?  To be
sure.  And we are good, and all good things whatever are good
when some virtue is present in them?  That, Callicles, is my
conviction.  But the virtue of each thing whether body or soul,
instrument or creature, when given to them in the best way,
comes to them not by chance, but as the result of the order and
truth and art which are imparted to them.  Am I not right?
I maintain that I am. . . .  And is not the soul which has an
order of her own better than that which has no order of her
own?  Certainly.  And the soul which has an order is orderly?
Of course.  And that which is orderly is temperate?  Assuredly.
And the temperate soul is good?  No other answer can I give,
Callicles dear. . . .  If the temperate soul is the good soul, the
soul which is in the opposite condition, that is the foolish and
intemperate is the bad soul.<p>

"And will not the temperate man do what is proper, both in
relation to gods and men; for he would not be temperate if he
did not what is proper?  Yes, certainly.  And in his relation
to other men he will do what is just, and in his relation to the
gods he will do what is holy; and he who does what is just and
holy cannot be other than just and holy?  Very true.  And
he must be courageous, for the duty of a temperate man is not
to follow or to avoid what he ought not, but what be ought,
whether things, or men, or pleasures, or pains, and patiently to
endure what he ought; and therefore, Callicles, the temperate
man, being, as we have described, also just and courageous and
holy, cannot be other than a perfectly good man, nor can the
good man do otherwise than well and perfectly whatever be
does; and he who does well must of necessity be happy and
blessed, and the evil man who does evil miserable."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII2"><SUP>[2]</sup></a><p>

As we see, happiness is by no means identified with pleasure.
It consists in a certain virtue, in an order which characterizes
the soul of the good man.  The temperate soul is the good soul;
the foolish and intemperate is the bad soul.<p>

A similar doctrine is held by Aristotle.  In the first book of
his Nicomachean Ethics, he teaches that happiness is neither
pleasure, nor honor, nor wealth, but "an energy of the soul
according to virtue."  These are Aristotle's own words:<p>

"Men seem not unreasonably to form their notion of the
good, and of happiness, from observing the different lives which
men lead.  The many and most sordid class suppose it to be
pleasure, and therefore they are content with a life of enjoyment.<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII3"><SUP>[3]</sup></a><p>

"But, perhaps, to say that happiness is the greatest good,
appears like stating something which is already granted; and it
is desirable that we should explain still more clearly what it is.
Perhaps, then, this may be done, if we take the peculiar work of
man; for as to the musician, and statuary, and to every artist,
and in short to all who have any work or course of action, the
good and excellence of each appears to consist in their peculiar
work; so would it appear to be with man, if there is any peculiar
work belonging to him . . .<p>

"What, then, must this peculiar work be?  For life man
appears to share in common with plants; but his peculiar work
is the object of our inquiry:  we must, therefore, separate the
life of nutrition and growth.  Then a kind of sensitive life
would next follow; but this also he appears to enjoy in common
with the horse, the ox, and every animal.  There remains, therefore,
a certain practical life of a being which possesses reason;
and of this one part is, as it were, obedient to reason, the other
as possessing it, and exercising intellect.  But this life also
being spoken in two ways (according to energy and according
to habit), we must take that according to energy; for that
appears to be more properly so called.  Now if the work of
man, and of a good man, is the same generically, as in the case
of a harper, and a good harper (and so, in short, in all cases,
superiority in each particular excellence being added to each
particular work); for it is the work of a harper to play, of a
good harper to play well:  and if we assume the peculiar work
of man to be a kind of life, and this life an energy of the soul
and actions performed with reason; and the peculiar work of
a good man to be the same things done well, and honorably; and
everything to be complete according to its proper excellence:
if, I repeat, these things are true, it follows, that man's chief
good is "an energy of the soul according to virtue"; but if the
virtues are more than one, according to the best and most perfect
virtue; and besides this, we must add, in a perfect life:  for
as neither one swallow, nor one day, makes a spring; so neither
does one day, nor a short time, make a man blessed and
happy."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII4"><SUP>[4]</sup></a><p>

Let us now directly examine hedonism itself.<p>

In the first place, it sounds like a truism to say that the
words "good" and "pleasurable" cannot be unqualifiedly
taken as convertible terms.  The common belief of mankind
looks upon as good many actions that do not bring any real
pleasure to their authors.  The payment of a debt, charity to
the poor, self-sacrifice, are praised all over the world.  On the
other hand, many acts bringing great pleasure are universally
condemned.  The drunkard and the libertine are objects of
contempt to every right-thinking man.<p>

Hedonists meet this objection by saying that the pleasure
given as the basis of our conduct is not the particular pleasure
of the moment, but the pleasure in the long run.  The presently
expected satisfaction is a worthy motive of action only in so far
as it does not make impossible the attainment of a satisfaction
more remote.  Although in some particular cases, the pursuit of
a proximate satisfaction is not to be considered as inferior to
that of ultimate gratifications, it is none the less a fundamental
principle that the guidance by simple and immediate feelings
must be subordinated to the authority of higher and more complex
feelings.<p>

It cannot be denied that hedonism thus explained contains a
great deal of truth.  The egoistic element of all our acts must
be frankly recognized.  The poor workman who trods under
foot his inordinate thirst for intoxicating liquor in order that
his wife and children may have some bread to eat, relinquishes
an immediate good to obtain a more distant good, the welfare
and happiness of his family, and, as a consequence, his own
peace and joy at home.  The sister of charity, who leaves her
home and parents, who renounces forever the roost legitimate
joys of life, the pleasures that the matrimonial state and the
rearing of children would bring to her; who spends her days
and her nights at the bedside of a poor sick man whom she has
never met before, to whom she feels attached by no earthly
bonds, whom nevertheless she attends with all the painstaking
cares of a most devoted mother, whom she finally snatches from
the claws of death, expecting no earthly reward, knowing full
well that the only prize of her self-abnegation will be an untimely
death; this sister of charity, whose whole life seems to
be a glowing impersonation of altruism, is, from a hedonistic
point of view, just as selfish as the most vulgar man.  She
renounces the pleasures of this world to enjoy the pleasures of
the world to come.  She abandons relatives, riches, life itself,
all finite and perishable goods, to secure the possession of treasures
that never fade nor grow old.  The prize she covets is none
less than God himself.<p>

Pleasurable actions, however, can be made co-extensive with
good actions only in assuming there is a future life.  As many
hedonists would be loath to take such a life into account, would
rather profess with Hegel that this every-day world, what is here
and now, has been a very good exchange for the shadowy other-
world about which ancient philosophers worried themselves sick,
there will come in their way a great many facts which their
system -- in the form we are at present considering -- will be
unable to explain.  No future gratification, if we simply consider
this actual world of ours, can possibly accrue to the
soldier who, in a brave fight against the foes of his country,
dies the death of a hero on the battlefield.  If he is unknown
to the world, he will not even reach the glory of having his name
recorded in the annals of his country; he will not be held Lip to
the school-boys of future generations as the ideal citizen.
Obscure in life; still more obscure in death.  No man, however,
would call into question the intrinsic worth of his heroic death.<p>

Facts of this kind have caused the downfall of individual
hedonism and given birth to the celebrated formula, so universally
admitted by hedonists to-day:  "the greatest good for the
greatest number."  In this new form of the system, not only
must immediate satisfactions give way to satisfactions more
remote, but the present and the future pleasures of the individual
must be subordinated to the pleasures of the whole community.
All forms of self-sacrifice are thus easily justified.
The sister of charity will die in her prime of life at her post
of duty, but the hundreds of unfortunate people whom she has
rescued from death will live and society will be benefited.  The
hero will be killed on the battlefield, but his country will be
saved.<p>

Scholastic moralists would admit that pleasure and good are
co-extensive.  If good actions are those performed in harmony
with our nature, they must needs produce pleasurable results at
the present moment or at some future time.  We cannot deny
this principle without denying the rational character of our
world.  And as here below many deeds, universally regarded as
good, do not give rise to any pleasurable consequence, there
must exist a more perfect world, in which whatever seems irrational
in this will be rectified.  But, although pleasure and good
are co-extensive, they are far from being identical terms.  Pleasure
bears to good the relation of an effect to its cause.  A good
action will produce pleasurable results; but it will produce them
on account of its own inherent nature.  The goodness will
belong to the elements of the action itself, regardless of the
consequences that may possibly follow from it.  A ripe apple
will give rise to pleasant gustatory impressions, but those impressions
will be due to the peculiar nature and disposition of
the atoms of the apple itself, which will thus possess an intrinsic
goodness, independently of the sensations ii may produce.  And
if the apple decays, it is in the apple itself that a change from
good to bad will occur:  it will be bad even if nobody ever tastes
it.  What is true of an external object is likewise true of all
that belongs to the inner nature of man.  All our acts possess
a value of their own, which must be regarded as primary, while
the ensuing consequences are looked upon as only secondary.
The good is thus identifiable with what is in harmony with our
nature.  But as we are endowed with several orders of faculties,
as we are made up of body and soul, and thereby possess a
sensuous, and an intellectual appetite, the gratification of our
lower impulses must be subordinated to our nobler energies.
We must live according to our nature, but to our whole nature.
The satisfaction of a sensuous desire is thus good in itself, but
becomes bad if the exercise of a nobler faculty is thwarted
thereby:<p>

"Delectationes corporales," says St. Thomas, "sunt secundum
partem sensitivam, quae regulator ratione:  et ideo indigent temperari
et refraenari per rationem."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII5"><SUP>[5]</sup></a><p>

The assertion that the satisfaction of a sensuous desire is good
in itself puts Scholastic moralists in conflict with the author of
the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>.  According to Immanuel
Kant, a work is good when it is done, not only from duty, but
from pure duty.<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII6"><SUP>[6]</sup></a>  Whenever some natural impulse furnishes
the motive of a good deed, this deed is thereby deprived of its
moral worth.  Our actions must spring from duty alone, and
not from any natural inclination whatsoever:<p>

"To be beneficent when we can is a duty," says Kant, "and
besides this there are many minds so sympathetically constituted
that, without any other motive of vanity or self-interest, they
find a pleasure in spreading joy around them, and can take
delight in the satisfaction of others so far as it is their own
work.  But I maintain that in such a case, an action of this
kind, however proper, however amiable it may be, has nevertheless
no true moral worth, but is on a level with other inclinations,
<i>e. g.,</i> the inclination to honor, which, if it is happily
directed to that which is in fact of public utility and accordant
with duty, and consequently honorable, deserves praise and
encouragement, but not esteem.  For the maxim lacks the moral
import, namely, that such actions be done from duty, not from
inclination."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII7"><SUP>[7]</sup></a><p>

Kant's system of morals, perfectly correct in so far as it recognizes
that moral actions must spring from our own individuality,
not from any external principle, correct also when it points out
the insufficiency of hedonism, fails to recognize the legitimacy
of our natural inclinations.  Inconsistent when he divides our
mind into two compartments, and sets the practical against the
pure reason, the solitary of Koenigsberg is guilty of a similar
inconsistency in his practical realm.  He splits up, as it were,
our intimate self, opposes one part to another, cherishes one
fragment as genuine and praiseworthy, rejects the other as
spurious and baneful.  He prostrates himself before the categorical
imperative, which indeed originates from the very depths
of our soul, is God himself speaking to our heart and making us
know our duties through the voice of our own nature; but, at
the same time, he condemns, as adequate moral motives, those
cravings, those natural aspirations which form, as well as the
voice of pure duty, a constituent part of our own selves.  His
system, repulsive to the ordinary man for its barrenness, incongruous
with the common beliefs of mankind in so far as it
deprives of moral worth not only the charity of the good-natured
man, but the sacrifice of the hero who dies for his country, is
inadmissible in the world of thought because it makes man a
mere bundle of contradictory elements.<p>

The second characteristic of Scholastic ethics is its libertarianism.<p>

The doctrine of free will has been so often misrepresented,
and rejected on that account, that a few explanatory remarks
will not be out of place here.  It is quite absurd to call a free
volition a causeless cause or a motiveless act.  Libertarians are
far from teaching that free actions are done without a motive:
they simply contend that the motive does not necessarily determine
our will.  Our will, they say, is a rational faculty whose
object is the good.  Now a good determines our will only if it
is good in every respect.  As long as there remains in it some
undesirable aspect -- as is the case with all the finite things of
this world -- our will has not what it naturally tends to, perfect
happiness, and is not therefore necessarily determined:<p>

"Si proponatur aliquod objectum voluntati, quod sit universaliter
bonum, et secundum omnem considerationem, ex necessitate
voluntas in illud tendit, si aliquid velit:  non enim poterit
velle oppositum:  si autem proponatur sibi aliquid objectum,
quod non secundum quamlibet considerationem sit bonum, non
ex necessitate voluntas fertur in illud."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII8"><SUP>[8]</sup></a><p>

The laborer who, after toiling laboriously for long hours every
day, brings his wife the fruit of his toil and fatigue instead of
spending it in a grog-shop, certainly acts with an end in view.
He is determined by a motive; but his own consciousness eloquently
testifies that this motive did not determine his will
necessarily, that he might have acted otherwise.<p>

Scholastics are unanimous in regarding free will, thus understood,
as an indispensable presupposition of all morality.  The
recognition of this truth does not belong solely to them.  Kant,
whose philosophy lies open to criticism in many other respects,
joins here in perfect harmony with the teachings of the School.
Free will has a conspicuous place in his system of ethics, is
indeed its corner-stone.  He regards it as an essential condition
of all true morality.<p>

If we start from fatalistic principles, if we regard all our acts
as necessarily determined by our character and surroundings, all
possibility of acting differently from what we did disappears,
and the words merit and demerit lose all their significance.<p>

It will perhaps seem strange that a philosophy professing to
be a revival of Thomism should defend any thesis of free will.
Many non-Catholic writers, indeed, look upon St. Thomas as an
angry determinist.  We will limit ourselves to two quotations:<p>

"In the first place," says Fullerton, "it may help one to realize
how erroneous is the current notion that this doctrine (of free
will) has some natural connection with religion and good morals,
and that they may be expected to be found in conjunction.
When Stoic and Epicurean are placed in contrast, it is certainly
not to the advantage of the latter.  And surely no man can
regard Augustine as less religious than Pelagius, St. Thomas as
less religious than Duns Scotus, Luther as less religious than
Erasmus, and Jansenius as less religious than his Jesuit opponents.
A glance at the history of human thought tempts one
to maintain that men of strong religious feeling are less likely
to become "free-willists" than other men.  Their peculiar danger
appears to be a lapse into some sort of fatalism."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII9"><SUP>[9]</sup></a><p>

Our second quotation will be taken from the Swiss philosopher,
Charles S&eacute;cr&eacute;tan:<p>

"Il (St. Thomas) attribue la coulpe au libre arbitre de la
volont&eacute;:  'Hoc enim imputatur alicui in culpam, quum deficit
a perfecta actione cujus dominus est secundum voluntatem. . . .
Deus est auctor mali paenae, non autem mali culpae.'  Ces d&eacute;clarations
semblent pr&eacute;cises, mais elles ne sauraient tenir devant
le d&eacute;terminisme absolu qui forme la base de tout le syst&egrave;me."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII10"><SUP>[10]</sup></a><p>

And a little further on he continues:<p>

"Le libre arbitre n'est, aux yeux du dernier P&egrave;re de l'Eglise,
que la facult&eacute; de s'&eacute;carter de la raison.  Il n'est donc pas question
de libre arbitre en Dieu."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII11"><SUP>[11]</sup></a><p>

S&eacute;cr&eacute;tan, however, does not feel perfectly at ease.  He feels
no doubt about St. Thomas's strict determinism.  Nevertheless,
he is compelled to recognize, in the works of the Angelic Doctor,
some teachings sounding very much like an admission of free
will.  He concludes that a contradiction permeates the whole
system:<p>

"En contradiction flagrante avec son d&eacute;terminisme, avec son
optimisme absolu, avec ses doctrines sur l'&eacute;tendue de la causalit&eacute;
divine et sur la prescience de tous les futurs, Thomas professe
cat&eacute;goriquement le libre arbitre."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII12"><SUP>[12]</sup></a><p>

Let us now turn to the works of St. Thomas himself and see
whether he would accept as his the doctrines thus imputed to
him.  We shall confine ourselves to a few striking passages, and
refer those who should desire more abundant information to the
<i>Summa Theologica,</i> the <i>Summa contra Gentiles</i> and the
<i>Opuscula</i>, of which a thorough study is necessary for a complete
understanding of the philosophy of St. Thomas, and in which
the point which interests us at present is repeatedly and adequately
discussed.<p>

In the <i>Summa contra Gentiles,</i> St. Thomas teaches that all
intellectual substances are endowed with free will:<p>

"Caput XLVIIL. -- Quod substantiae intellectuales sunt liberi
arbitrii in agendo.  Ex his autem apparet, quod praedictae substantiae
sunt liberi arbitrii in agendo.  quod enim arbitrio agant,
manifestum est eo quod per cognitionem intellectivam judicium
habent de operandis. libertatem autem necesse est eas habere,
si babent dominium sui actus, ut ostensum est (c. 47).  Sunt
igitur praedictae substantiae liberi arbitrii in agendo."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII13"><SUP>[13]</sup></a><p>

He gives his view on Divine Providence, and professes that
it does not interfere with the free will of man:<p>

"Caput LXXIlI. -- Quod divina providentia non excludit
arbitrii libertatem.  Ex quo patet quod providentia divina voluntatis
libertati non repugnat. . . . Per gubernationem cujuscumque
providentis, res gubernatae deducuntur ad finem convenientem;
unde et de providentia divina Gregorius Nyssenus
dicit (De philos., 1. 8, c. 2) quod est 'voluntas Dei per quam
omnia quae sunt convenientem deductionem accipiunt.'  Finis
autem ultimus cujuslibet creaturae est ut consequatur divinam
similitudinem, sicut supra (c. 17) ostensum est.  Esset igitur
providentiae repugnans, si alicui rei subtraheretur illud, per
quod assequitur similitudinem divinam:  agens autem voluntarium
assequitur divinam similitudinem in hoc, quod libere agit:
ostensum est enim liberum arbitrium in Deo esse:  non igitur
per providentiam prohibetur voluntatis libertas."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII14"><SUP>[14]</sup></a><p>

In the same chapter, he formally condemns the determinism
of the Stoics:<p>

"Per hoc autem excluditur opinio Stoycorum qui secundum
ordinem quendam causarum intransgressibilem, quem Graeci
ymarmenen vocabant, omnia ex necessitate dicebant provenire."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII15"><SUP>[15]</sup></a><p>

In his <i>Summa Theologica</i>, his most perfect work, the fruit of
his maturer years, in which the thought of his whole life is condensed,
the same truths are again and again enunciated.  In the
83d chapter of the first part, he unequivocally admits free will
in man:<p>

"Respondeo dicendum, quod homo est liberi arbitrii:  alioquin
frustra essent consilia, exhortationes, praecepta, prohibitiones,
praemia, et poenae.  Ad cujus evidentiam considerandum est,
quod quaedam agunt absque judicio, sicut lapis movetur deorsum;
et similiter omnia cognitione carentia.  Quaedam autem
agunt judicio, sed non libero, sicut animalia bruta.  Judicat
enim ovis videns lupum, eum esse fugiendum, naturali judicio,
et non libero:  quia non ex collatione, sed ex naturali instinctu
hoc judicat:  et simile est de quolibet judicio brutorum animalium.
Sed homo agit judicio:  quia per vim cognoscitivam judicat,
aliquid esse fugiendum, vel prosequendum.  Sed quia judicium
istud non est ex naturali instinctu in particulari operabili,
sed ex collatione quadam rationis, ideo agit libero judicio, potens
in diversa ferri:  ratio enim circa contingens habet viam ad opposita,
ut patet in Dialecticis syllogismis, et Rhetoricis persuasionibus:
particularia autem operabilia sunt quaedam contingentia
et ideo circa ea judicium rationis ad diversa se habet, et
non est determinatum ad unum.  Et pro tanto necesse est, quod
homo sit liberi arbitrii ex hoc ipso, quod rationalis est."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII16"><SUP>[16]</sup></a><p>

He even teaches that free acts are the only acts that may
properly be styled human:<p>

"Respondeo dicendum, quod actionum, quae ab homine aguntur,
illae solae proprie dicuntur humanae, quae sunt propriae hominis
inquantum est homo:  differt autem homo ab irrationalibus
creaturis in hoc, quod est suorum actuum dominus; unde illae
solae actiones vocantur proprie humanae, quarum homo est dominus;
est autem homo dominus suorum actuum per rationem et
voluntatem; unde et liberum arbitrium esse dicitur facultas
voluntatis, et rationis; illae ergo actiones proprie humanae dicuntur,
quae ex voluntate deliberate procedunt:  si quae autem aliae
actiones homini conveniant, possunt dici quidem hominis actiones,
sed non proprie humanae, cum non sint hominis, inquantum
est homo."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII17"><SUP>[17]</sup></a><p>

He discusses the relations of God to man more closely still
than in the <i>Summa contra Gentiles,</i> and reaches the same
conclusions:<p>

"Quia igitur voluntas est activum principium non determinatum
ad unum, sed indifferenter se habens ad multa; sic Deus
ipsam movet, quod non ex necessitate ad unum determinate sed
remanet motus ejus contingens, et non necessarius, nisi in his,
ad quae naturaliter movetur."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII18"><SUP>[18]</sup></a><p>

Therefore, there cannot be the slightest doubt as regards St.
Thomas's libertarianism.  It must be admitted, however, that
a peculiar doctrine of his, universally accepted by his modern
followers, seems, at first sight, to be hardly reconcilable with
human liberty it is the doctrine of prescience, predestination
and reprobation.  St. Thomas asks whether men are predestinated
by God, and he unreservedly answers that they are:<p>

"Deo conveniens est homines praedestinare."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII19"><SUP>[19]</sup></a><p>

He adds that God reprobates some men;<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII20"><SUP>[20]</sup></a> that the elect are
chosen by Him:<p>

"Unde praedestinatio aliquorum in salutem eternam praesupponit
secundum rationem, quod Deus illorum velit salutem.  Ad
quod pertinet electio, et dilectio";<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII21"><SUP>[21]</sup></a><p>

that the number of the elect is certain not only formally, but
materially; that is to say, God does not only know how many
men will be saved; but he also knows whether John, Peter and
Thomas will be saved:<p>

"Respondeo dicendum, quod numerus praedestinatorum est
certus.  Sed quidam dixerunt eum esse certum formaliter, sed
non materialiter: ut puta, si diceremus certum esse, quod centum,
vel mille salventur, non autem quod hi, vel illi.  Sed hoc
tollit certitudinem praedestinationis, de qua jam diximus.  Et
ideo oportet dicere, quod numerus praedestinatorum sit certus
Deo non solum formaliter, sed etiam materialiter."<A HREF="perrierg.html#VII22"><SUP>[22]</sup></a><p>

It is thus clear that, according to this view of St. Thomas,
God knows all future events; that, his knowledge being immutable,
all things will necessarily come to pass as he actually
knows them; that the number of the elect is thus determined;
that God knows, with regard to any man, not only whether he
will be saved or damned, but what the determination of his will
will be in each particular case; that there is not the slightest
possibility for any one of us to change in the least degree God's
eternal and immutable decrees in our regard.<p>

We do not deny that there is here an apparent clash with St.
Thomas's teaching about free will.  The opposition of the two
doctrines, however, exists only in appearance, and disappears as
soon as we grasp St. Thomas's conception of God.  His theory
of the Divine Being has been exposed in our chapter on Natural
Theology.  Suffice it to recall that God being eternal, there is
no future for him, but a perpetual present.  He has not existed
through an infinite temporal series, a series of successive instants
of which there was no beginning and which shall know no end;
he even does not properly exist:  He is.  What is a future for
us is thus not a future for God, and it is only an imperfection
of our language that compels us to speak of God's prescience.
He does not know our acts before we perform them; he knows
them as actual.  His knowledge is not logically anterior, but
posterior to the free determination of our will.  It is hard for
us, of course, limited as we are to our temporal series, to have
a clear conception of a knowledge of this kind.  We may, however,
have an idea of it -- though imperfect -- by considering our
own knowledge of the present and of the past.  We actually
know that John has done this and Thomas that, and our knowledge
does not interfere in the least with the freedom of their
actions.  It is in a similar way that God knows our future
deeds.  He knows them as done.  He predestinates some men
because they freely act in accordance with the moral law; he
reprobates others because they freely disobey his precepts; he
knows how many men will be saved just as we might know the
exact number of soldiers who were slain at Gettysburg.<p>
