<hr><H1>Origin of Scholasticism</h1>

'HE is in the schools,' at Oxford, means that a 
man is undergoing written examinations in a 
building known as the 'Examination Schools,' 
conspicuous at the east end of High Street.  Oral 
disputation, more or less in syllogistic form, 
used to be part of the examination -- in the 
Middle Ages it was the whole.  The men at Oxford, 
Paris, Cologne, and other medieval universities, 
who took part in those examinations, first as 
examinees, afterwards in their turn as Masters and 
Doctors, were known as 'Schoolmen,' or 
'Scholastics,' and the philosophy which was the 
staple of their examinations was the 
'scholastic philosophy,'<A HREF="schnt1.htm">*</a>     
or 'Scholasticism,' as we shall call it.  
Scholasticism is not quite dead at the present 
day: it is still the philosophy most countenanced 
by authority in the schools of the Catholic 
Church.  Nor is it possible to assign a precise 
date for its origin. Like the mediaeval 
universities which harboured it, it grew gradually 
from obscure beginnings. It will be convenient, 
however, to fix its rise in the eleventh century, 
and to call St. Anselm (1033-1109) the first 
scholastic, as he has also been called the last of 
the Fathers. The thirteenth century was the golden 
age of Scholasticism. For two centuries following 
it gradually declined: the Renaissance found it 
decadent; the latter half of the sixteenth century 
saw a splendid revival in Spain, but that was 
short-lived. Baconian physical science set in, and 
the Cartesian philosophy, and all the while 
Scholasticism was dying: at the end of the 
eighteenth century, the era of Kant and the French 
Revolution, Scholasticism was dead. It has had 
something of a resurrection since.<P> 

Now to the question with which Scholasticism 
started.  Porphyry, the Neo-Platonist, in his 
<I>Isagoge</i> wrote: 'Now concerning genera and 
species, whether they be substances or mere 
concepts of the mind; and if substances, whether 
they be corporeal or incorporeal, and whether they 
exist apart from sensible things or in and about 
sensible things, all this I will decline to say.' 
This sentence set the intellectual world of the 
eleventh century ablaze.  It was the celebrated 
question of Universals.  Universal Ideas, or 
General Concepts, characterise a class of things. 
Sometimes this class is a species (man, fish), 
sometimes a genus (animal).  There was ocular 
evidence of the existence of this fish and that 
fish, this man John, and that man Paul. But what 
was <I>fish</i> simply, <I>man, animal</i>? A mere 
name, and no more? So the Nominalists were said to 
teach; but it may be doubted whether there ever 
were any Nominalists, at least in the Middle Ages.
<A HREF="schnt3.htm">*</a>  If General 
Names are mere names, and have no meaning, then 
all human speech, carried on as it is by General 
Names, is gibberish.  Even the chattering of apes 
is scarcely that.  General Names must point to 
some object:  what is that object? Porphyry 
suggests, though he does not affirm it, 'a mere 
concept of the mind.' That affirmation was 
actually made by many.  They are known as 
Conceptualists. The philosophers, misnamed 
Nominalists, were really Conceptualists. There is 
this objection to Conceptualism, that if the 
object of the Universal is a mere concept of the 
mind, then human speech has a meaning, to be sure, 
it is not mere gibberish, but it does not attain 
to anything outside of the mind of the speaker. To 
say then that 'owls are night-birds' is not to 
affirm a fact of Natural History, but a fact of 
human thought. Ancient Conceptualism comes very 
near to modern Idealism.<P> 

The Realists held that there was something 
objective, something outside our minds, answering 
to these Universal Ideas. They who took this view 
differed among themselves, some holding the object 
of a Universal Idea to be itself universal and 
one, others holding it to be particular and 
multiplied with the multiplication of individuals.  
The former are called Ultra-Realists: they might 
also be called Platonic Realists. The latter are 
called Moderate Realists: we might call them 
Aristotelian Realists. To take an example: to the 
Ultra-Realist there is one ideal, universal, 
undying Humanity, found entire in Peter, the same 
entire in Paul, the same in James, the same in 
every man. To the Moderate Realist, Humanity is 
indeed something outside of the perceiving mind, 
but it exists only in individual living men, and 
is differentiated in each, one humanity in Peter, 
another humanity in Paul, and so forth. To the 
Moderate Realist, everything that exists is 
individual.  To the Ultra-Realist, the truest and 
highest realities are ideal and universal.  
Moderate Realism is undoubtedly true, but the 
difficulty grows upon you as you think of it, as 
every one well knows who has felt the fascination 
of Plato.  The early Realists inclined to 
Ultra-Realism.  So did St. Anselm; so did a very 
different man, the pantheist John Scotus Erigena (800-877).
<A HREF="schnt5.htm">*</a>   
A doughty Realist was William of 
Champeaux, bishop of Ch&acirc;lons (1070-1120), 
who, however, in the end was entirely driven out 
of his position by his disciple Ab&eacute;lard.  
Realism was opposed by Roscelin, a monk of 
Comi&egrave;ge, who was teaching in 1087; also by 
Ab&eacute;lard.  Peter Ab&eacute;lard (1079-1142), 
philosopher and theologian, the most brilliant 
thinker of his age, ran through a romantic and 
chequered career, the reverses of which he has 
recounted in his <I>Historia Calamitatum</i>.  As 
a theologian, he encountered the vehement 
opposition of St. Bernard.  We are only concerned 
with him as a philosopher. He clearly marked off 
philosophy as a distinct study from theology.  He 
endeavoured to base on grounds of reason certain 
mysteries of faith which were commonly thought to 
be established by revelation alone.  In this, his 
tendency was the very opposite of that followed 
later by Duns Scotus.  Ab&eacute;lard's theory of 
Universals, carefully considered, is not far 
removed from Moderate Realism.  Altogether, 
Ab&eacute;lard and his disciple, Gilbert de la 
Porr&eacute;e, bishop of Poitiers (1076-1154), as 
philosophers, in which capacity alone they enter 
into our purview, effected much for the advance of 
Scholasticism.  They had in their hands at least 
some portion of the Organon, or logical works, of 
Aristotle.  By the end of the twelfth century the 
whole of the Organon was in the hands of Western 
scholars, in a Latin translation.  Almost without 
exception, the Schoolmen were very slightly 
acquainted with Greek. The texts of the Greek 
philosophers slumbered in the libraries of 
Constantinople: the men of the West, whose spirit 
of ardent inquiry would have turned them to good 
account, had them not, and could not have read 
them.  East and West, in those days, though both 
Christian, were poles asunder in everything but 
their common faith. All the disputations in the 
Schools went on in Latin.  All the works of the 
Schoolmen are written in Latin. Latin was the 
universal language, that gave to European students 
of those days the privileges of cosmopolitans.  
Scholastic Latin is a very curious language. It is 
not simply bad Latin: it is no jargon: it has its 
rules and its terminology, all very exactly 
observed.  The Schoolmen indeed were masters of 
language; and in this respect compare very 
favourably with most modern philosophers. One 
peculiarity of scholastic Latin is the grafting of 
Greek idioms upon the Latin stock.  This arose 
from the Latin translations of Aristotle; works 
very literally executed, and, to say the truth, 
very obscurely, and even inaccurately.  
Considering the badness of their translations, it 
is a standing wonder how near the Schoolmen came 
to the mind of their great Master.<P> 

By the end of the twelfth century, Moderate 
Realism was triumphant in the Schools.  Throughout 
the great age of Scholasticism, the thirteenth 
century, the age of St. Thomas, its supremacy was 
unchallenged, and the scholastic intellect busied 
itself with other questions. Consequently it is a 
wrong definition to lay down that scholastic 
philosophy is the study of the nature of genera 
and species.<P> 

Robert Pulleyn may be mentioned as the earliest 
known scholastic lecturer in the nascent 
University of Oxford, early in the twelfth 
century. Another Englishman, John of Salisbury 
(1120-1180), friend of St. Thomas &agrave; Becket, 
and ultimately bishop of Chartres, more of a 
literary man than Schoolmen generally were, was at 
once a philosopher himself and the historian of 
the philosophy of his age. His best known works 
are the <I>Polycraticus</i> and the 
<I>Metalogicus</i>. While upholding Moderate 
Realism, he warned his readers not to consume all 
their philosophic leisure upon Universals. He 
argued the sterility of logic when separated from 
the more concrete sciences, a very necessary 
theory to point out in his age, when some were 
taking formal logic, others grammar, for the acme 
of all science. John was a politician too, and 
commented on Plutarch.  His contemporary Alan de 
Lille (1128-1202), surnamed 'the universal 
Doctor,' held similar views. Alan and John 
together represent the furthest advance of 
scholasticism in the twelfth century.<P>
