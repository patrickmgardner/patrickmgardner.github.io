<H1>Revival of Scholasticism</h1>

<B>1. The Revival of the Seventeenth Century.</b>

THE one hundred and fifty years from the middle
of the sixteenth to the end of the seventeenth
century is known in history as the period of the
Counter-Reformation.  During that period the
Catholic Church consolidated her position in
the countries that remained to her after the great
revolt, and planted herself by vast missionary
efforts in new lands. In Spain and Italy she
quite recovered, and even improved upon, the
position that had been hers in the Middle Ages.
With this revival of Catholicism, the dying
embers of Scholasticism were kindled into a new
glow in the countries just named. Two Religious
Orders, the Dominicans and the Jesuits, brought
their schools to a level which recalled the brighter
days of the now decadent University of Paris.
We will take some note of two great Jesuit
Doctors of this era.<P>

Gabriel Vasquez, S.J., 1551-1604, taught at
Rome and Aleali, mainly theology, which he has
bequeathed to us in a great commentary on the
<i>Summa Theologiae</i> of St. Thomas, with philosophy
interspersed. If Suarez was the Aristotle of the
Society of Jesus, Vasquez was the Plato. He and
Suarez were rivals in the schools. Vasquez is
always good reading, brilliant, suggestive, more
lively, too, than Suarez, but less sure-footed. By
this time the <i>Summa Theologiae</i> of St. Thomas
had replaced the <i>Sentences</i> of Peter Lombard as
the text-book in the schools. At the opening of
his commentary on the <i>Summa</i>, Vasquez has an
interesting defence of scholastic theology against
the allegations brought against it in the sixteenth
century.  Many of his remarks may serve as an
apology for scholastic philosophy in our time.
'We cannot deny that there have been in the
School very many who have treated questions
with frivolous reasons . . . . This is not the fault
of the science, but was the misfortune of the times,
in which minds were not so cultivated, nor arts
so elaborated, nor books so abundant.  Now that
there is a better supply of books, and much
greater exercise of intellect, our scholastic theology 
is daily enriched and treated with the
consideration that it deserves . . . . Secondly,
many, even Catholics, inveigh against scholastic
theology in this way.  There are doctors 
seemingly born for disputation, contentious, party
men, who care less about the investigation of
truth than about the defence of their own School,
and of their own Master to whom they have
sworn allegiance, to the no small injury of 
theology and truth . . . . But that is no fault of
Scholasticism, it is a fault of character . . . .
Francis Victoria, a disciple and keen defender of
St. Thomas, used to say (and he is followed also
by Melchior Canus), that the authority of St.
Thomas ought so far to prevail as to suffice for
us, if a better reason be not forthcoming; still,
that the words and reasons of so great a Doctor
were not to be accepted without discrimination
and examination. Nay, if St. Thomas said 
anything not altogether probable, that we ought to
imitate the Saint's own modesty and industry,
in neither disparaging the credit of the ancient
Doctors, nor adopting their opinion if reason
urged to the contrary. Wherefore Victoria wishes
us not to be so attached to the doctrine of St.
Thomas as to think it a crime to depart a 
hair's-breadth from any reason, ground, opinion, or 
conclusion of his.' On this, Vasquez quotes St.
Augustine: 'I should wish no one so to embrace
my opinions as to follow me except on points in
which he sees that I am not mistaken. On that
very account I am now writing my Retractations,
to show that I have not in all things followed
myself.' Vasquez goes on: 'But you see people
who of set purpose endeavour to refute St.
Thomas's doctrine, and then fancy they have
done gloriously when they have uttered a 
pronouncement against an opinion of his.  These
are worthy of no light reprehension, and undoubtedly 
are stopping their own way to the discovery
of truth.  The above-mentioned Thomists, then,
teach that such disinterestedness and sincere
desire of truth should rule our treatment of
matters doubtful and probable, not belonging
to dogmas of faith, that, for all our deference to
the authority of Blessed Thomas, reason, nevertheless, 
maturely pondered, should hold the first
place, wherever such reason can be found . . .
Some are offended at scholastic theology for its
style -- its uncultured mode of speech, its phraseology 
mean and vulgar, laden with barbarisms and
solecisms. These are the votaries of rhetoric and
eloquence; men who delight in words rather
than in things; who neglect the investigation of
the natures and properties of things and the
enucleation of difficulties; men who hate the
very name of Scholastics. Herein they are far
from following the teaching of their darling
Cicero, who, mentioning Epicurus in his book
<i>De Finibus</i>, writes: " The style of this philosopher
does not offend me, for he puts into words what
he means, and speaks plainly within my 
comprehension; and yet, if a philosopher brings
eloquence, I scorn it not; if he has it not, I do
not much miss it." . . . This barbarism and 
unskilful language of the Schoolmen is to be put
down rather to the fault and misfortune of the
age than to their subject. The subject would not
lose its force and instructiveness by being treated
in a purer style. The subject, however, does not
require great abundance of words and flow of
eloquence, but words few and sufficient to untie
the knot of the difficulty, a style plain and brief,
yet not obscure.'<A HREF="schnt78.htm">*</a><P>

Scholastic and modern philosophy differ in
their orientation. Not every reference to God
can be said to belong to (dogmatic or revealed)
theology.  God is to some extent known by
reason; and to that extent He is an object, nay
a principal object, of philosophy. Scholasticism,
then, and the philosophy of our day differ in this,
that Scholasticism is ever referring to God,
modern philosophy has for its centre, man. In
which particular, perhaps, it may be found that
modern philosophy stands to Scholasticism as
geocentrism to heliocentrism in astronomy.
Here is a specimen of what we may call 'heliocentric' 
or 'theocentric' philosophy from Vasquez. 
He is inquiring whether God dwells in the
great void beyond what Lucretius calls 'the
flaming walls of the world,' beyond the outermost
of the heavenly spheres of the Schoolmen, beyond
the gigantic bean-shaped enclosure which (modern
astronomers think) is the finite outline, measured
in light-years, comprehending all the stars and
nebulae, all the matter that is. The question
involves an inquiry into the nature of Space,
which surely no philosopher can neglect.
Vasquez then (in <i>Im, disp.</i> 29) answers the question
in the negative. For one thing to be in another,
the thing itself must be real, and that in which it
is must be real. But beyond the bounds of the
universe there is no reality, but sheer nothingness.
God is not in nothingness. Vasquez objects that
another universe might be created beyond the
bounds of the present; but not surely in nothingness; 
therefore that ultramundane continent, or
recipient, of creation is something other than
mere nothing.  Also that the whole universe may
possibly be in motion (a very pertinent objection);
hence if God is confined to the universe, He must
move with the universe. To the last allegation
Vasquez replies that motion must be between two
assignable points; but assign any point, and 
immediately God is there; therefore He cannot be
said to move from point to point, not even by
extrinsic denomination. For the rest, his reply
is not satisfactory. He admits the possibility of
the whole universe being in motion in a straight
line. On such issues, he remarks, 'many of these
curious questions serve to sharpen wits.' This
particular discussion remains of interest to every
one who, not content with the Kantian 'forms of
thought,' persists in the inquiry, What is space? --
that question which weighed on the mind of
Herbert Spencer in the last months of his life.
Space indeed, rightly considered, is no small
argument of the being of a God. The argument
is proper to philosophy.<P>

Francis Suarez, S.J., 1548-1617, 'the Excellent
Doctor,' the greatest theologian of his Order,
wrote copiously on nearly all subjects philosophical
and theological.  How far he should be regarded
as a faithful exponent of St. Thomas, and how far
as an original writer with views of his own, has
been matter of much dispute.  His great work on
philosophy is the bulky volume of his <i>Metaphysica</i>,
almost a life's work to master. Some idea of it
may be formed from the following account of the
thirteenth Disputation on 'the material cause of
substance,' a characteristically scholastic topic.
This then is the outline of Suarez's argument.  
According to the Aristotelian idea of generation
and corruption, the generation of one thing (<i>e.g.</i>
fire) being the corruption of another (<i>e.g.</i> tow),
material substances are ever passing one into
another.  'All sublunary things, so far as their
nature and composition goes, are transmutable
one into another.' The seventy or more chemical
elements which are not transmutable one into
another had not yet been registered. It was
thought that all bodies were made up of fire, air,
earth, and water, and that these were mutually
interchangeable.  The alchemists laboured strenuously 
to convert baser substances into gold.  This
convertibility of substance with substance supposes 
some common subject remaining under all
conversions: otherwise I the thing that is 
corrupted would perish to the whole extent of its
being, and the other thing that begins to be
would be made to the whole extent of its being,
if no common element remained underlying both.  
Thus the one would be annihilated and the other
created, which is an impossibility to nature.'
There must then be one common subject permanently 
underlying all natural transmutations:
that underlying subject is primordial matter
(<i>materia prima</i>). And what is that? Is it 
everywhere one and the same, or are there manifold
varieties?  Manifold, say the Atomists, Democritus, 
and his school. Atoms to them are primordial
matter, and atoms are of all shapes and sizes, and
infinite in multitude. Atomism is rejected by
Suarez on two grounds; first, because an infinite
multitude is impossible: secondly, because 'in
that system of philosophy, the forms of natural
things would be, we might say, artificial only,
being figures arising from the various positions
and orders of the atoms, and so there would be
no true substantial generation and corruption.'
The atoms in fact would be the only true 
substances, and they would be imperishable.  But
Democritus was wrong, and Suarez with him, in
supposing that the building-stones of a finite
world need be infinite in multitude. Primordial
matter then is of one sort only.  It is not one of
the four elements, for they pass one into another,
primordial matter remaining unchanged under
the transaction. It is no corporeal, complete
substance at all, atomic or otherwise. Were it a
complete substance, it would have a substantial
form. But nothing can have two substantial
forms together. And primordial matter underlies
all material substance.  Its form, then, if it had
one, would be the one sole form in all material
substance. Thus all material substance would be
permanently of the same species -- one substance
could never pass into another by change of 
substantial form. Primordial matter is not a 
substance; it has neither quantity nor quality nor
quiddity (essence) of its own; it is in potentiality
to all substantial forms; it is ready to turn into
anything. Nevertheless, 'primordial matter is
not absolutely nothing,' although it is 'nearly
nothing.' Were it absolutely nothing, it could
have no true and real function in nature; in
which case things corrupted and said to be
resolved into matter would be resolved into 
nothing, and things produced out of matter would
be produced out of nothing; and so matter would
serve no purpose in processes of generation and
corruption, since it would not serve for the avoiding 
of a perpetual creation and annihilation. Matter, 
therefore, is something of a reality, especially
when conjoined with form and entering into the
composition of a compound.' Primordial matter
is no accident, it is an appurtenance of substance,
it is really distinct from form, it has an essence
and existence of its own, albeit in dependence
on form. It is pure potentiality and something
besides, as an Irishman might say: in allowing 
this shadowy 'something besides' Suarez
inclines to Scotus rather than to the Thomists.
There follows a subtle inquiry into the part played
by primordial matter in causation. The heavenly
spheres have primordial matter in their 
composition, but matter of another sort than is found
in this sublunary world. The disputation ends
with a lengthy disquisition on the heavens.
The theory of primordial matter is fundamental
in Scholasticism. All scholastic writers treat of
it at length, although they differ over it. 
Nowhere does Scholasticism trench more upon the
domain of physics than in this, its central dogma 
of matter and form. The brief summary given
shows how much Suarez had to learn of the
modern physicist. The atomic theory, as it
stands to-day, will require to be handled otherwise 
than as he deals with Democritus.  The
hypothesis of there being one common 
mother-stuff underlying every variety of material body
requires a confirmation which it has not received
from Suarez.  It is indeed a doubtful hypothesis.  
And the doubt will have to be cleared up, if ever
it is cleared up, not by abstract arguments going
upon the obvious phenomena of daily life, such
as the burning of tow, but by all the elaborate
apparatus now at the command of the chemist
and the electrician: even the highest methods of
mathematical calculus may be called in to aid.  
Verily there is work for the twentieth-century
Schoolman who intends conducting a thoroughly
philosophical inquiry into materia prima.<P>

<B>2. The Leonine Revival of 1879.</b>

Leo XIII made two great pronouncements: one
on Civil Government, the Labour Question, and
Socialism; the other on Scholastic Philosophy,
notably the philosophy of the greatest of the
Schoolmen, St. Thomas Aquinas. On this latter
subject is the Encyclical <i>Aeterni Patris</i>, dated
4th August 1879.  The Pope deplores the decay
of philosophy, even in the Catholic schools, since
the sixteenth century. Philosophy has become a
house of confusion, every man babbling his own
conceits; nothing remains fixed and certain, there
is no foothold for science to climb by. His
Holiness continues:<P>
'We all see how the society of the family and
of the State itself is endangered by the pest of
perverse opinions. Society would be much more
peaceful and far more safe if in our Universities
and Schools there were taught a sounder doctrine,
more in accordance with the teaching of the
Church.  Such a doctrine is found in the volumes
of Thomas Aquinas. Thomas's arguments on the
true notion of liberty, now running into license,
on the divine origin of every sort of authority, on
laws and their force, on the paternal and equable
rule of the Sovereign Pontiffs, on obedience to
higher powers, on mutual charity amongst all
men, and the like subjects, all these his arguments 
are fraught with mighty and invincible
strength for the overthrow of those principles of
new-invented law, which are plainly perilous to
the order of society and the public safety. All
human branches of learning should anticipate and
hope for advancement, and promise themselves
much assistance, from the restoration of philosophical 
studies which We contemplate. Fact and
constant experience testify that the liberal arts
have been then most flourishing, while philosophy
has been held in honour and her judgment maintained 
in wisdom; on the other hand the decline
of philosophy into error or futilities has led to the
neglect, almost to the obliteration, of the other
parts of a liberal education. Even the physical
sciences, now so prized, and held everywhere in
such singular admiration for the splendid 
discoveries to which they have led up, far from
having any injury to expect from the restoration
of the philosophy of the ancients, may look to
derive great good. For their profitable exercise
and increase it is not enough to observe facts and
study nature, but when the facts are ascertained,
the student must rise higher, and make his aim
the careful recognition of the natures of corporeal
things, and the investigation of those laws and
principles on which depends the order of phenomena, 
their unity in variety, and their mutual
affinity in diversity. To such investigations
scholastic philosophy is likely to bring a wonderful 
measure of power and light and aid, provided it
be wisely taught. It is a calumny on that philosophy 
to say that it is opposed to the advance of
the physical sciences.  The Schoolmen, following
the opinion of the holy Fathers, everywhere
taught in their Anthropology that only by sensible
things is the human intellect raised to the
knowledge of things incorporeal and immaterial.
Hence they readily concluded that nothing was
more profitable for the philosopher than a diligent
inquiry into the secrets of nature, and a long
and profound study of physics. St. Thomas,
Blessed Albertus Magnus, and other leaders of the
Schoolmen, for all their study of philosophy,
spent much of their energies in seeking to acquire
knowledge of the facts of physics. Many of their
remarks and maxims on this head have met the
approval of modern authorities, and are acknowledged 
to be in accordance with the truth.
Therefore, to this very day, many eminent 
professors of physical science avow openly that
there is no real conflict between the certain and
approved conclusions of modern Physics and the
philosophical principles of the School. While,
then, We pronounce that every wise saying, no
matter who said it, every profitable invention or
contrivance, no matter who contrived it, is to be
willingly and gratefully taken up, We earnestly
exhort you all, Venerable Brethren, for the defence
and adornment of the Catholic faith, for the good
of society, for the advancement of all sciences, to
restore the golden wisdom of St. Thomas and
propagate it far and wide to the best of your
power. "The wisdom of St. Thomas," we say; for
if there be in the scholastic Doctors any excessive
subtlety of inquiry, any inconsiderate teaching,
anything less consistent with the ascertained 
conclusions of a later generation, in a word, anything
in any way improbable, we have no mind to hold
that up for the imitation of our age.' The Pope
concludes with a warning against pseudo-Thomism:
'But to the end that a supposititious doctrine be
not imbibed instead of the true, or the adulterated
for the genuine, take care that the wisdom of
Thomas be drunk in from his own fountains, or
at least from those streams which, in the certain
and unanimous opinion of learned men, may be
said to flow thence still uncontaminated and
undefiled; but from streams that are said thence
to flow, but really are swollen with foreign and
unwholesome contributions, take care to keep
your young students' minds away.'<P>

<B>3. The Future of Scholasticism.</b>

These wishes and commands of Leo XIII have
been repeated by his successor, Pius X. Will
they be ever carried out to any considerable
extent?   Will Scholasticism ever overleap the
walls of the Seminaries? Will it remain a philosophy 
for the clergy only, a vestibule to dogmatic
theology for those whose profession it is to be
theologians, or will it largely imbue the Catholic
laity also? Will it take a hold upon the universities? 
Will it ever colour, as Kant and Hegel
at this day colour, the thought of the writers in
our magazines? Any ordinary educated man
who spent a week with St. Thomas, Duns Scotus,
and Suarez, would come out, I fancy, crying:
'No chance; Scholastic tomes are only less
archaic than Babylonian bricks; Scholasticism is
as the traceable old bed of a river, which the
water once filled, but to which it will never
return; the current of modern thought has turned
irrevocably another way.' On the other hand a
great thinker has written: 'If ever there was a
power on earth who has had an eye for the times,
who has confined himself to the practicable, and
has been happy in his anticipations, whose words
have been facts and whose commands prophecies,
such is he in the history of ages who sits from
generation to generation in the chair of the
Apostles.' Nevertheless, a little further on, the
same writer adds: 'The past never returns'
(Newman, <i>The Idea of a University</i>, Discourse I).
If Newman is right, we may augur two facts for
the future: (1) Scholasticism will return; (2) It
will not return as it was in the Middle Ages.  In
other words, what will come back will be Neo-
Scholasticism.<P>

Like a thirteenth-century church, a parish
church still, in daily use; an ancient monument,
and something besides; a present-day house of
prayer, answering to the needs of a twentieth-century 
congregation, and for that purpose
refitted, repaired, and restored, Scholasticism
must be vindicated from the ravages of time, and
the still worse ravages of injudicious handling;
its main plan and outline, old and true, must be
retained; it must remain essentially the building
that it was; but it must receive new furniture,
and be enlarged to take in new discoveries. And
whatever there is in it, old indeed, but proved to
be inconsistent with truth, must be removed.  
The reader has much misread these pages, if he
takes Scholastic philosophy to be one and the
same with the deposit of Catholic faith. Scholasticism 
is not 'the faith once given to the saints'
(Jude, 3). It is a product of human reason, like
any other philosophy. It has not come down
from heaven, but man made it, and man may
change it. It is irreformable, to a Catholic, only
so far as its conclusions happen to coincide with
dogmas taught by the Church. Hence there is
no impiety in the idea of a Neo-Scholasticism.<P>

We are not called upon simply to re-echo
St. Thomas, or any other mediaeval doctor,
piling up quotations, adding nothing and altering
nothing. St. Thomas himself did not go to
work in that way upon his predecessors, no,
not even upon Aristotle. We are called upon
to follow a living, not a dead Thomas; to say
now what St. Thomas would say, were he now
alive.<P>

Any pretence to tell what St. Thomas now
would, say, were he alive, must be illusory unless
it be grounded upon an accurate and adequate
knowledge of what he actually has said in the
writings which he has bequeathed to us.  The
one safe foundation of Neo-Thomism, then, is
Thomism, by which I here mean a thorough hold
on the philosophical system of St. Thomas as it
appears in his works. A pioneer and founder of
Neo-Thomism will not in all things remain a
Thomist, but he must begin with being a Thomist
in the sense just defined. He must have caught
up with the Saint before he can go beyond him.
His goal must be the twentieth century, but his
starting-point the thirteenth.  He must carry
Thomas faithfully through seven centuries, and
in his furthest and most daring innovation be
still Thomistic.<P>

He must unsay without reserve whatever it is
certain that St. Thomas, were he now living,
would unsay; and that is whatever is in manifest
contradiction with the valid and firm conclusions
of science, <i>e.g.</i> Ptolemaic astronomy, the doctrines
of the four elements, the four humours, and astral
influences. It will be found on trial how the
metaphysics and psychology of St. Thomas stand
clear of these errors, wonderfully clear, considering 
how rooted those errors were. He, indeed,
continually refers to them, and accepts them for
truths, but they serve him rather as illustrations
than as arguments. Of illustrations, taken from
the physics of their day, the works of all the
Schoolmen are full. Those writings seem in 
consequence more archaic and more out of date than
in substance they really are. Sometimes the
illustration might be dropped; sometimes it
might be replaced by another drawn from modern
physics; sometimes we may retain it, remembering 
that it is but the first outward seeming of
things that we have to regard, this especially
when the illustration is from light and colour;
sometimes, too, it must be confessed, the scholastic
metaphysician has been led astray by the analogy
of a mistaken physics, and there we have to
correct him.  The Neo-Thomist, however, will
prefer to draw his illustration from the newer
physics. When a philosopher refers to a physical
phenomenon even for an illustration, we expect
him to regard it rather with the eye of science
than with untutored sense.<P>

On the other hand, there are clear fixed principles 
which, living in no age of the world, would
St. Thomas ever unsay. He would never unsay
any of the dogmatic teachings of that Church
which has numbered him among her Doctors.
An anti-Catholic Thomist is a contradiction in
terms. Nor would he consent to enter upon any
line of thought, which his far-sighted intelligence 
discerned to be such as must by inevitable
logic, sooner or later, place the thinker who
followed it up in contradiction with Church
teaching. Hence he would be no friend to the
Kantian, the Neo-Kantian, the Hegelian synthesis.  
Between Hegel and St. Thomas, between Kantism 
and Scholasticism, there is a truceless war.
They cannot amalgamate, there is no via media
between them: their first principles are in mutual
contradiction, they will never 'meet in a higher
unity.' Neo-Thomism must, at least, be
scholastic; that is to say, it must be dualist, it
cannot bear any tincture of Idealism, Monism,
Pantheism. Its God must be a transcendent
God, 'high above all nations, and his glory above
the heavens.' He must be a Creator, and His
creative act must be a free act. He must be
one and the same, complete in Himself, whether
the world exists or not. There must be no
being anywhere that is not of Him. Between
His Being and that of created things the 
resemblance must not be generic, but only analogous;
He being the great Ideal, of which all things else
are inadequate copies. This philosophy is 
extremely unpopular in the world at present.
Scholasticism, however, cannot court popularity
by forswearing itself. If you are a Monist, then
you are not a Thomist, nor a Scotist, nor even a,
Terminist. You are outside the School.
Neo-Thomism must also retain the impress of
Aristotelianism. St. Thomas sometimes 
consciously went beyond Aristotle. On the whole,
he was more concerned to square Aristotle with
Christian teaching than to square himself with
Aristotle. On the questions of Divine Providence
and the condition of the soul after death, it must
remain at least doubtful whether Avicenna and
Averroes or St. Thomas were better exponents of
Aristotle's mind.  Still less can the Neo-Thomist
be in all things Aristotelian. Nevertheless, apart
from theology and apart from physics, Aristotle
is an author whom it is peculiarly dangerous
to contradict.  He has a knack of proving right
upon further study. Eschewing Kant, the 
Neo-Thomist will stand for Aristotle. He will study
'what is,' not 'what we are compelled to think.'
On the subject of matter and form, or 'hylomorphism' 
as it is called, the Neo-Thomist
will strongly hold that in man the soul is the
form, the body, the matter. He will hold it on
philosophical grounds, seeing that this doctrine
fits in with modern biological research far
better than the 'boatman-in-boat' theory of
Plato.<P>

The extension of hylomorphism to the whole
of nature, and notably to the constitution of
inorganic bodies, is a much more dubious speculation. 
If, apart from theological issues, Scholasticism 
and all Scholastic writers have one common
favourite notion, it is the notion of primordial
matter (<i>materia prima</i>).  On this the 
Neo-Thomist has the option of two courses. Either
he may declare, as some have done, that the
notion is founded upon obvious data of sense,
and being built upon what is plain to all men is
independent of scientific research, or he may
endeavour to find <i>materia prima</i> underlying
atoms resolved into electric currents, or into
whatsoever other elements, extended or unexextended, 
the atom may finally prove resoluble.
Which of these two courses the Neo-Thomist will
take, and if he take the second, what will come
of it, we are wholly unable to forecast. But he
will have to make up his mind decidedly on
<i>materia prima</i>.<P>

Another choice, likewise beyond our prediction,
will have to be made in psychology, on the retention 
or discarding of the 'active'and the 'potential'
intellect. Certainly the mind does form universal
ideas, and as certainly does it store them.  Intellect
in man, then, must be active and must be
potential; but unless we get beyond this verbiage -- 
and the scholastics did go much further -- we
are not beyond Moli&egrave;re's <i>vertu soporifique</i>.  One
schoolman of no mean ability, writing in a French
Review, has urged the abandonment of speculations 
on 'active' and 'potential'; he would make
the permanent self, underlying transient impressions, 
the first intellectual idea grasped by the
mind; thence he would derive further ideas
of 'being,' 'substance,' 'cause,' and the like.  But
we are now merely indicating questions, not
solving them.<P>

The proof of the existence of God will be
a main consideration for the Neo-Thomist.
Having before him Aristotle, <i>Metaphysics</i> xi. [al.,
xii]; <i>Physics</i>,. vii. viii., along with the Ptolemaic
astronomy with its <i>primum mobile</i>, St. Thomas
wrote: 'Aristotle proceeds to prove the existence 
of God from the consideration of motion as
follows. Everything that is in motion is put and
kept in motion by some other thing. It is
evident to sense that there are beings in motion.  
A thing is in motion because something else puts
and keeps it in motion. That mover, therefore,
either is itself in motion or not. If it is not in
motion, our point is gained which we proposed to
prove, namely, that we must posit something
which moves other things without being itself in
motion, and this we call God.  But if the mover
is itself in motion, then it is moved by some
other mover. Either then we have to go on to
infinity, or we must come to some mover
which is motionless; but it is impossible to go on
to infinity, therefore we must posit some motionless 
prime mover.'<A HREF="schnt98.htm">*</a><P>

It still remains to be proved that an 
immovable Prime Mover can be no other than a
Personal God.<P>

To this argument a modern physicist might
object that while it is true, by the Newtonian
law of inertia, that a thing is in motion because
something else has put it in motion, by the same
law it is untrue to say that a thing is kept in
motion because something else keeps it in motion:
once set going, the thing keeps in motion of
itself: the intervention of an external cause is
required, not to keep it in motion, but to stop
or alter its motion. Secondly, it will be said, the
argument supposes this principle, that nothing
moves another thing except by virtue of itself
being in motion. That principle is contrary to
the Newtonian law of gravitation.  One planet
attracts or pulls at another equally well whether
itself be in motion or not; and the like of 
repulsion. It happens, indeed, that everything in
the universe is in motion, but that is an accident
to the mutual attractive or repulsive powers of
particles of matter one on another.  If all parts
of the universe had been created at rest, motion
would have at once ensued among them by their
mutual attractions and repulsions. Here is no
need of any prime mover. Motion is like 
conversation: it springs up by mutual interaction.
The buzz of conversation that begins as soon
as grace has been said at a meal, does not
necessarily start from the head of the table. We
need no prime talker, nor prime mover either.  
If it is contended that not mere random motion
is here alleged, but the movements of an orderly
world, the elements of which must have been
arranged in positions of advantage from the first 
-- if we pass from motion to the energies of the
universe, and invoke the principle of the conservation 
of energy -- then more may be made of
the argument. The discussion has been drawn
out thus far, not in malevolence, but as an
invitation to the Neo-Thoinist to go deep into
modern physics, if he wishes to vindicate a
favourite argument of his master.<P>

The hope of Scholasticism as a philosophy
for the future seems to rest on its alliance
with Physical Science. Let scholastic metaphysicians 
be physicists, or with the physicists,
and they may yet win back the sceptre from
Hegel. Nor are the two families unconnected.
The true ancestors of the physicists of to-day
are not the Humanists of the Renaissance, but
the Schoolmen of the thirteenth century. For
Scholasticism did make it its endeavour, by its
own method and according to its own notions
and opportunities, to inquire into nature.  Moreover, 
our physical science sadly needs the co-operation 
of some sound metaphysics; for though the
two provinces be distinct, yet they are adjoining,
and professors of physical science are continually
making incursions into metaphysics, not always
with the happiest results.<P>

Neo-Scholasticism will require great leaders;
or if the age of great personalities be for ever
past, then the organised co-operation of many
ordinary men in all seats of learning, knowing
one another, and acting together. Nothing great
will be done by spasmodic efforts: nothing will
be achieved by second-rate minds working in
isolation. The chief centres of Neo-Scholasticism
at present are Louvain and Rome. Perhaps there
is more of the Neo in the University of Louvain,
and more of the Scholastic under the shadow of
the Vatican.<P>

Scholasticism in the Middle Ages, as we have
seen, was a clerical philosophy. Dante, indeed,
is an instance of an illustrious layman, highly
conversant with Scholasticism; but the students
who thronged the halls of mediaeval Paris and
Oxford, intent upon philosophy, were chiefly
clerics.  Philosophy, like so many other things,
has been laicised since then.  Will Scholasticism
ever be laicised, or will it remain a property of
the Seminary?<P>

The future of Scholasticism is an interesting
study, because upon Scholasticism, to all appearance, 
so at least Popes have thought, depends in
great measure the hopes of the Roman Catholic
Church ever recovering the ascendancy which she
has lost over the intellect of mankind.<P>
