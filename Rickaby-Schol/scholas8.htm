<H1>Chapter Vll: Scholastic Ethics and Politics</h1>

<B>1. The Ethics of the Schoolmen.</b>

THE Ethics and Politics of the Schoolmen are
founded upon the <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> and the
<i>Politics</i> of Aristotle. Nevertheless, being 
Christian, the School did not depend upon the ancient
Greeks for ethical teaching so much as for logic
and metaphysics. The Aristotelian ethics stood
alone, complete, but isolated.  The Schoolmen
added to them a science of Deontology, and
thereby brought them into connection with
Theology. They added to Aristotelian virtues
such notions as Duty, Obligation, Sin, a Sovereign
Lawgiver and Judge, Reward and Punishment in
a life to come. They brought ethical conduct
under a law, and for that law they provided an
adequate sanction. Aristotelian Ethics make a
system of Eudaemonism, but stop short of
Deontology. Aristotle points out the road to
happiness (<i>eudaemonia</i>), but makes little or no
attempt to characterise that road as the path
of duty (<i>deon</i>). If the fellow does not want to
be rationally happy, Aristotle would say, he is a
fool, and must be expelled my lectures. The
Schoolman says more. The man who will not
take the road of rational happiness is a 
law-breaker. He breaks a law, formulated indeed by
his own conscience, but imposed by an authority
from without, which is the authority of the
Supreme Reason, God, Creator and Lord. In
refusing the way of virtue and rational happiness
man not only plays the fool, he commits sin.
And sinning, he must be punished. This punishment 
is radically <i>natural</i>, inasmuch as by sinning 
and depraving himself, man becomes unfit
for rational happiness, and stores in his frame
the elements of misery. This is an ethical
consideration. The punishment is, further, a
<i>positive</i> infliction, proceeding from the will and
judicial sentence of the offended Legislator.
This is a theological consideration. And similarly 
of happiness and reward. To do right
conscientiously and systematically is to build
up habits of virtue; it is to form to oneself a
character of goodness; it is to become <i>naturally</i>
a fit subject for happiness, and <i>positively</i> to
merit an award of happiness from the just Eternal Judge.<P>

About the best thing that Scholasticism has
done is the perfecting of the Aristotelian scheme
of happiness, and the adaptation of it to the
Christian promises, contained in Scripture and
Church tradition, as set forth in many a glowing
page of St. Augustine. Plato and Aristotle,
Augustine and Aquinas, here felicitously join
hands. Plato with his vision of Beauty in the
<i>Symposium</i>, Aristotle with his account of the
crowning happiness of contemplation in the tenth
book of the <i>Ethics</i>,<A HREF="schnt105.htm">*</a>  
Augustine on the vision of
God in the latter books of his <i>Confessions</i>, finally
St. Thomas, <i>Contra Gentiles</i>, iii. 17-63, all come
together in anticipating the prophecy, <i>We
shall see him as he is</i> (I John, iii. 2): <i>And
they shall see his face, and his name upon
their foreheads</i> (Rev. xxii 4).<P>

St. Thomas altogether takes up the Aristotelian
argument, that man's last and highest happiness
consists in <i>theoria</i>, or the contemplation of the
understanding for contemplation's sake; for
<i>theoria</i> alone fulfils the requisite of perfect
happiness, to be self-sufficient, not useful to a
further end, and to be proper to man as man,
or rather, proper to man in respect of the highest
element of his being.  The only point in which
this contemplation fails to meet requirements is
this, that, taking life as it is, our contemplation
cannot be continual, it is fitful and uncertain.
To this objection Aristotle coolly replies that it
only shows that happiness in full perfection is
beyond the reach of man to attain; he must make
the best of a bad adventure, and realise this ideal
of happiness in such transient and inadequate
fashion as he may; better an hour of that than
fifty years of any other occupation; better, no
doubt, an eternity of it, but eternity is not to be
had; man must be content in a mortal life to
play the immortal. This we do by philosophising.
pursuing science and scholarship for its own sake,
not for any vulgar utility. In fact Aristotle
places happiness precisely in what are now called
'useless studies.' And because few men have
leisure and ability for such pursuits, Aristotelians
say that few men can be happy.  As the flower
and fruit is but a small part of the plant, and still
the plant may be said to be for the flower and
the fruit, so the vast organism of human society
exists for the sake of these few 'useless' but
happy students. Philosophers are the flower of
humanity.  This view, however, did not wholly
satisfy Aristotle's great exponents, Greek and
Arabian, Alexander and Averroes, each <i>honoris
causa</i> named 'the Commentator.' They looked for
the realisation of his <i>theoria</i> not to any ordinary
study of sciences, but to a mystical union with
a higher Intelligence. Upon these aspirations
St. Thomas writes: 'Alexander and Averroes
laid it down that the final happiness of man is
not in such knowledge as is possible to man
through the speculative sciences, but in a knowledge 
gained by conjunction with a separately
subsistent Intelligence, which conjunction they
supposed to be possible to man in this life.  But
because Aristotle saw that there was no other
knowledge for man in this life than that which
is through the speculative sciences, he supposed
man not to gain perfect happiness, but a limited
happiness suited to his state.  In all which
investigation it sufficiently appears how hard
pressed on this side and on that those fine
geniuses were. From this stress of difficulty
we shall escape in positing, according to proofs
already furnished, that man can arrive at true
happiness after this life, the soul of man being
immortal.  In this disembodied state the soul
of man will understand in the way in which pure
spirits understand. The final happiness of man,
then, will be in the knowledge of God, which
the human soul has after this life according to
the manner in which pure spirits know him'
(<i>Contra Gentiles</i>, iii. 
48).<A HREF="schn108a.htm">*</a><P>

If any one would see for himself the blend of
Aristotelian with Christian virtues, of virtues with
commandments, of moral deformity with sin,
he may read it at length in what is called the
<i>Secunda Secundae</i> of St. Thomas's <i>Summa
Theologiae</i>.<A HREF="schn108b.htm">*</a>
One remark about Casuistry, or
the study of cases of conscience, principally in
view, of the practice of the confessional. The
principles of the science are to be met with in
the great Schoolmen, but the developments are
not due to them. Casuistry interested the human
mind chiefly in the seventeenth century, when the
star of Scholasticism had paled before Descartes.

<B>2. The Politics of the Schoolmen.</b>

For a thousand years and more -- for some
fourteen centuries in the East -- the State to the
Church meant the Roman Empire.  There were,
to be sure, barbarian kings many and lords many,
Persian, Gothic, Hun, Saxon: these were but
faint copies, or distorted caricatures of the
Majesty that dwelt, or had dwelt, in Rome.
There was no king but Caesar, however he might
be girt with a Persian scimitar at his side, or
swing in his rude hand a German battle-axe.  
Did not the ninth-century monarch of Wessex
or Northumbria inscribe on his coins <i>basileus</i>,
the Greek name of the Roman Emperor, to imply
that he was the Augustus Caesar of Britain? The
treatment that the Church experienced at the
hands of the Roman State for three centuries was
an uncertain tolerance, interrupted by outbursts
of fierce persecution. Then the Empire became
officially Christian, and at times did the Church
more harm by its patronage than it had done by
its hostility. Still Church and State hung 
together, and when the barbarians broke up the
Empire of the West, Church missionaries went
among them bearing in their right hand the
Gospels and in their left Roman law and Roman
social institutions. When a great Christian ruler
of many peoples appeared in the person of Charlemagne, 
the Church gladly bestowed upon him, as
a sacred gift, the consecration and name of
Roman Emperor. He was declared 'Caesar, the
unconquered, ever Augustus.' When his posterity 
lapsed into feebleness, the Church in the
middle of the tenth century, a hundred and fifty
years after Charlemagne, saluted a new Roman
Emperor in the person of Otto the 
First.<A HREF="schnt110.htm">*</a> Thence
to the end of the eighteenth century there was
ever a Holy Roman Empire by the side of the
Holy Roman Church. On the whole the two
powers got on ill together. In the most flourishing 
period of Scholasticism, Christendom was distracted 
by the strife of Papacy and Empire. We
have seen a prince of the School, William Ockham, 
abandon his professorial chair to turn
Imperial partisan. The political science of the
Schoolmen, then, was conditioned by the political
situation of their times. In their idea Christendom 
somehow was one, not one religious body
merely, but one political body, a Christian 
commonwealth. True, there were various princes
and nationalities, but in an age of feudalism no
very close coherence of parts was thought necessary 
to form a kingdom, no very definite unity of
authority, no intense centralisation.  The Roman
Emperor was in theory the political chief of a
united Christendom. The English, of course, were
insular, and claimed that their island was beyond
the bounds of the Empire: they were tolerated as
outer barbarians, amiable men with queer notions;
and besides, from the time of John, their land
was held to be a fief of the Holy See: indeed all
islands, Ireland as well as England, were 
considered by some canonists to be appanages of the
See of Rome.  While Scholasticism was at its
best, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
kings indeed went to war, and their vassals
followed them, but nation had not yet risen
against nation: the very name 'nation' did not
signify a distinct State, but only a difference of
race, or less than that, merely of geographical
position. Thus Picardy was a 'nation' at the
University of Paris; and in that of Oxford there
were two 'nations,' the northern and the southern
English, Scotland going with the former, and
Ireland and Wales with the latter.  When what
we call nations emerged towards the end of the
fifteenth century, Scholasticism was already in its
decline.  The best mediaeval scholastic intellect
was never given to a Europe such as lies before
our view.  Consequently there is a certain archaeism 
in Scholastic Politics. The Hugo Grotius of
the Schoolmen is Francis Suarez, with his treatise,
<i>De Legibus</i>, and that was written in the early
seventeenth century.<P>

The antithesis before the Schoolman was not
Church and State: it was Pope and Emperor -- in
England and France, Pope and King. These
were the two luminaries in the firmament of
heaven, the greater and the lesser. Whence
the greater came, every one in those days knew:
but what was the origin of the lesser luminary?
From the devil, said some; it was a consequence
of the Fall; had we remained in paradise, there
would have been no kings. 'They all put on
diadems, and their sons after them for many
years, and evils multiplied upon the earth' (I
Maccabees, i. 9).  It was remembered how Rome
owed its origin to the asylum, said to have been
opened by Romulus on the Palatine for robbers
and murderers. Nevertheless it was admitted
that kingly power was a necessity in our present
condition, and must be endured, as the necessity
for wearing clothes, and consulting physicians,
which things would not have been had we kept
our innocence.<P>

No, said others, the king's power is a holy
thing, the gift of Christ to Peter; and Peter's
successor has given it to the Emperor, and so to
Christian Kings who owe the Emperor reverence.
So said Augustinus Triumphus and Alvarius
Pelagius, and sundry others, but no great Schoolman 
took this view: it is censured by the poet of
Scholasticism, Dante, <i>Purgatorio</i>, c. xvi.<P>

The Roman Jurists gravely asserted that all
Imperial and Royal power is the gift of the
People. The People, whose is the sovereignty by
original right, finding themselves too unwieldy a
body to administer it efficiently, have made it
over by a <i>lex regia</i>, 'a king-making law,' to the
Emperor. He is their <i>vicarius</i>, or 
representative.<A HREF="schnt113.htm">*</a>
Whether this power had been transferred to the
Emperor without reserve, whether it had been
transferred irrevocably or could for any just cause
be resumed, was a point on which the Jurists
were not agreed. This theory of the original
sovereignty of the people came into remarkable
prominence in the Jesuit schools during the
century following the Reformation. At that
epoch Protestant Sovereigns entirely, and even
Catholic Sovereigns partially, had possessed 
themselves of ecclesiastical power. The theory, then,
was resuscitated by Bellarmine and Suarez in the
interest of the Church, to curb the pretensions
of those princes of reigning with God-given 
prerogative, the immediate, irresponsible ministers
of the Most High. Suarez was by no means the
inventor of this theory, which is exposed in his
work, called <i>Defensio Fidei</i>, written against
James i. in 1612.  This ancient theory, be
it observed, knows nothing of any Social
Contract to live in society: it agrees with
Aristotle in taking man to be a social or
political animal by nature: it is not the theory
of Rousseau.<A HREF="schnt114.htm">*</a><P>

This theory of the Jurists must have been 
well-known to St. Thomas. He neither repudiates nor
explicitly accepts it. He deals with the further
question, how there came to be such a thing
as authority at all. In his answer he closely
follows Aristotle's <i>Politics</i>, giving them a 
theological turn. Authority is necessary to human
society, and society is a necessity of man's nature.
In solitude and isolation from his fellows man is
not a man, as a dead hand is not a hand, except
in an analogical sense. A hermit must be either
a brute or an angel: he is not in the category of
human kind. Man is a social animal more than
any bee or ant. Bees and ants are gregarious,
but man is social: he absolutely requires to be a
member of a rational community. Nor is the
community of family life sufficient: families must
form societies, and the society of families is 
ultimately the State. One State, one authority.
Anarchy is the destruction of the State, and
thereby the ruin of the individual. The individual
can only thrive as the citizen. So far Aristotle
and St. Thomas.<P>

Suarez and modern Schoolmen continue thus.
We regard God as the author of nature, and
whatever is necessary for human nature to work
out its essential development is the ordinance of
God. So then civil society, and its consequent
civil authority, is the ordinance of God. The
powers that be are ordained of God. To disobey
them is to disobey Him who is the author of that
nature to which they are a necessity. God forbids
anarchy as severely as He forbids any excess
against temperance. Thus the civil ruler is of
God, not in virtue of any positive institution or
revelation from heaven, but by virtue of God
having created a nature to the proper unfolding
of which the State and the civil ruler is indispensable. 
In whose hands the civil power shall
reside, that is not argued here. That depends upon
history and individualising circumstances.  The
distribution of power will be various, but some
civil power there must be. The specific ratio
of civil authority is from God: the individual
who wields that authority is of God only inasmuch
as in him, here and now for the present, such civil
authority becomes an actuality.<P>

The assignment of a rational or natural basis to
the State sets aside two of the theories that have
been mentioned. It sets aside the notion that the
State is of the Evil One, or is a necessary evil, the
consequence of the Fall. Not the mere evil, but
the good of human nature it is that bids the civil
ruler take and hold his place. Also it overturns
the notion that civil government is a property of
Christianity as such, and therefore belongs in chief
to the living Head of Christendom, the Pope, whose
vicars, or vassals, all kings must be. Not as a
Christian, but as man simply, is man a social
animal for the purposes of this life. The State
is a natural institution, not a supernatural or
spiritual entity: the State, therefore, as such, does
not belong to the Pope, just as land, houses,
money, and other property are not all given over
into the hand of the successor of St. Peter. To
Caesar the things that are Caesar's.  Nevertheless
'the Church laid it down that, while the civil and
ecclesiastical polities existed in different orders
and for different purposes, and were so far forth
independent of one another as their orders and
purposes were different, yet the spiritual order
was superior to the temporal, salvation of more
consequence than political 
well-being.'<A HREF="schnt117.htm">*</a>  
'Man is not subservient to the political 
community to the extent of his whole self, all that
he is and all that he has,' writes St. Thomas. Not
throughout the whole range of his nature is man
a political being.  He is a citizen and more than
a citizen. He is, or may be, philosopher, poet,
artist, father, friend; and in all these capacities
he is something over and above a limb of the
State.  The State has neither ability nor right to
control his thoughts. If he has an immortal
soul, he belongs already by anticipation to a world
in which there is no State.  He shall outlive the
State, and must look forward to the time when
the State for him shall be no more. Even then
while he still lives one of its components, he 
cannot wholly be contained in the State.  This 
doctrine involves a certain <i>aloofness</i> of the individual
from the State, and prevents his entire absorption
in it. There are traces of this aloofness in 
pre-Christian philosophy, much more in Christianity,
and therefore in Scholasticism.<P>

This train of thought brings us within sight of
some hope of removing from Scholasticism a
reproach, which more than any other cause has
prejudiced the modern mind against it, and is the
greatest obstacle to its propagation.  I mean the
reproach of being pledged to foregone conclusions,
of being tethered to orthodoxy like a captive
balloon to the earth. This reproach grows greater
with the lapse of time, as the attaching ropes are
multiplied and made stronger by new condemnations 
of error and new definitions of faith.  The
reproach may be removed by this reflection, that
definitions of faith fall upon judgments, not upon
reasonings; not upon speculations, but upon
assents. It is a rule of the Higher Philosophy to
speculate freely, but to assent cautiously, to think
much but believe little. Faith challenges our
belief, not our logic: it does not say, <i>this is proved</i>,
but <i>this is</i>.  You may call Scholasticism, or any
orthodox philosophy, a captive balloon, but for
tentative ascents, for exploration and reconnoitring 
purposes, the ropes that hold it stretch to
infinity. You may see and meditate all that can
be said for any condemned doctrine, provided you
do not hold the doctrine 
itself.<A HREF="schnt119.htm">*</a>  You may sound
all the depths of Hegelianism, and see with your
mind's eye all the gloomy visions of Schopenhauer,
provided you hold fast to the Nicene Creed and
Vatican Council, and do not deny, however little
in some respects you may be able to justify, the
Providence of God. Nor is it quite exact to say
that the dogmas of faith are forgone conclusions.  
They are forgone truths.  They are not presented
to our belief as conclusions.  We may never be
able to reach them by way of conclusion. Some
are confessedly inaccessible to conclusive argument, 
as the doctrine of the Triune God. Some
may be accessible, but I cannot find the way.
There is a way up the Matterhorn, others have
gone to the top, I start and fail. I have to take
the feasibility of the ascent on the word of others.
So with such a doctrine as the immortality of the
soul. I have not the least doubt that the soul is
immortal: my faith tells me so. But I am as free
as any other man in judging of the value of the
arguments for immortality. I may search them
all, and condemn them all; and, with Scotus, I
may have to fall back upon my faith as the one
sure guarantee of my immortality. A truth of
faith can never be in question; but my ability
rationally to vindicate a given truth of faith is a
very open question indeed. I am satisfied with
the word of God; but my own philosophical, or
critical and historical speculations, may fail to
satisfy me, at least for the present. Perhaps I
may reason better to-morrow: meanwhile I will
believe, even to-day.<P>

A Catholic will say: this free philosophical
speculation, trying all conclusions, but holding
aloof from assents, where the word of the Church
forbids them, is a dangerous game. It is dangerous. 
Alpine climbing is dangerous, and foxhunting. 
All the stronger efforts of man's body
and mind are fraught with danger, not excluding
the paths of higher sanctity. There is danger of
broken limbs, of lunacy, of intellectual pride and
apostasy. If Scholasticism is to revive -- and
Popes have bidden it live again -- the 
Neo-Scholastic who shall lead the movement of
revival will need to be a man of great faith,
fearless speculation, and absolute reliance on the
word of God.<P>

'What makes against the faith, either as a 
consideration in the mind of the believer, or in the
way of exterior persecution, augments the merit
of faith, so far forth as it reveals a will more
prompt and firm in the faith.  Therefore also the
martyrs had greater merit in faith, not receding
from the faith for persecutions; and likewise men
of learning have greater merit of faith, not 
receding from the faith for the reasons of philosophers 
or heretics alleged against it.' -- (St. Thomas,
<i>Summa Theologiae</i>, 2a-2ae , q. 2, art. 10).<P>
