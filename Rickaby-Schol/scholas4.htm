<H1>Common Characteristics of Scholasticism</h1>

DIFFERING much among themselves, and fighting
one another vigorously, the Schoolmen still make
one school of philosophy, and present a united
front against adversaries, contemporary and 
subsequent.  They are all orthodox, in the Roman
Catholic sense; they are all dualist (not pantheist,
idealist, or monist); they are all optimist (taking
a cheerful view of the world and of the 
competency of human reason); they are all static,
or feudal, believing in a fixed hierarchy of
beings.<P>

     <B>1. Orthodoxy.</b>  The Schoolmen were Churchmen,
faithful to the Church they served. Their
every page testifies to their zeal for orthodoxy. If
some were less orthodox than others, they were
also less scholastic. They speculated with 
considerable freedom, but always laboured to make
out their speculations to be in harmony with the
teachings of Mother Church, and really at heart
desired that they should be so.  It would not be
fair to accuse any of them of heresy, even though
it might appear that this or that utterance, pursued
through all its consequences, should end in 
contradicting one or other of the dogmas of faith.
The author had no mind to follow his statement
so far, and would not have owned that it led so far.
'To no author should there be imputed an opinion
false, or highly absurd, unless it be gathered 
expressly from his utterances, or follow evidently
from his utterances.' These are the words of
Scotus.<P>

Still it would not be right to regard Scholastic
Philosophy as a series of mere corollaries drawn
from articles of faith, mere dictates of dogmatic
theology. The subtlety and variety of Scholastic
disputation suffices to set aside such a view.
Schoolman differed from Schoolman; but men
agreed in one common faith do not differ on
conclusions following palpably and plainly therefrom, 
unless they be lamentably wanting in logic,
which the Schoolmen were not. Only as trains
get further from the starting-point do they lose
sight of one another's courses, and the difference
of the directions which they severally took from
the first widens between them. Philosophy may,
be applied to a dogma of faith; so was 
Scholasticism applied continually. As the application
was pressed and followed on, the Schoolmen
travelled wide of one another, nor did the Church
intervene to bring them together, so long as the
dogma from whence they started was not plainly
denied. But philosophy, as such, is not founded
upon dogma and revelation. It has its own principles, 
which are truths of intuitive reason; and it
proceeds upon facts of experience. It is a different
science from scholastic theology, nor is its whole
domain contained within or circumscribed by
theology. It does not stand to theology as the
county of Rutland to the rest of England, 
contained within it and circumscribed by it. Nor
are the frontiers of philosophy conterminous with
theology throughout their whole extent.  The
frontiers of England are not wholly conterminous
with those of Wales. All England does not
consist of the Welsh Marches. There is much
philosophy, many philosophical questions, having
nothing to do with theology.  To take an example
from Scholasticism: its central tenet of the 
composition of all things out of matter and form has
nothing to do with theology. The theory of
matter and form is due to Aristotle -- clearly
no Catholic. Many Catholic philosophers have
rejected and do reject matter and form.  It is
an open issue in philosophy, independent of faith;
and there are many such.<P>

<B>2. Dualism.</b>  All philosophers draw some 
distinction between the mind and the world which
it cognises; also, if they be theists, between God
and the world.  But many, perhaps most modern
philosophers, will not allow this distinction to be
a clear and deep line of cleavage.  They dream
of God and the world, they dream of the subject
perceiving and the object perceived, meeting in
what they call 'a higher unity.' That is to say,
modern philosophy is idealistic, monistic, 
pantheistic. Such, eminently, Scholasticism was not.
The ninth century pantheist, John Scotus
Eriugena, was no ancestor of the Scholastics.
To every genuine Schoolman, God was 'high
above all nations,' so high that the world in
comparison with God cannot be said to be at all.
In the sense in which God <i>is</i>, the world <i>is not</i>.
The world has being, indeed, 'analogous' to the
being of God, but infinitely inferior. The world
then is no emanation from God, no necessary
'shadow' cast by Godhead and projected outside
Itself: the world, so every Schoolman teaches,
owes its origin to a free volition of God, put forth
at the beginning of time, at a distance from
the present, remote, but not 
infinite;<A HREF="schnt44.htm">*</a> in other
words, the world was created out of nothing, and
owes its continued existence to the mere good
pleasure of its Creator. As God is above the
world, so the world is beyond and independent
of the knowing mind of man. The most pronounced 
feature of all Scholastic treatises is their
pronounced objectivity. The Scholastic mind
was bent on being, not on forms of thought or
constraining needs of believing. The difficulties
raised by Berkeley, Hume, and Kant, were not
difficulties to Albert or Thomas. He triumphed
over them by refusing to entertain them.  His
metaphysics went with his psychology, the
common psychology of human nature. Man
invincibly believes that he sees a world which
is no part of himself. That invincible belief
was to the Schoolman an axiomatic truth. He
never laboured to prove it: to him it was 
unprovable, because it was a primary datum of
his nature, and there was no going beyond it.
'In the process of understanding, the intellectual
impression received in the potential intellect is
that <i>whereby (quo)</i> we understand, as the impression 
of colour in the eye is not that <i>which (quod)</i>
is seen, but that <i>whereby (quo)</i> we see.  On the
other hand, that <i>which (quod)</i> is understood is
the nature of things existing outside the soul,
as also it is things existing outside the soul that
are seen with the bodily sight: for to this end
were arts and sciences invented, that things might
be known in their natures' (<i>Contra Gentiles</i>,
ii. 75). The distinction here drawn between
<i>quod</i> and <i>quo</i> founds the standing reply of
Scholasticism to Idealism. My consciousness
is not the object but the instrument of my
cognition.<P>

<B>3. Optimism.</b>  The Schoolman is a cheerful man:
he has a serene confidence in two things; (1) the
competence of the human mind to attain to truth
with certitude; (2) the general goodness of Being,
and of the tendencies of things. On the latter
point, of course, he was buoyed up by his faith,
that 'to them that love God, all things work
together unto good.' He never asked himself
whether life were worth living. With him it
was an axiom that Being is good, <i>omne ens est
bonum</i>; and Living Being still better, for there
was more of Being in it. He was utterly estranged
from that Asiatic philosophy which declares 
existence an evil, and the continuance of conscious
life a punishment for past sin. He was equally
opposed to Scepticism, and to that mild type of
Scepticism, called Traditionalism, which, presupposing 
the incompetence of human reason,
ascribes all human knowledge whatsoever of the
things of God 'to the faith once given to the
Saints of old.' The Schoolman venerated faith,
but he maintained that there was also a natural,
or rational, knowledge of God; and that sundry
truths of religion could be established by 
philosophical argument. As Scholasticism tended to
decay, the number of these truths, said to be
philosophically demonstrable, was diminished,
To Scotus they were fewer than to St. Thomas,
and to Ockham fewer than to Scotus. 'There
is, then, a twofold sort of truth in things divine
for the wise man to study; one that can be
attained by rational inquiry, another that transcends 
all the industry of reason. To the declaration 
of the first sort we must proceed by
demonstrative reasons that are likely to convince
the adversary. But because such reasons are
not forthcoming for truth of the second sort,
our aim ought not to be to convince the adversary 
by reasons, but to refute his reasonings
against the truth, which we may hope to do,
since natural reason cannot be contrary to the
truth of faith. There are, however, some probable
reasons available for the declaration of this truth,
to the exercise and consolation of the faithful,
but not to the convincing of opponents' (<i>Contra
Gentiles</i>, i. 9).<P>

<B>4. Static.</b>  Modern philosophy is the philosophy
of change, of phenomena, of perpetual flux.
Scholasticism is the philosophy of permanent
substantial being. Not that the Schoolmen
ignored change, but by preference they rested
upon complete existences and achieved results,
<i>e.g.</i> a perfect morality and a full-grown society,
not the development of either. Needless to say
how little 'substance'enters into modern thought:
it has become 'a bloodless category'; but it was
a full, round, plump entity to the Schoolman.
One word on Evolution.  The Schoolman, with
Aristotle, believed in <i>abiogenesis</i>, the development
of maggots and reptiles and fish out of mud and
decaying matter. They believed in the ontogenetic
evolution of the human embryo from mere vegetative 
life to the life of a brute animal, and thence to
the life of a rational being. 'The higher a form is
in the scale of being,' writes St. Thomas (<i>Contra
Gentiles</i>, ii. 89; <i>Of God and His Creatures</i>, p. 168),
'the more intermediate forms and intermediate
generations must be passed through before that
finally perfect form is reached. Therefore in the
generation of animal and man, these having the
most perfect form, there occur many intermediate
forms and generations, and consequently destructions, 
because the generation of one is the
destruction of another. The vegetative soul
therefore, which is first in the embryo, while it
lives the life of a plant, is destroyed, and there
succeeds a more perfect soul, which is at once
natural and sentient, and for that time the
embryo lives the life of an animal; upon the
destruction of this there ensues the rational soul,
infused from without.' St. Thomas here teaches
what is called <i>ontogenetic evolution</i>, the evolution
of the individual perfect animal from a lower
form. Of <i>phylogenetic evolution</i>, or the evolution
of species, he seems never to have thought. Yet
one who held <i>abiogenesis</i>, and, with the alchemists,
the transmutation of metals, to say nothing of
evolutionary potentialities (<i>rationes seminales</i>)
in primordial matter, which St. Thomas indeed
did not hold, but earlier Schoolmen did, such a
one could have had no strong <i>philosophical</i>
prejudice against the possibility of an evolution of
species. St. Thomas, with Aristotle, points out a
static series of gradations, or what has been
termed 'evolution in co-existence' in the following 
passage: 'A wonderful chain of beings is
revealed to our study.  The lowest member of
the higher genus is always found to border close
upon the highest member of the lower genus.
Thus some of the lowest members of the genus of
animals attain to little beyond the life of plants;
certain shell-fish, for example, have only the sense
of touch, and are attached to the ground like
plants. Hence Dionysius says: "Divine Wisdom
has joined the ends of the hioher to the begin-
nings of the lower"' (<i>Contra Gentiles</i>, ii. 68).
He has in view the series: plant, animal, man,
angel. But he did not derive plant, animal, and
man from a common ancestor.<P>

I may add two more marks of Scholasticism,
marks, the exaggeration of which went to bring
about its decay.  It was <i>legalist</i> and it was <i>a
priorist</i>. Law, even more than philosophy, was
the favourite pursuit of the mediaeval scholar.  A
knowledge of the canon and civil law was the
surest avenue to preferment and wealth.  Hence
arose a tendency to treat philosophy like law.
Aristotle was cut up into texts, which were quoted
like texts from the Pandects. A like use was
made of the Fathers and Holy Scripture, and, as
time went on, of the great Schoolmen who had
been before. The danger of this practice was a
neglect of context and spirit, and a losing sight of
the intrinsic grounds of the argument. 
Scholasticism was also <i>a priorist</i>, making out what must
be in the nature of things. Now it is easy to
make out what must be, to our minds, so far as
our knowledge goes and our hypothesis extends.  
The difficulty is in testing our hypothesis by
experiment and observation, and widening our
knowledge by research into actual facts, 
unfavourable as well as favourable to our preconceived 
theory. This rough and tough <i>a posteriori</i>
work was not much to the taste of some of
the Schoolmen, and their speculations suffered
accordingly.<P>
