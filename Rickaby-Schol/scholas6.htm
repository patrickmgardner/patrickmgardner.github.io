<hr><H1>Causes of  the Decay of Scholasticism</h1>

SCHOLASTICISM may be said to have decayed
because it no longer attracted the best intellects
of Europe. Men's thoughts came to be taken up
with other things -- with wars and the new growth
of nationalities, with the schism in the Papacy,
with the great scourge known as the Black Death,
with Greek art and literature, and that revival of
Graeco-Roman tastes known as the Renaissance;
with the theological questions raised by Luther
and Calvin about faith and predestination and
sacraments and papal power; and, when the
strifes of the Reformation were more or less 
composed, with Baconian and Newtonian physics,
finally, with the commercial interests awakened
by the discovery of the New World. Again,
though Scholasticism, <i>i.e.</i> Scholastic Philosophy,
is not theology, yet it was ever the attendant
(<i>ancilla</i>) of Catholic theology. The Schoolmen
were practically all Churchmen; you never find
a lay Doctor. Consequently, as the Catholic
Church lost ground, Scholasticism lost also. All
the manifold causes that led up to the Reformation 
were concurring causes likewise to the unmaking 
of Scholasticism.<P>

These, however, are extrinsic causes. An 
intrinsic cause must be sought, and the question
put: Was Scholasticism exhausted as a philosophy? 
Had it found out all that was to be
found out by its methods and on its presuppositions? 
Any answer attempted to this question
must be premature.  An <i>a priori</i> answer will not
do. The experiment is being tried with a new
Scholasticism, and we must abide the result.  Two
remarks may be made meanwhile: one as regards
the method of the ancient Scholasticism, the
other as regards its presuppositions. In point of
method the ancient Scholasticism lies open to the
charge of having been overmuch <i>a priori</i>, 
over-neglectful of experiment, of research, of observation 
of nature at first hand, of linguistic studies,
of history, of documentary evidence. As we have
seen, Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon nobly
rebut this charge.  Still, a system, like a personal
character, has the defects of its qualities; and if
the Schoolmen excelled, as they undoubtedly did
excel, in abstract reasoning, they must have been
under the temptation to neglect <i>a posteriori</i>
evidence. Theirs is not the only school that lies
open to this charge. Who shall say that 
Neo-Kantism has not been overmuch a priori?
Who shall deny that our German friends do at
times evolve prodigies and portents out of their
inner consciousness?<P>

Then as to presuppositions.  Some of the 
presuppositions of the ancient Scholasticism were
indubitably false. We refer of course to ancient
notions of physical science, and particularly of
astronomy. No one who has not read much of
Scholastic authors can conceive how far the
Ptolemaic astronomy entered into their psychology, 
their metaphysics, and even their theology.
Certainly Scholasticism does not stand or fall
with the Ptolemaic conception of nine concentric
crystal spheres, with the earth in the centre, one
sphere carrying the moon, another the sun, five
others a planet each, the eighth sphere all the
fixed stars, while the ninth was the <i>primum
mobile</i> imparting circular motion to all the 
rest.<A HREF="schnt66.htm">*</a>
One may remain a good Scholastic, and abolish
all that. Even St. Thomas had his doubts, at
least about the further developments of the plan --
the eccentrics and epicycles, invented to account
for the retrograde motions of the planets.  He
writes of these contrivances: 'The suppositions
that these astronomers have invented need not
necessarily be true; for perhaps the phenomena
of the stars are explicable on some other plan not
yet discovered by men' (in <i>Lib.</i> ii. <i>de Coelo</i>,
lect. 17).  'The reason alleged does not 
sufficiently prove the position; it only shows that
when the position is assumed, the effects follow
naturally. Thus in astronomy the system of
eccentrics and epicycles is argued from the fact
that the assumption enables us to explain the
sensible phenomena of the motions of the heavenly
bodies; this argument, however, falls short of a
convincing proof, for possibly the phenomena
might be explained on some other supposition'
(<i>Sum. Theol.</i>, i. q. 32, art. 1, ad. 2).
St. Thomas, nevertheless, like the other Schoolmen, 
built upon the Ptolemaic astronomy a whole
system of Providential government of the world.
An angel by Divine command moved the outer
sphere, the <i>primum mobile</i>; that moved the
other spheres; and the spheres between them
<i>influenced</i> (they did not altogether effect) all the
changes that take place in the sublunary world,
short of man, and many changes in the body of
man himself. The Schoolmen refused to attribute 
all that goes on upon earth to the influence
of the heavenly spheres: first, because they stood
up for free will in man; secondly, because they
saw (what not all philosophers have seen) that to
deny all activity to material substances on earth,
and reduce them to pure passivity, was tantamount 
to abolishing them out of existence;
thirdly, because, holding the course of events in
the sublunary world to be contingent and variable,
they would not ascribe it to a necessary cause,
such as they took the motion of the heavenly
spheres to be.<A HREF="schnt68.htm">*</a>
Although for the accidents of his body, and his
relations with material things, man came under
the influence of the spheres, yet for his will and
understanding he came under a peculiar Providence. 
His will was directly moved by God
(<i>Contra Gentiles</i>, iii. 89). How St. Thomas 
understood this divine motion of the will became the
theme of contention between Thomist and Molinist
in the sixteenth century. St. Thomas curiously
shrank from asserting a direct influence of God
upon the understanding of man, apparently
because he was reluctant to play into the hands
of Avicenna and Averroes (<i>Contra Gentiles</i>, ii.
74, 76: <i>Of God and His Creatures</i>, pp. 142, 143,
148). St. Thomas therefore holds that our 
understanding learns of God through the angels. Thus
elections and motions of wills are immediately
disposed by God; human intellectual knowledge
is guided by God through the intermediate agency
of angels; while bodily things that serve man,
whether within or without his body, are 
administered by God through the intermediation of
angels and of the heavenly spheres' (<i>Contra
Gentiles</i>, iii. 91).<P>

The heavenly spheres have melted into thin air,
tooether with all scholastic speculations founded
upon them. Concerning angels, every one 
conversant with the writings of the Schoolmen is
aware how large a proportion of their pages is
filled with discussion of these pure immaterial
'forms.' The fountainheads of such discussion
were (a) Scripture, (b) Neo-Platonism, (c) the
human intellect taken as a basis for <i>a priori</i>
speculation what a pure intellect must be. All
the Schoolmen much insisted on the distinction
between intellect and sense.  Pure sensation
made the brute, pure intellect the angel, and
man was the link between. Modern thought
attends curiously to the brute creation, and to
the physiology of the human body; it believes
in experimental psychology; it never attempts
to contemplate intellect apart from brain and
nerves. On grounds of pure reason, it asks,
what have we that can be called knowledge even
of the very existence of angels? The angels
have taken flight from Catholic schools of philosophy; 
the rustle of their wings is caught by
the theologian's ear alone. Whether philosophy
has lost by their departure, it is not for these
pages to say. St. Thomas would have counted
it a loss. The angels entered essentially into
his scheme of the cosmos, and were indispensable
transmitters of thought to human kind. 'Our
intellectual knowledge,' he says, 'must be regulated 
by the knowledge of the angels' (<i>Contra
Gentiles</i>, iii. 91). Modern Psychology is serenely
oblivious of the fact. Catholics, no doubt, still
believe in angels, dread the evil ones (devils),
and pray to the good ones who now see the face
of God. Catholics also believe that good angels
are often the vehicles through which 'actual grace,'
that is, warnings and impulses in order to salvation, 
descends from God to men. But that man
owes his ordinary knowledge of matheniatics,
chemistry, sanitation, railway management, to
any action whatever of angelic intelligence upon
his mind -- is there any man living who thinks
so? If all that St. Thomas meant was that we
should try to penetrate beyond the surface
evidence of the senses, that is what every
scientific man endeavours to do in his view of
nature -- to see <i>e.g.</i> in a bar of iron what a pure
intelligence would see there, that is the effort of
science. But St. Thomas meant more than that
(cf. <i>Of God and His Creatures</i>, p. 252), and some
are beginning, to suspect that he is right.
One word on the process of formation of
universal concepts, as laid down by the Schoolmen. 
The impression made on the sense by
the sensible object is universalised by the 'active
intellect,' or, if you will, by the activity of the
intellect. So universalised, it is received in the
'potential intellect,' or in the potentiality of the
intellect. Thus universalised and received, it is
called <i>species intelligibilis impressa</i>.  There can
be no <i>species impressa</i> except in presence of the
object.  But, further, the mind recognises, and
as it were confirms, and stores up even away
from its object, the species. So recognised and
adopted, the species, or impression, becomes what
is called <i>species intelligibilis expressa</i>, or <i>verbum
mentale</i> (the mind's word). By the <i>verbum
mentale</i> the mind says to itself of the <i>species</i>,
'that's it.' See for further elucidation Dr.Maher's
<i>Psychology</i>, ed. 4, pp. 306-313; <i>Of God and His
Creatures</i>, pp. 38, 122. This theory is too purely
Psychical to be affected by physical science.<P>

The Scholastics of the seventeenth century,
unfortunately, refused to reconsider anything.
They saw no possibility of any accommodation
of the Scholastic philosophy and the new physical
theories that were riveting the attention of the
world.  They were too timid to declare, what to
us is a truism, that metaphysics and psychology
have absolutely nothing to do with astronomy.
Their schools had flourished, they considered,
under planetary influences, and under planetary
influences they should remain.  The adventurous
comet of 1618, is Boileau sarcastically wrote,
was to be recalled within the concavity of the
moon, and forbidden to go spying out the
mysteries of the higher heavens. Very other
was the attitude of Albertus Magnus and Thomas
Aquinas and Friar Bacon to the physical science
of their day.  Poor science it was, no doubt, but
they took care to have the best of it, the most
recent, what was then the most assured. And
they took, care not to lean too much upon the
uncertainties of physics, as is proved by the fact
that their metaphysical system can be detached
from the Aristotelian physics with which it was
so closely interlinked. The possibility of this
separation the seventeenth-century Schoolmen
did not discern; they loathed the new learning,
and their old learning became a byword of contempt.  
How many educated men still derive
their notion of a Doctor of Scholastic Philosophy
from Moli&egrave;re!
