<H1>Decay of Scholasticism</h1>

<B>1. Ockham and the Terminists.</b>

WILLIAM OCKHAM, 1280-1347, 'the Venerable
Master,'<A HREF="schnt51.htm">*</a> 
'the Invincible Doctor,' of the Order of
St. Francis, born at Ockham in Surrey, studied at
Merton College, Oxford; heard Duns Scotus in
the University of Paris, seems himself to have
taught at Oxford: was certainly lecturing in
Paris 1320-1323; then quitted his chair to turn
ecclesiastical Radical at the court of Louis of
Bavaria, and write bitter things against Pope
John XXII.  Ockham reopened the question on
Universal Ideas, which had been closed for a
hundred years. It is wrong to call Ockham
a Nominalist; that is to say, he by no means
denied the existence of Universal Ideas in the
mind.  What he did deny was that they stood
for an thing specifically common to a multitude
of individuals: he argued that they stood for
all the individuals to whom they were applicable.  
He says: 'What is predicated [generically] of many
things differing in species is not aught that is of
the being of the things predicated, but is one idea
in the mind, naturally signifying all the things of
which it is predicated.' To judge of this, let us
revert to the familiar logical distinction between
the 'extension' of an idea, or what Mill calls the
'denotation' of a name, and the 'comprehension'
of the idea, or 'connotation' of the name.  Extension 
and denotation take in the individuals to
which the idea or name is applicable. Comprehension 
and connotation take in the notes constituent 
of the idea, or what is commonly called
the 'meaning,' of the name in predication.
Ockham was too acute to be blind to this 
distinction. We must not understand him as setting
aside comprehension and connotation entirely.
What he does commit himself to in the passage
quoted is the assertion that only in denotation
does our predication extend itself to things outside
the mind of the speaker, namely, to the individuals
spoken of. What is said of those individuals, in
other words, the comprehension or connotation,
'is not aught that is of the being of the things,'
it is 'one idea in the mind.' That is to say,
Ockham was a Conceptualist.  Thus 'men are
animals,' meant to him, 'John, Robert, etc., are
animals.' But why call them 'animals'? It is
a class-name, a convenient label for the lot. But
does the label tell us anything? does it connote or
mean anything? Yes, says Ockbam, it connotes
an idea in my mind, an idea of animality resolvable
into notes, such as life and sensibility, which again
are my ideas.  To St. Thomas, and Realists of all
shades, this is not enough. It would convert all
our predication, and consequently all our science,
into an imposing of our own ideas upon objects
of nature. To the comprehension of a Universal
Idea, they say, there must be something <i>in rerum
natura</i> answering.  That something, Moderate
Realists say, is made up of certain attributes,
existing separately in every member of the class,
yet in each typical of the whole class.<P>

Ockham's doctrine is known as Terminism.
His numerous followers are known as Terminists.
They were powerful in the Schools to the end
of the fifteenth century.  Terminism is not
Nominalism: for <i>terminus</i> in Ockham is not
what we call a <i>term</i> or <i>name</i>; it is the <i>universal 
concept</i> itself, considered as a <i>sign of many
things (signum plurium)</i>, namely, of all the
individuals to which it applies. Terminism means
Conceptualism. Though a Conceptualist, however, 
Ockham was not an Idealist. His Dualism
was as distinct as that of the other Schoolmen.
He held that we have an intuitive knowledge of
individual things; that the first thing known is
the individual, a thing existing in real truth
outside the mind.<P>

Ockham was a great enemy of formalism, or
the multiplication of distinctions, so much affected
by Scotus. His saying, 'It is idle to do by many
things what may be done by fewer' (<i>frustra fit
per plura, quod potest fieri per 
pauciora</i>),'<A HREF="schnt54.htm">*</a> has
gone down to posterity in the form, 'Entities are
not to be multiplied beyond necessity' (<i>entia non
sunt multiplicanda praeter necessitatem</i>), known
in the schools as 'Ockham's razor.'
Ockham followed Scotus in diminishing the
number of religious truths that can be proved
by reason, so throwing more burden upon faith.
The danger to religion in this process is that,
carried to extremity, it would argue that faith
points one way and reason another. This was
the position of the later Averroists, though not
perhaps of Averroes himself, that a thing may
be true in theology but false in philosophy -- the
position known as that of the 'two truths.' The
main position of Averroes, that of the unity of
the intellect, Ockham abhorred, as he abhorred
every vestige of the universal <i>in rerum natura</i>.
In the Bodleian Library is a quaint old book,
printed in 1487, the <i>Quodlibeta</i> (we should say
the 'Miscellanies') of William Ockham. These
are some of the questions: 'Whether it can be
proved by reason that there is only one God?'
[answer -- 'No, if by "God" you understand "that
which is nobler and better than anything else."']
'Whether an angel can move locally.' Whether
one angel can converse with another.' Whether
an angel can move through vacuum' [answer -- 
'Yes']. 'Whether it can be shown evidently that
the intellectual soul is the form of the body'
[answer -- 'No,' against St. Thomas]. 'Whether it
can be shown evidently that there is not numerically 
one intellect for all men' [answer -- 'Yes,'
against Averroes]. 'Whether the exterior act
has a goodness or malice of its own' [answer -- 
No'].<P>

Ockham's worst error in philosophy was his
making moral distinctions dependent upon the
will of God.  If this principle is pushed to the
length of saying that the sole reason why anything 
is right or wrong, fair or good, reasonable or
unreasonable, true or false, is because God has so
willed it to be, it involves the ruin of Ethics,
indeed of all philosophy.<P>

Ockham in his later life was lamentably 
disobedient to the authority which he had vowed to
obey. But his philosophical writing is shrewd
and suggestive. As there were Thomists and
Scotists and Averroists, so there were also
Ockhamites (Terminists), to the downfall of
Scholasticism.<P>

<B>2. Two Knight-errants of Scholasticism.</b>

Raymund Lully, 1235-1315, 'the Enlightened
Doctor,' also a Franciscan, but of a very different
type from Ockham, was stoned to death by Moors
at Tunis, and but for his extraordinary writings
might have merited the honours of canonisation.
His ruling passion in life was the conversion of
Moors and the putting down of Averroism. Taking 
an opposite line to Duns Scotus and Ockham,
and agreeing so far with Scotus Eriugena, he
maintained that all the truths of religion are
demonstrable by reason, even its mysteries. This
assertion, however, he counterbalanced by another,
that intellectual knowledge, if not exactly of all
things, at least of all things best worth knowing,
presupposes faith; and as knowledge mounts,
faith mounts with it, above it, apart from it, as oil
ever rises above water, to use his favourite 
comparison. We must not press this statement too
far, for Raymund can scarcely have denied all
knowledge to men destitute of faith. These
two paradoxical statements of Raymund must be
taken together, if the author is to be fairly judged.
Both may be, indeed both are, absurd, yet not
so absurd as either would be in isolation from the
other.  We have here an excellent instance of
the injustice that may be perpetrated by quotation. 
One should rummage an author through
to find whether sayings that offend us may
not be counteracted and explained, or limited,
by other sayings, or whether they do really
indicate the main unqualified drift of the writer's
thought.<P>

Raymund's notion of the essential presupposition 
of faith to knowledge may be accounted for
in this way. He wrote as a Catholic. Now, in
matters touching religion, a Catholic always
argues with prepossessions in favour of faith
interwoven with his rational first principles. A
confirmed unbeliever has similar prepossessions in
favour of unbelief. Thus, though both appeal to
reason, they may reason for eternity and never
will agree.<P>

To facilitate that philosophic deduction in
which he was so earnest a believer, Raymund
invented a 'calculating machine.' Letters and
geometrical figures, revolved and combined
together, represented the various elements of
Scholasticism; and the combinations thus 
produced suggested syllogisms.  Such a machine
may co-ordinate ideas, but it does not give them;
and the very coordinations are apt to be fortuitous 
and arbitrary.<P>

In his view of the interpenetration of faith and
and science Lully had followers, among others
the celebrated Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, 1401-1464. 
Nicholas Chrypffs was born at Kues, or
Cusa, near Treves. An opponent of papal power at
the Council of Basle, he became afterwards its
most ardent champion and most efficient minister.  
Nicholas V created him Cardinal and Bishop of
Brixen. In an active life he found time for
philosophy. His great work is entitled <i>Of
Learned Ignorance (De docta ignorantia)</i>, an
expression borrowed of St. Bonaventure. He
dwells on our inability to understand God and
the essences of things. We cannot understand
those essences, because we cannot understand
Him who contains them all. Our highest learning 
is the avowal of this ignorance. Cusa writes
of God much as modern writers have written of
the Absolute.  God is <i>coincidentia oppositorum</i>,
inasmuch as in Him all contradictions are
reconciled.  God is <i>complicatio omnium</i>, as in
Him the multitude of things is brought to a
higher unity. What is implicit in God, becomes
explicit in the universe. God created primordial
matter, but as that cannot exist by itself (as
St. Thomas also teaches), God must be considered
the form of all things (denied by St. Thomas,
<i>Contra Gentiles</i>, i. 26). To save himself from
pantheism, which he disavows, Cusa explains that
God is in the creature as the prototype of its
reality. Then He must be the form exemplar,
not the form constituent.<P>

Cusa's 'learned ignorance' may be regarded
either in respect of God, or in respect of the things
of this universe. In the latter respect, so far as
physical science goes, the best physicists now echo
his words. The generalisations of physical science
are not final, absolute, adequate; they are 
provisional colligations of facts already discovered,
put together under a formula which seems most
likely to lead to discovery of further facts. They
are working hypotheses, not unfounded in the
past, full of promise for the future. But in the
future they may be discarded, and other colligations, 
tying together new discoveries, will help the
inquirer to still further research. Even to the
end of time, the ultimate nature of things seems
likely to remain a mystery.  Who shall finally
say what is electricity, or what is life ?
To say that God is the union of opposites,
sanely understood, as we must suppose Cusa to
have meant it, does not mean that such opposites
as sweet and bitter are <i>formally</i> in God, else they
would remain opposite, and be incompatible; but
that they are in Him <i>eminently</i>, as in their
exemplar and efficient cause.  Though God is
absolutely one, no sooner does He begin to be
copied by creatures, placed by Him outside Himself, 
than plurality sets in. God is one, but
virtually manifold. He is complete actuality in
Himself, but in His creatures He is capable of
infinite potential expansion, this expansion of
Him in creation ever falling infinitely short of
that great, all-perfect Exemplar, which is God
Himself.  All this should be borne in mind in
reading Nicholas of Cusa.<P>

In his earlier writings St. Thomas delighted in
insisting, as Cusa does, on the negative character
of our knowledge of God.  He has a chapter
(<i>Contra Gentiles</i>, i. 14) 'that in order to a 
knowledge of God we must use the method of negative
differentiation (<i>via remotionis</i>),' <i>i.e.</i> telling what
God is not. 'By such negations He will be
further and further distinguished from everything
besides Himself, and then there will be a proper
notion of His substance, when He shall be known
as distinct from all; still it will not be a perfect
knowledge, for He will not be known for what He
is in Himself.' Again, 'we cannot take in of God
what He is, but what He is not, and how other
beings are related to Him' (<i>Ib.</i>, i. 30). Again
(iii. 49) he quotes pseudo-Dionysius as saying:
'We are united with God as with the Unknown';
and explains, 'which comes about in this way,
that we know of God what He is not, but what
He is remains absolutely unknown (<i>penitus 
incognitum</i>).' In later life St. Thomas wrote more
cautiously on this subject. He says in the
<i>Summa Theologiae</i> (p. 1, q. 13, art. 2): 'Of the
names that are predicated of God absolutely and
affirmatively, as 'good,''wise,' and the like, some
have said that all such names are invented rather
to remove something from God than to posit anything 
in Him. But this account is unsatisfactory.
And therefore we must say otherwise, that such
lines do signify the divine substance, but fail to
represent it perfectly.'<A HREF="schnt62.htm">*</a><P>

Later Schoolmen complete this teaching by
observing that while names that connote 
imperfection, as 'earth,' 'dull,' 'animal,' in no way
apply to God; names significant of pure perfection,
as 'wise,' 'just,' do apply to Him, and that after a
more excellent fashion than they apply to any
creature. God is <i>wise</i>, but not under the limitations 
of human wisdom.  He is <i>just</i> with such
justice as befits the Supreme Being, and so of the
rest. If St. Thomas, Cardinal Cusa, or other
Schoolmen, sometimes are reluctant to allow our
having <i>positive</i> knowledge of God, what they wish
to deny is our having <i>adequate</i> and <i>univocal</i>
knowledge of Him. We know Him only through
imperfect analogies.<P>

Cusa deserves to count among the Schoolmen.  
He was a dualist, although at times verging on
pantheism. He was observant of Catholic orthodoxy. 
He held to matter and form. After him
we may mention one who has been called 'the
last of the Schoolmen,' Gabriel Biel, 1425-1495.  
His <i>Collectorium</i>, well known and often edited,
contains nothing original, but is justly considered
one of the most methodical and faithful expositions 
of the 'terminism' of William Ockham.  In
Ockham and Terminism, and worse still, in 
Compendiums of Terminism, Scholasticism pined
away. Humanism and the Renaissance, 
Neo-Platonism, Averroism, Cartesianism, and finally
Physical Science, reigned in her stead.<P>
