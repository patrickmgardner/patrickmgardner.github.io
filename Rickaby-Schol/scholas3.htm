<H1>Scholasticism in the Thirteenth Century</h1>
<B>1. The Library of the thirteenth-century Schoolman.</b>

IN judging of the Schoolmen we must remember
how destitute they were of those instruments of
study and research without which any modern
student would consider the progress of his work
impossible.  Not that the privation was altogether
a dead loss.  Devoid of helps from without, men
thought harder. For physics they depended
upon their unaided senses. No telescope, no
microscope, no battery, no chemical re-agents;
no museums nor collections either. For the
literary student there were books, manuscript of
course. He had in his hands, and by frequent
quotation showed his diligent use of, most of the
Latin Classics, Cicero, Virgil, Horace, Terence,
Juvenal, Seneca, Quintilian.  Pliny's Natural
History be knew at least by extracts. Knowing
no Greek, as we have said, he had in his 
book-chest no Greek manuscripts.  Supreme importance
is therefore attached to the translations of
Aristotle: indeed it is not too much to say that
had Aristotle never been put into Latin, scholastic
philosophy never would have arisen. Ab&eacute;lard in
1136 had in his hands translations of what was
quaintly entitled the <i>Perihermenias</i> (Aristotle on
Interpretation) and the <i>Categories</i>. The second
half of that same century possessed the whole
of the <i>Organon</i>, but no more. Had you asked
a clerk of our own King John's Court who
Aristotle was, he would have answered with a
shrug of the shoulders, 'Oh, a crabbed logician.'
The throne of the Stagirite was not yet firmly
planted in the West. By the middle of the
thirteenth century, however, besides versions from
the Arabic, a translation from the Greek of nearly
the whole of Aristotle was achieved by two Dominicans, 
Henry of Brabant and William of Moerbeke.
<A HREF="schnt10.htm">*</a>  All that the Schoolmen had of Plato
was a fragment of the <i>Timaeus</i>, translated by
Chalcidius, also the <i>Phaedo</i> and <i>Meno</i>: further
information about the philosopher was gathered
from St. Augustine and sundry Neo-Platonists.  
Chief of these latter was the Pseudo-Dionysius
the Areopagite (probably a monk of the sixth
century), whose treatises <i>Of the Divine Names</i>
and <i>Of the Heavenly Hierarchy</i> had a great hold
on the mediaeval mind.  A still greater treasure
was the works of Boethius, who was long the
chief authority on Aristotle. Many fragments of
the ancient learning were found embedded in the
works of the Latin Fathers, notably St. Augustine,
St. Ambrose, St. Gregory the Great, St. Isidore,
Lactantius, and Latin versions of Clement of
Alexandria and Origen. There was also a sort of
Cyclopoedia, the work of Martianus Capella, bearing
the strange title of <i>The Nuptials of Mercury and
Philologia</i>.  Last but not least, diligently conned
over and continually transcribed, there was the
Bible according to the Latin Vulgate.<P>

<B>2. The topics of scholastic disputation.</b>

Scholasticism was a thing made at Universities,
made at Oxford and elsewhere, but above all in
the great University of Paris, the Athens of the
Middle Ages.  Throughout the forty days of
Lent the candidate for the Bachelor's degree
'determined'; that is, put forward propositions
and defended them against opponents.  Then
two or three years' study, and more 'determining,'
converted him into a Licentiate. Further delay
and further disputation saw him at last a Master    
or Doctor of the Sorbonne, the highest intellectual 
distinction which the world had to bestow.<A HREF="schnt12.htm">*</a>  
The 'determinations' which carried the persevering 
student finally up to the Master's Chair
presented lists of propositions of which these
may serve as specimens: -- 'There are [or there
are not] in primordial matter (<i>materia prima</i>)
special aptitudes of being (<i>rationes seminales</i>).'
'The rational soul is [or is not] the only form
in man.'  'There is not [or there is] a real
distinction between the soul and its faculties.'
Reading over the propositions, one sees at a
glance that the Schoolmen were not all of one
mind in philosophy: in fact they disputed with
one another fiercely and in grim earnest. At the
same time it is difficult for our minds to see the
points at issue.<P>

     But what they fought each other for,<BR>
     I never could make out.<P>

The gauge on which the mediaeval mind ran
was not our modern gauge. Which of the two is
broad, and which is narrow, we need not argue:
anyhow the gauge is different, and the passage
of the train of thought from the one to the other
is a troublesome operation. Whatever difficulty
we experience in making out the Schoolman's
objective, we shall be wise in presuming that he
had some real question before him, and that the
disputations in mediaeval Paris and Oxford were
not as Moli&egrave;re has represented them, mere wars
of words.<P>

All scholastic philosophy is based upon the
distinction between <i>matter</i> and <i>form</i>.  Modern
thought makes light of the distinction. But we
must absolutely attend to it, if we are to have
any notion of Scholasticism at all. Likewise we
must bear in mind the distinction of <i>substance</i>
and <i>accident</i>.  According to the Schoolmen,
substance alone fully is: accident has but a
diminished being, inhering in substance.  The
idealism of our day abolishes substance, or 
'permanent being' altogether, and recognises accident,
not as anything permanently 'inhering' (for there
is nothing left to inhere in), but as a fleeting 'state
of consciousness.' Substance to the Schoolmen
being something determinate, definitely this and
not <i>that</i> (what they with Aristotle called <i>hoc
aliquid</i>), they distinguished in it two constituents,
the <i>determinable</i>, which they called <i>matter</i>, and
the <i>determinant</i>, which they called form. 
According to the distinction of substance and
accident, they distinguished forms <i>substantial</i>
and <i>accidental</i>. All accidents are forms, but not
all forms are accidents. There is <i>substantial
form</i>, that determinant which makes the thing
to be what it is, and in the absence of which it
would cease to be; whereas an <i>accidental form</i>
may be removed without the thing perishing.
Lustre, for example, is an accidental form of gold,
for gold still remains gold, even though it has
grown dim. What was the substantial form of
gold a Schoolman would not venture to say: he
had not yet analysed material substance into its
essential components in detail, nor have we either.
The alchemists laboured at finding out the 
substantial form of gold.<P>

Most interesting of all created substances were
the substances of man and angel. Of angels,
the Schoolmen, prompted by Holy Scripture and
Neo-Platonism, said many curious things.  The
later Schoolmen took them for pure forms: others
attributed to them some sort of <i>matter</i>, not,
however, body. But the most perfect type of
<i>form</i>, in the scholastic sense, was the human
soul.  The soul <i>informs</i> the body, which is its
<i>matter</i>:<A HREF="schnt15.htm">*</a>   
the soul is not merely the prime mover
of the body, as is the boatman of the boat -- that
was the Platonic conception of human nature --
but the Schoolmen hold with Aristotle that the
soul is the prime constituent of the body; soul
and body make one entity, one nature, one
principle of action. 'Body and soul are not two
actually existing substances, but out of the two
of them is made one substance actually existing:
for a man's body is not the same in actuality
when the soul is present as when it is absent:
it is the soul that gives actual being' (St. Thomas
Aquinas, <i>Contra Gentiles</i>, ii. 69).<P>

A substance may have any number of <i>accidental
forms</i> corresponding to its various accidental
qualities.  Here the substance itself stands for the
<i>matter</i>.  Here, too, the <i>matter</i> is of a higher and
nobler order of being than the form; that is, than
the <i>accidental form</i>. But the <i>substantial form</i>
is nobler than the <i>matter</i> to which it gives being.
Hereupon we come to a prime debate among the,
thirteenth-century Schoolmen: <i>Can a substance
have more than one substantial form?</i> And
notably, <i>besides the soul, are there other 
substantial forms in the human body?</i> The
affirmative to this question was called the doctrine of
the <i>plurality of forms</i>. The negative was held
by St. Thomas in the teeth of much opposition.
His adversaries actually procured the condemnation 
of his doctrine of the <i>unity of form</i> by the
ecclesiastical authorities both at Paris and at
Oxford. In the end St. Thomas triumphed. His
opponents pleaded for further forms of what they
called 'corporeity'; and asked how it was, if the
soul alone gave being to the body, that the body
did not fall into nothingness at death. Another
phase of the difficulty is revealed in the light of
modern biology.  The lowest types of animal life
present to our inspection a few neurones, 
or nerve-cells, with nerves and muscular fibres 
corresponding. When we examine the human body, we find
similar neurones and fibres repeated, only in vastly
greater number and complexity. Has each of
these neurones a life of its own, that is to say, a
<i>form</i> of its own, for the form is the life? Is the
soul then a sort of President of a Republic of
forms, or is that dominant life and form, which
we call the soul, the one life and substantial form
of the human body? Professor M'Dougall lays
it down: 'Each nerve-cell, or <i>neurone</i> as it is now
commonly called, is, so far as the maintenance of
the vital processes of nutrition and growth are
concerned, a self-contained individual, not an
independent individual but a member of a very
complex society, the cells of the whole body'
(<i>Physiological Psychology</i>, Temple Primer, p. 24).
What would St. Thomas have said to that? I do
not judge the question: I merely state it to show
that Scholasticism was not that farrago of 
puerilities which a hasty observer might take it for,
but that, in their own way and with the means
of research at their command, the Schoolmen
busied themselves with many problems that still
fasten the interest of philosophers.<P>

One most remarkable theme of scholastic 
ingenuity was primordial matter (<i>materia prima</i>).  
Many jokes have been levelled against it, but
primordial matter is no laughing matter to any
one who understands it. To begin with, 
primordial matter is not sheer and mere nothing.
Were it so, the whole material universe would
lapse into nothingness: for of primordial matter
the said universe is composed. Primordial matter
is simply matter devoid of any substantial form.
In that state of isolation matter is never found.
St. Thomas holds that it absolutely could not
exist in such isolation. Matter can by no power
be isolated from all form. On the other hand,
form cannot exist without matter, except possibly
in the angel -- certainly not in the material universe.
<A HREF="schnt18.htm">*</a>  The earlier Scholasticism, however --
sometimes called Augustinianism -- did not take
primordial matter to be altogether formless, but
ascribed to it certain radical predispositions (called
<i>rationes seminales</i>) to turn into <i>this</i> substance
in preference to <i>that</i>. The notion of primordial
matter came from Aristotle, who seems to have had
it suggested to his mind by the <i>Timaeus</i> of Plato.  
What suggests primordial matter in the <i>Timaeus</i>
is the primitive chaos, which was from eternity,
ere Mind supervened to reduce it to an orderly
world. In the systems of later philosophers
primitive chaos was denuded more and more of
attributes till it passed into the formless, wholly
indeterminate and potential <i>materia prima</i> of
St. Thomas.<P>

'Faculty psychology' is derided in these days.  
The Schoolmen made much of it, and debated
among themselves whether any real, or objectively
valid, distinction can be drawn between the soul
and its faculties. Such distinction was held by
the later Scholastics: earlier writers of the School
denied it.  The morbid multiplication of personalities 
in the 'Beauchamp case,' and similar cases,
so interesting to our pathologists, tells rather in
favour of the later view, which St. Thomas
strongly maintained, that the faculties are really
distinct from one another and from the soul.  
The later mediaeval mystics made much of the
<i>substance</i> of the soul (<i>fundus animae</i> they
called it) as distinct from the <i>faculties</i>: in that
substance, as in His inner sanctuary, they 
maintained that God dwelt by His grace. Professor
James, in his peculiar psychology, claims a similar
dignity for what he terms 'the subliminal self'<P>

'The principle of individuation,' i.e. that
whereby a thing is its own singular self, and
not the universal specific nature of the species to
which it belongs -- that whereby Jones is Jones,
and not man in general -- must seem to an 
unscholastic mind a quaint conceit.  Like most
difficulties in philosophy, it grows by thinking,
and is no difficulty at all to the irreflective mind.
A first solution might be this: as the universal
cannot exist in its universality, but every 
existence must be singular, the existence of the thing
itself is the principle of its individuation. But,
replies the Thomist Schoolman, a thing can only
be individualised by having an individual essence;
now the existence even of an existing thing is
really distinct from its existing essence; you
must seek the principle of individuation 
somewhere in the essence; existence, being no part of
the essence of the thing, cannot be its principle of
individuation. The essence of a thing consists of
its matter and form.  Form cannot be the principle
of individuation, for form is a principle of 
perfection. If a perfection is to be limited, so as to be
multiplied and repeated in many instances, the
principle of limit must be sought elsewhere than
in the perfection itself.  The multiplication only
can take place through the reception of the form
into portions of matter.  Matter then must be the
principle of individuation.  Not, however, matter
in a state of absolute indetermination, not 
primordial matter simply, but 'matter marked by
quantity'; for, apart from relation to quantity,
there can be no such thing as 'portions of matter,'
and hence no individuation by reception into
distinct portions.<A HREF="schnt20.htm">*</a>   
'Matter,' says St. Thomas,
'considered in itself is indistinguishable; only
inasmuch as it is distinguishable can it come to
individualise the form received into it.  For form
is not individualised by being received in matter,
except in so far as it is received <i>in this matter or
that matter, distinct and determinate here and
now.</i>  Now matter is not divisible except by
quantity' (<i>Opusc. in Boeth.</i>, q. 4, a. 8). The 
conclusion is that laid down above, that form is
individualised by 'matter marked by quantity,'
<i>materia quantitate signata</i>.<P>

This conclusion of St. Thomas was by no means
received in the School with unanimity.  St. 
Bonaventure looks to both matter and form together
for the principle of individuation. Others placed
the principle in a negation, inherent in each 
substance, marking it off from every other.  To Duns
Scotus the principle was positive, an aptitude of
the final form to assume such and such 
individuality. The discussion lies far off the track of
modern thought. To appreciate it, one needs long
familiarity with the scholastic concepts of Matter
and Quantity. Remembering that, the principle,
whatever it be, marks off, not species from species
(which is done by the logical <i>differentia</i>), but
individual from individual within the same
species, whose specific essence is logically 
common, we may note that the soul of one man is
individualised from the soul of another, according
to St. Thomas, by the habitude which it bears to
this <i>particular body</i>, this particular <i>matter</i> 
-- which it is apt to <i>inform</i>, and not that,
<A HREF="schnt22.htm">*</a> a doctrine
which falls in happily with the 'heredity' of
modern science, whereby man is marked off from
man even from his mother's womb.<P>

The principle of individuation belongs to 
metaphysics.  Its psychological obverse is the question
of the cognition by intellect of things singular
and individual.  As whatever Midas touched
turned to gold, so whatever intellect touches, it
universalises, and, bursting beyond the individual,
attains to the type. How ever then can intellect
be cognisant of the individual? The Schoolmen
found an easy and no doubt a correct answer.
Sensory perception is not of the universal, in the
first place, but of the individual.  Man knows
individual things through his senses.  'The human
soul takes cognisance of the universal and of the
singular by two principles, sense [of the singular]
and intellect [of the universal]' (<i>Contra Gentiles</i>,
ii. 100).  The Schoolmen laboured much, and
differed among themselves, how the pure intellect
of the angel can be cognisant of individually 
existing objects.  Likewise they had a hard fight with
the Arabian commentators of Aristotle, who would
have confined the knowledge of God to the 
universal and ideal order. These difficulties about
God and the angels we must leave.  Enough has
been said to give the reader some idea of the
preoccupations of the scholastic mind.<P>

<B>3. The great Schoolmen of the Thirteenth Century.</b>

Peter the Lombard, surnamed the Master of
the Sentences, died bishop of Paris in 1160. His
work, called <i>Sentences</i>, not very profound and
not very original, had the good fortune to become
the favourite text-book in the schools, and kept
its place for centuries.  It is divided into four
books, on God, on Creatures, on Virtues and
Beatitude, on Sacraments. The four books of St.
Thomas <i>Contra Gentiles</i> pretty closely correspond.
Alexander of Hales, so called from the place
of his birth, Hales in Gloucestershire, a locality
no longer identifiable,<A HREF="schnt23.htm">*</a>   
a Franciscan, was a Master
in the University of Paris, and died in 1245,
leaving behind him a <i>Sum of Theology</i>, still
extant.  Alexander perfected the scholastic
method of treatment, which is, first to propose
a question, then state various arguments pointing 
to a solution opposite to your own, then to
give your own solution, and finally to refute the
arguments to the contrary. Alexander stands to
St. Bonaventure as Albertus Magnus to St.
Thomas. In either case the disciple has 
outshone the master.<P>

John of Fidansa, known as St. Bonaventure
(1221-1274), 'the Seraphic Doctor,' a Franciscan,
studied and taught in the University of Paris
from 1242 to 1257, being admitted a Master in
the last year of his residence. That same year he
became General of his Order, and in 1273 was
created Cardinal Bishop of Ostia, dying at the
Council of Lyons in the year following. His
extant works fill nine volumes. He was a 
personal friend of St. Thomas Aquinas, from whom
he differs by making more of the will than of the
understanding; by being conservative rather than
an innovator in philosophy; by not allowing the
angels to be pure forms; by allowing a plurality
of substantial forms, one, however, dominant
over the rest, in the same being; by ascribing to
primordial matter some radical predispositions of
its own; by denying the reality of the distinction
between essence and existence in existing 
creatures; by making the principle of individuation to
be matter and form together; by not allowing the
philosophic possibility of creation from all eternity.
Albertus Magnus (1193-1280), a German, 'the
Universal Doctor,' the best travelled, the most
erudite, the most vigorous and long-lived of all
the Schoolmen, was first a soldier, then became
a Dominican, when he was over thirty years old:
he studied and taught at Cologne, Hildesheim,
Freiburg, Ratisbon, Strassburg, and finally at
Paris: he organised the studies of his Order, was
consecrated bishop of Ratisbon, then resigned his
bishopric and returned to his studies, which he
prosecuted with ardour at Cologne even to 
extreme old age. He was a voluminous writer.
Perhaps his greatest achievement in philosophy
was a paraphrase of Aristotle, with notes, some his
own, some borrowed from others.  'Our intention'
he says, 'is to make all the parts of Aristotle, physics,
metaphysics, and mathematics, intelligible to the
Latins.' Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon were
the two chief Schoolmen who applied themselves
to physical science and advocated experimental
methods. In the width of his studies, Albertus
of all the Schoolmen best represents Aristotle.
But he had not Aristotle's accuracy, precision,
and self-consisteucy, as those qualities shone forth
in his great pupil Aquinas.<P>

St. Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), 'the Angelic
Doctor,' chief of the Schoolmen, born in Southern
Italy, entered the Dominican Order in 1243, came
to the University of Paris in 1245, and there for
three years heard the lectures of Albertus Magnus, 
taking his Bachelor's Degree in 1248, in
which year he followed Albertus to Cologne. He
returned to Paris in 1253, took his Master's
Degree (along with St. Bonaventure) in 1257, and
thereupon lectured for two or three years, lectures
the substance of which probably we have in his
<i>Summa Contra Gentiles</i>.  He left for Italy in
1260, returned a third time to Paris in 1269,
finally returning to Italy in 1271, and dying on
his way to the Council of Lyons in 1274.  His
great work is the <i>Summa Theologiae</i>, but his
<i>Opera Omnia</i> fill many volumes. There will be
more to say of St. Thomas when we come to his
great opponent Averroes.<P>

John Duns Scotus (1266-1308), a native of the
British Isles, the 'Subtle Doctor,' was to the
Franciscans what Thomas Aquinas had been to
the Dominicans.  For centuries afterwards Schoolmen 
were divided into Thomists and Scotists.
Scotus was the glory of Oxford as St. Thomas of
Paris. We find him lecturing in Oxford for
ten years, 1294-1304; thence he went to Paris;
thence in four years to Cologne, where he was
welcomed like a prince, and died almost 
immediately upon his arrival.  He commented on
the Logic, Metaphysics, and <i>De anima</i> of Aristotle.
His commentary on the <i>Sentences</i> of Peter 
Lombard is called the <i>Opus Oxoniense</i>. His later
work at the University of Paris, where he became
Doctor of Theology, is the <i>Opus Parisiense</i>. In
Scotus, great Schoolman as he was, Scholasticism
overreached itself, and entered upon a subtlety
which was the beginning of its decline. Scholastic
philosophy works out like algebra: and as in
algebra one easily forgets the data of sensible
experience from which one started, and revels
in formulae alone, so, too, Scholasticism tends to
lose itself in formalism away from <i>a posteriori</i>
facts. There is such a thing as a delicious oblivion
of external realities, and a joy in the workings of
one's own mind; yet a dangerous joy, as is the
joy of the inebriate, who in his transport is robbed
of his property.  Truth, objective truth, is or
ought to be the possession of the philosopher.
Scholasticism is not the only philosophy that has
suffered by excess of formalism: the philosophies
that have grown upon the foundations laid by
Kant have suffered yet more.<P>

Scotus had a genius for mathematics: he 
delighted in distinctions and differences, and in
criticism of the standard philosophers of his day,
including 'Brother Thomas.' He bequeathed to
the discussion of posterity a distinction called
'formal and real' (<i>formalis a parte rei</i>), as that
between animality and rationality in man, or
between wisdom and goodness in God. He says:
'It is a distinction in every way antecedent to
our thought: wisdom is in the thing from the
nature of the thing; and goodness is in the thing
from the nature of the thing; but wisdom in the
thing is not formally (precisely) goodness in the
thing.' All the Schoolmen, it may be remarked,
took wonderful interest in the differences of things,
and in the hierarchy of being. Scotus makes
Will the chief faculty: St. Thomas is an 
Intellectualist. Scotus ascribes to the Will of God
not only the existence of creatures, but even their
very natures and essences. Other Schoolmen
have held the same. The doctrine would change
the whole face of philosophy. Some think that
it would conduct to the sheerest Nominalism and
be the ruin of all truth. Scotus places Beatitude
in an act of the Will. St. Thomas, with Aristotle,
places it in Vision, the act of the Understanding.
Beyond the primordial matter of St. Thomas
(<i>materia prima</i>, which he calls <i>secundo-prima</i>),
Scotus discovers a primo-primordial (<i>primo-prima</i>) 
matter, which he asserts to be the fundamental 
element in the constitution of all creatures,
even the angels, whom he will not allow to be
pure forms. This primo-primordial matter is
never found in isolation, but God, if He willed,
could isolate it. On the relation of reason to
revelation, Scotus and St. Thomas are agreed that
it is the office of reason to bow to revelation, to
prove by argument some truths of religion, and
to answer difficulties in the way of other truths,
which it cannot directly prove, but must accept
as revealed. Scotus, however, critical spirit that
he was, was less confident than St. Thomas as
to the range of religious truth that reason could
directly establish.  Thus he found the 
philosophical arguments for the immortality of the
soul unconvincing, as also those for the resurrection 
of the body: for a 'sure and certain hope of
resurrection' he considered that we must fall
back upon faith. Nay, he was not clear as to
the rational proof of the omnipotence of God.
He writes in his thesis (called <i>Quodlibetum</i>) for
his Doctorate at Paris (q. 7, n. 32): 'It is true
then that sovereign active power, or infinite
power, is omnipotence; but it is not known by
natural reason that the highest power possible
(<i>suprema potentia possibilis</i>), even though 
infinite in intensity, is omnipotence properly so
called, that is to say, power immediately 
available to act upon any and every possibility.'
This growing distrust of reason as an active
support of faith is to be noted. It is the first
autumn tint of decay. In its bloom Scholasticism
was more confident of its powers.<P>

Roger Bacon (1214-1294), an Englishman, 'the
Wonderful Doctor,' studied at Oxford; in 1245
was teaching at Paris; entered the Franciscan
Order, probably in the convent at Oxford, when
he was over forty years of age; got into trouble
with his Superiors, but was vindicated in 1266
by Clement IV, then newly seated in the papal
chair. To that Pope he dedicated his <i>Opus
majus</i>, his <i>Opus minus</i>, and his <i>Opus tertium</i>,
the two latter works being a sort of second and
third editions of the first, put in briefer form,
with some new matter. When the Pope, his
protector, died, Bacon was in trouble again. He
was summoned from Oxford to Rome to answer
for himself in 1278, and spent some time in
prison. He is said to have been buried at
Oxford, where 'Folly Bridge,' on which in the
eighteenth century stood what was then called
'Welcome's Folly,' and had been Friar Bacon's
Observatory, still dimly preserves his memory
<A HREF="schnt30.htm">*</a>.<P>

Bacon himself was a bridge, or point of 
connection, between Scholasticism and the Physical
Science of our day. Aristotle had said (<i>De generatione 
animalium</i>, iii. 10): 'We must believe the
evidence of our senses rather than arguments,
and believe arguments if they agree with the
phenomena'; and Bacon wrote: 'Without 
experience nothing is known.' St. Thomas would
have said the same, and the Schoolmen generally,
with their own qualifications and explanations.
Bacon quite speaks the mind of his scholastic
contemporaries in writing: 'There are two modes
of knowing -- by argument and by experience:
argument concludes and makes us grant the
conclusion, but does not produce certainty and
remove doubt, and enable the mind to rest in
sight of the truth, unless it find it by the way
of experience.' But it may be admitted that as
there are minds to-day who revel in pure 
mathematics and have small taste for physical research,
so the Schoolmen as a body preferred abstract
argument to <i>a posteriori</i> inquiry, although they
acknowledged the utility of the latter. And this
was a weakness of the School. The brilliant
exception, as we have seen, was Albertus Magnus,
along with Bacon.  Bacon, then, did make 
experiments and take observations, as he was able: he
was astronomer, alchemist (the chemist of those
days), optician, geographer, and geometer. He
seems to have made a telescope: he argued the
possibility of 'cars moving with incalculable
speed without draught-cattle,' also of 
suspension-bridges and flying-machines. Tradition ascribes
to him the invention of that dubious instrument
of civilisation, gunpowder.  He declared the
Milky Way to be a collection of many stars.
He had also a great zeal for history, a subject
on which his age was sadly ignorant, and for the
study of languages as an instrument of history.
This predilection for history was connected with
his philosophical views. It is dangerous and
misleading to register philosophers of earlier
centuries under names of schools that have
appeared in our time. With this caution we
may say that Bacon was something of an 
Ontologist and something of a Traditionalist. He was
an Ontologist (as was Rosmini) in this, that what
scholastics call 'the active intellect,' the maker of
universal ideas in the mind, he took to be no part
of the human mind, but God Himself.  In this,
Bacon went some way at least with the Persian
Avicenna (<i>Contra Gentiles</i>, ii. 74, 76: <i>Of God
and His Creatures</i>, pp. 142 sq.). However wrong
Bacon and Avicenna be in this opinion, they are
not for that Pantheists.<A HREF="schnt33.htm">*</a>    
As a Traditionalist
(approximating to but not coinciding with De
Bonald and De Lamennais), not as a votary of
physical science, Bacon wrote: 'Philosophy, taken
by itself, is no use.' It had to be eked out, he
considered, by revelation. That revelation was
given in the beginning, and must be sought in
the writings of the ancient sages. Hence his
insistence on language and history, as things
indispensable for our placing ourselves in the
current of tradition. 'It was impossible,' so
writes this great investigator of nature, 'it was
impossible for man to arrive of himself at the
great truths of sciences and arts, but he must
have had revelation . . . .  The fulness of 
philosophy was given to the same persons to whom
was also given the law of God, that is, to the holy
patriarchs and prophets from the beginning of
the world.' St. Thomas would hardly have gone
so far.<P>

Bacon was at Oxford while St. Thomas was at
Paris. Oxford, however, was unfriendly in his
life-time to the great Paris Doctor, and even 
condemned him after his death. As a scholastic,
Bacon is pre-Thomist and Augustinian. He
believes in <i>rationes seminales</i>, or predispositions
in primordial matter, as also in that plurality of
substantial forms which St. Thomas abhorred.
Like Scotus, Roger Bacon was critical of his
contemporaries, nay even abusive, a defect of
judgment which embroiled him with the heads of
his Order. Still there is no evidence to show
that Roger Bacon was aught else than a devout
Friar Minor and a staunch Catholic.<P>

<B>4. The Antagonists of Scholasticism, the Arabians.</b>

<i>Fas est ab hoste doceri</i>, 'it is right to make your
enemy your teacher.' The Arabians taught the
Schoolmen; and the Schoolmen first learnt from,
then battled with, the Arabians, using the weapons
which their masters had placed in their hands.
Not that there was any personal intercourse
between Mohammedan and Scholastic. The
teaching was received through books; it was
done by translations. At Toledo, in the twelfth
century, there was a regular school of translators
from Arabic into Latin, or often from a Hebrew
translation of the Arabic. The wares sold well,
Toledo translations as well as Toledo steel; and
the labour of translating went on briskly in the
century succeeding. The translations referred
to were of Aristotle, and of commentators on
Aristotle, sometimes Jewish, sometimes Greek.
The Arabs got their Aristotle originally from the
Syrian Greeks. More than any other Greek
writer, Aristotle captivated the Arabian mind
In his person once more did captive Greece take
captive her rude conqueror, as Mohammedanism
gradually engulfed the provinces of the Byzantine
Empire. The Castor and Pollux of the Arabian
philosophy, in the appreciation of their Western
compeers, were Avicenna and Averroes. Both
were strong Aristotelians. The latter, for his
success in commentating on Aristotle, is usually
referred to in scholastic writings as 'The 
Commentator.' Aristotle in his Arabian dress so
alarmed the orthodoxy of the Catholic Church as
to be proscribed in the University of Paris. It
was the glorious function of St. Thomas to remove
the stigma from the Stagirite, to set aside the
Arabian interpretations, and to put Christian 
constructions upon the sayings of him to whom he
ever lovingly refers as 'The Philosopher.' Truth
and orthodoxy are one thing, Aristotelianism is
another.  Whether Albertus Magnus and St.
Thomas, or Avicenna and Averroes, more 
faithfully represented the real mind of Aristotle, is a
large question not to be gone into here. 
Probably Aristotle was neither quite so orthodox on
the one hand, nor quite so erratic on the other.
The Arabians, it must be confessed, wove into his
text pieces of Neo-Platonist and Oriental mysticism
and astrology, to which his sober mind was a
stranger.<P>

Avicenna (Abu Ali Ibn Sina),<A HREF="schnt36.htm">*</a> a native of
Persia, 980-1037, interests us on two accounts:
for his view of the 'active intellect' and for his
view of Providence. The former topic has been
brought out already, in speaking of Bacon. On
Providence Avicenna held, and interpreted
Aristotle, <i>Metaphysics</i> xii., to teach, that God
knows nothing but Himself and the ideal order
of things possible, that He is ignorant of all other
actualities and individual existences besides His
own, and particularly that things evil, trivial, and
mean, are wholly beyond His ken and His care.
This doctrine is confuted by St. Thomas, <i>Contra
Gentiles</i>, i. 63-71, 50-54.  Ultimately, however,
Avicenna did admit in God a knowledge of 
particular things, not got by virtue of His own
nature, but by knowledge communicated to Him
from the angels, spirits emanating from God,
who presided over the heavenly spheres, and
thence observing earthly things, made report
thereof to the Most High.<P>

Averroes (Abu Walid Mohammed Ibn Roschd),
1120-1198, born at Cordova, died in Morocco, had
many followers in the University of Paris, with
whom St. Thomas was in continual warfare, chief
of them being Siger of Brabant. Averroism was
rife in Europe for four centuries; and he who
shall study it well, will scarcely think it extinct
at this day. It fascinates without satisfying. 
The great Commentator was wrong, egregiously
wrong, in his conclusions; yet he had before him
a truth which he never reached, which none has
reached since, though many have endeavoured;
a discovery the making of which would renovate
philosophy. I refer to the conjunction of the
human mind with the divine, called by the Arabs
<i>ittis&acirc;l</i>. Averroes, then, held that every human
mind was in contact with an Intelligence greater
than itself. This commanding Intelligence not
only formed universal concepts for all mankind,
and so was identified with the Aristotelian 'active
intellect' (here Avicenna went with Averroes),
but also stored and kept the concepts when made,
being also one with the Aristotelian 'potential intellect' 
(here Averroes stood alone).<A HREF="schnt38a.htm">*</a>  Thus
man could neither form intellectual concepts for
himself, nor keep them in himself when formed.
His act of understanding, in fact, was done for
him, and put into him from without.  Man by
himself was but the highest of sentient natures;
a sentient nature, however, in contact with
intelligence. The manner of this contact (<i>ittis&acirc;l</i>;
in Latin <i>continuatio</i>) was thus: By his senses
man gets impressions which are stored in him
as sensory images, or phantasms; with the
phantasm in the human mind the corresponding
idea in the external<A HREF="schnt38b.htm">*</a>  
Intelligence conjoins itself.
Having thus a phantasm of his own, conjoined
with an idea belonging to another, man thereby
has an intelligent view of what the phantasm
represents, and thus man understands.<P>

But, urges St. Thomas (<i>Contra Gentiles</i>, ii. 59),
'the fact that an intelligible impression united
with a foreign understanding comes somehow
to be in man, will not render man intelligent;
it will merely make him understood by that
separately subsisting intelligence.' Any one 
interested in the conflict of Aquinas with Averroes
should study the long chapters <i>Contra Gentiles</i>,
ii. 73,75; <i>Of God and His Creatures</i>, pp. 135-141,
144-148.<P>

This doctrine, called the doctrine of the 'Unity
of the intellect,' and consequently of the will, in
all mankind, created immense excitement in the
Western Schools, and called down the 
condemnation of the Church. It removed individual
responsibility, individual rational souls, and 
consequently individual immortality. No Averroist
was ever able to state what their one Active and
Potential Intelligence, which did the office of
understanding for all mankind, in itself was.
Averroes declined to say that it was God,
so escaping the charge of pantheism. Somehow
it seemed to be dependent for its being on the
continuance of the human race, which Averroes
declared to have existed from all eternity and
to go on for ever. It was the eternal common
stock of many individual minds. It was a sort
of Impersonal Tradition. But it was nothing
definitely.<P>

Apart from this strange doctrine, which he
opposed with all his might, St. Thomas took
many things from Averroes, as did Albertus
Magnus from Avicenna.<P>
