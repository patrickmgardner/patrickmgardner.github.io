<h2>THE SPIRIT IN WHICH THE SCHOOLMEN WORKED.</h2><p>

IN full freedom of spirit, then, did the Schoolmen labour. They 
commented Aristotle; they put forth philosophical speculations; they 
developed theological science; they observed and studied the laws of 
Nature, making serious though ineffectual efforts to rend the veil and 
wrench her secrets from her keeping, without suffering the least 
embarrassment from the Faith that was their life. We have seen the 
Church set down as a primary rule of action, that the theologian should 
not attempt to rationalize the mysteries of religion,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> and that, in 
the stead, he should cultivate the Early Fathers and the Sacred 
Scriptures; also that the philosophers should not trespass upon the 
preserves of theology. "There is not," says an impartial witness who 
has made a thorough study of the Schoolmen, and who has learned to 
appreciate them, "there is not a logician of the thir<!--
86 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p86"></a>teenth century, who, on assuming his seat, does not begin with the 
declaration that, this chair not being one of theology, he will place 
beyond all controversy the mysteries and sacraments in order solely to 
discuss those questions not interdicted by authority. It is not recent 
doctors, then, who drew the line of distinction between the two 
domains; the Middle Ages recognized it, professed it, and more or less 
scrupulously acted upon it."<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Let us for a moment look into the works 
of a few of the great Schoolmen and note the spirit that guided their 
pen. <p>

There is Albert the Great (1193-1280). The vastness of his labours is 
appalling. The wide range of subjects which his genius took in by way 
of summaries, commentaries, and tracts -- philosophy, theology, 
mathematics, natural history in its chief branches, physics, astronomy, 
mechanical engineering; sermons and lectures upon spiritual subjects; 
the very list of them would fill a volume<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> -- and upon which he gave 
out thoughts original and striking, has well merited for him the title 
of Universal Doctor. How did this untiring genius enter upon his 
studies? Here are his words: "A philosopher should admit nothing 
without sufficient reason, for it 
 <!--
The Spirit in which the Schoolmen worked. 87  
 --><A NAME="p87"></a>
 is a desire innate to all of us to know the causes of things natural, 
to study their properties and to seize their differences."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Have they 
not the ring of an extract from some modern scientist? Again, in the 
same spirit he advises his brethren to study Nature, not for the sake 
of explaining her prodigies, but for the better understanding of her 
ordinary laws: "We are not to seek in Nature how God, according to His 
good pleasure, employs creatures to work the prodigies by which He 
makes His power so striking, but rather such phenomena as are of 
ordinary occurrence and act according to natural causes."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> Here is 
the spirit of modern scientific investigation. This man, so just in his 
remarks, so correct in his method of approaching philosophical 
subjects, has been accused of the basest subserviency to Aristotle. 
Undoubtedly the Master has great weight with him; but he knows how to 
discriminate between the truth and error in his writings. "Whoever 
believes Aristotle to be God," he tells us, "may also believe him never 
to be in the wrong; but admitting him to be a man, then unquestionably 
may he err like the rest of us."<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> And elsewhere he states the 
principle 
 <!--<p>

88 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 -->
 of this philosophical independence: "It may behove the Pythagoreans to 
swear by the word of the Master; for our part, we are content to 
receive the word when its truth shall have been proven by reason."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup>
Because he sought to make Aristotle his own in this independent spirit, 
did he merit to have it said of him: "Never was the doctrine of 
Aristotle treated with greater scope and even depth."<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> We are not 
surprised that the timid chronicler should represent Albert as a man 
drunk with the wine of profane wisdom.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> But, it may be asked, how far 
in actual practice did Albert verify all these fine words of his? We 
will take him in natural science, and we will bring a competent witness 
to testify. But we must not forget that the age was one of many 
scientific superstitions, when astrology was identified with astronomy, 
and alchemy with chemistry,<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> and fantastic explanations took the place 
of experimental investigation, then  
 <!--
The Spirit in which the Schoolmen worked. 89  
 --><A NAME="p89"></a>
 unthought of. From it all Albert was not free. None the less do gleams 
of light run across his pages. They excite the warm admiration of 
Humboldt He is surprised at the delicacy of observation betrayed in 
Albert's reasonings upon the structure and physiology of plants;<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> 
upon the simultaneous dependence of climate on latitude and elevation, 
and the effect of different angles of the sun's rays in heating the 
earth; upon the influence of mountains in determining the warmth or 
coldness of a locality.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> They seem to him far and away beyond the 
epoch in which lived "this man of vast erudition."<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

But the chief fruit and glory of the life and labours of Albert, was 
Thomas Aquinas (1227-1274). It is the great merit of the Angelical 
Doctor that he knew how to tend with admirable tact the doctrines of 
the Church and the teachings of human reason. He holds that philosophy 
is good and useful and in a measure necessary for the discussion of 
those natural truths that are the preambles of Faith, amongst which he 
includes the existence of God;<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> no less good and necessary is it as 
a means of refuting difficulties raised against the 
 <!--
90 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p90"></a>
 dogmas of religion. The higher truths and mysteries transcending the 
reach of human reason, in the spirit of a true philosopher, he accepts 
upon authority.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> He is unwearied in laying stress upon the fundamental 
principle that between the truths of reason and the truths of 
revelation, when rightly understood, there is neither divergence nor 
discord.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> "Since grace," he tells us, in his masterpiece, "does not 
destroy nature, but rather betters it, therefore should natural reason 
minister unto faith just as the natural bent of the will should aid 
charity."<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup><p>

And in another place he puts the question directly as to whether 
theological questions should be answered upon the principle of 
authority or upon that of reason; and his reply is, that, if repelling 
the doubts of an adversary, the adversary should be met upon his own 
grounds and his own arguments made use of. "Such arguments," he adds, 
"should be employed as show the why and wherefore of the thing, 
otherwise we would know that a thing is so, but would acquire no 
knowledge concerning it."<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> And how aptly St. Thomas could bring to 
bear the scientific spirit upon scientific work, is well illustrated in 
his comment upon the various explanations made by Aristotle and others 
to account for the diverse movements of the 
 <!--
The Spirit in which the Schoomen worked. 91  
 --><A NAME="p91"></a>
 planets. He is not satisfied with any of them. These suppositions need 
not be taken as the true solution; they only seem to explain the facts; 
by some other way not yet known of men may their motion be 
explained.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> Could Charles Darwin, who was a model of scientific 
modesty, be more guarded? <p>

Finally, note the spirit in which Roger Bacon (1214-1294) laboured. 
Born out of his due time centuries too early, he finds himself out of 
place in his age. He loathes Scholasticism as heartily as Descartes. He 
abuses nearly all of his contemporaries. He abuses Albert; he abuses 
Thomas; he abuses Bonaventura; he abuses Michael Scott; he loads abuse 
upon Alexander of Hales. He has no sympathy for "those tractates and 
summae -- horse-loads composed by many -- and not at all with the most 
holy text of God."<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> He has the soul of a humanist in his love for 
philology. He looks upon a thorough study of the languages as the basis 
of all true scholarship and sound criticism. He has the soul of the  
 <!--<p>

92 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 -->
 Baron of Verulam in his eager desire to promote the study of the 
physical sciences by means of the inductive method. His pages palpitate 
with disgust for what was best in his age, and with an insatiable 
yearning to achieve the scientific conquests of later days. That one 
thought takes hold of him and absorbs his attention and energy; like 
all men possessed of an engrossing idea, he can see good nowhere 
outside of the thought of his heart. He is a child of his own age only 
in the simplicity and earnestness of his faith and in his burning zeal 
for religion and morality. He too, as well as Albert and Thomas, knows 
how to distinguish between authority and reason, and is no less 
scientific in his method of inquiry. "In every science," he tells 
us, "the best method must be employed. . . This method consists in 
placing first in order that which should be first known, the more easy 
before the more difficult, the general before the particular, the 
lesser before the greater; one should always study the things that are 
most useful, for life is short. And science should be so treated as to 
bring conviction without doubt and clearness without obscurity. But 
this is impossible without experiment. For we have three modes of 
knowing; namely, authority, reason, and experiment. Still, authority 
does not bring with it knowledge unless it is weighed, nor does it of 
itself give intelligence, but only credulity; for we believe on 
authority, but we do not receive from authority our understanding of 
the subject. Nor 
 <!--
The Spirit in which the Schoolmen worked. 93 
 --><A NAME="p93"></a>
 can reason distinguish between sophism and demonstration, unless we 
know the conclusion from experience and practice, as I shall prove 
further on in the experimental sciences. But very few have made use of 
this method in study, as shall appear below; and therefore secret and 
most important wisdom has remained hitherto unknown to the majority of 
learned men."<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> Remember that this passage was penned in the 
thirteenth century, when men were supposed to do no thinking and merely 
to swear by Aristotle. Whilst Bacon appreciated Aristotle, and made a 
careful study of him, he held in slight esteem the translations of 
translations, or rather the parodies of his writings then so much in 
vogue. And it is while declaiming against these that he bursts out into 
an oft-quoted but ill-understood expression: "For my part," he says, 
"if it were given me to dispose of the books of Aristotle, I would have 
them all burned; for the study of them only causes loss of time, 
engenders error, and propagates ignorance beyond anything 
imaginable."<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> Thus do we find the three greatest and most 
representative intellects of the age not only thinking in the spirit of 
real philosophers, but in their writings we actually happen upon the 
roots of that immense tree of experimental science which so overshadows 
our own day. "It is," says Pouchet, "two men of the thirteenth 
 <!--
94 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p94"></a>
 century, Albert the Great and Roger Bacon, who conceive it in all its 
power and fecundity, and to them must we restore the glory of having 
first indicated it."<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> And if documents speak truly, Aquinas himself 
was no less practical than the great Franciscan or his own great 
teacher; for among other books, which, upon the death of Thomas, the 
University of Paris begs from the Dominican Order, and which he had 
promised to send them when completed, besides an exposition of the 
Timaeus of Plato there was a treatise upon the construction of 
aquaducts and machinery for raising and conducting water.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> But in 
good truth these great Schoolmen had a mission far other than that of 
commenting or imitating Aristotle. If they used the Stagyrite, they 
also used Plato; and if they used both, it was in accordance with the 
principle of true philosophy, which Aristotle himself sums up in these 
words: "We shall at first do well to look into the 
 <!--
The Spirit in which the Schoolmen worked. 95 
 --><A NAME="p95"></a>
 speculations of others before us, so that if they speak not truly 
we may not share in the blame attached to them; and if there should be 
any doctrine common to them and ourselves, we will not stand alone 
under criticism. It is always pleasant to speak of things in a manner 
better, or at least not any worse, than others."<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> Children of their 
age, they accommodated themselves to the cravings and aspirations of 
their age. They therefore gave themselves to the studies that best 
satisfied those cravings and aspirations. Even for Roger Bacon --
vehement though he be in denouncing the theological writings of his day 
-- theological studies have a special fascination. The Arab and the Jew 
brought Aristotle to the door of the Schoolmen, placed him in their 
hands, and attempted in his name, with weapons forged in his workshop, 
to overthrow the doctrines and dogmas of the Church. The Schoolmen also 
forged weapons in the same workshop, and with them made a scientific 
defence of the Church, and struggled against the inroads of Arab and 
Jew for centuries, and routed them as completely from the intellectual 
field as did Castillian phalanx from the Spanish soil. And when the 
genius of painting represents St. Thomas in a halo of light emanating 
from the Godhead and reflected from the writings of Moses, the 
Evangelists and St Paul on the one hand, and on the other from those of 
Plato and Aristotle, Averroes beneath 
 <!--
96 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p96"></a>
 him in agony of confusion, his great Commentary overturned and 
transfixed to earth by a ray from the saint's writings, it but 
concentrates and epitomizes the contest between the intellectual forces 
of Christendom and rationalistic Mohammedanism.<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> But neither St. 
Thomas nor his co-labourers, trained as were their intellects, keen as 
was their philosophical insight, were mere adepts in speculation. They 
were earnest men, and theirs was an earnest work. It was a work of 
explanation and reconciliation of the truths of religion with those of 
reason; it was a defence both of reason and religion against the 
rationalism of the day. Theirs is the philosophy of theology. It is the 
philosophy on which the Church has built her definitions; it is the 
language in which she explains her dogmas and her doctrines. One who 
was not of the Church, but who was possessed of the truest and best 
instincts of the historian, has put the whole question in a nutshell: 
"It is absurd," says the late Professor Brewer, "to condemn the 
Schoolmen for their great devotion to Aristotle,<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> as if they had 
created his authority and not found it established; <i>equally absurd 
is it to condemn them for dialectical subtleties, when dialectical 
subtleties were overmatching Christianity.  
 <!--
The Spirit in which the Schoolmen worked. 97 
 --><A NAME="p97"></a>
 They were the men to show how Christianity was the answer to men's 
doubts; how Aristotle was to be reconciled with Revelation, not 
Revelation with Aristotle</i>."<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

Thus was theirs a work not only of defence, but of reconstruction as 
well. The Early Fathers, in their writings, and especially in the 
decrees of the Councils of the Church, contributed to the clear 
definition and explanation of many of the dogmas of Christianity. But 
the Greek Schism on the one hand, and the incursions of the barbarian 
on the other, checked the progress of their work. The Schoolmen took up 
the scattered shreds and wove them into a complete science of religion. 
If they used Aristotle, they were only walking in the footsteps and 
following the counsel of the great teachers who had gone before them. 
"If" says St. Augustine, "we find that those who are called 
philosophers should happen to say some things that are true and that 
can be adapted to our faith, we are justified in using them."<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> The 
Schoolmen took indeed the literal form of Aristotle, but they gave it a 
new sense. They breathed into the dry bones that passed down to them 
among the wrecks of other civilizations, and forthwith the dry bones 
became a thing of life. Another spirit 
 <!--
98 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p98"></a>
 animates them. The philosophy of the Schoolmen is as different from 
the philosophy of Aristotle, as the nature of the sturdy oak is from 
that of the soil in which it is rooted. A cursory comparison of both 
will reveal to us the intrinsic difference. <p>
