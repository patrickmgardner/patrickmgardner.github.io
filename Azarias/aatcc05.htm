<h2>ARISTOTLE IN THE EAST.</h2><p>

ANOTHER stream of Aristotelian thought is about commingling with this 
and adding to the intensity of discussion. It begins at the same 
Alexandrian source. To trace it thence, through all its windings till 
it merges with the Bo&euml;thian stream, is interesting and instructive. 
The early Greek Fathers, as a rule, deal more universally with Plato 
than with Aristotle. The numerous heresies that spring up in the 
fertile brain of the Greeks and the Syrians, find in the Aristotelian 
philosophy a basis on which to support their peculiar views; and the 
more they attach themselves to Aristotle, the more the Catholics become 
shy of him. Irenaeus (140-202), who is profoundly philosophical and 
versed in all systems, but who makes all subservient to religious 
truth, accuses Valentinus and his followers of corrupting the candour 
and simplicity of the Christian Faith by subtleties drawn from 
Aristotle.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> In another place, the same Father 
 <!--
Aristotle in the East. 27 
 --><A NAME="p27"></a>
 accuses a certain sect of adoring Aristotle as well as the Saviour.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> 
Gregory Nazianzen, speaking of various means by which heresy wounds the 
Church, mentions, among others, the low artifices of the Aristotelian 
art.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> Still, when Julian had forbidden Christian masters to teach the 
Pagan classics, Gregory prepared a series of text-books, among which is 
an abridgment of the <i>Organon</i>.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> The Dialectics of John of 
Damascus, which forms the first part of his work called <i>Source of 
Science</i>, epitomizes the Categories and Metaphysics of Aristotle and 
the Introduction of Porphyry. It rendered good service in its day,<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> 
and it is still popular.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> The bishops of a Council of Pontus 
accentuated the attitude of the orthodox of their day, when in a letter 
to the Emperor they said: "We speak according to the Fisherman, and not 
according to Aristotle."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Eusebius cites reproaches made against 
Artemon and Paul of Samosata for holding Aristotle in too great esteem 
and seeking less the simple language of the Sacred Scriptures than the 
art of clothing their impiety with syllogisms.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> The Nestorians 
cultivated Aristotle with a special fervour. 
 <!--<p>

28 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 -->
 Diodorus of Tarsus, who in his anxiety to escape the errors of 
Appollinarius, had laid the seed of Nestorianism, wrote a work on the 
errors that he found in the Physics of the Stagyrite.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup><p>

But the School of Edessa became a great centre of Aristotelian 
doctrine, whence it was carried far and wide throughout the East. The 
story of the fate and the varying fortunes of this School is very 
instructive. The one first to give it a world-wide reputation was a 
genius great as a poet, great as an orator, great above all as an 
educator. His name, for centuries after he had passed from the scene of 
his labours, possessed a magic spell for the Syrian mind.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> Bardesanes 
(b. 154) was a staunch champion of the Church under persecution; but in 
the latter part of his life he fell away and became known as the last 
of the Gnostics. His teaching and influence overshadowed the School 
till about the middle of the third century, when we find its Christian 
character once more asserted. From its benches went forth St. Lucian, 
whose Greek version of the Scriptures became as authoritative in Asia 
Minor as the Latin version of St. Jerome in the West. He founded the 
celebrated School of Antioch, and modelled it after that of Edessa. 
Then Edessa enjoyed another brilliant era of about eighty years under 
the 
 <!--
Aristotle in the East. 29 
 --><A NAME="p29"></a>
 influence of St. Ephraim (d. 378) and his disciples. The writings of 
Ephraim are regarded as Syriac classics of the purest style. His 
fervent religious poems merited for him the title of Lyre of the Holy 
Ghost. The story of his life reads like romance. His early poverty, 
adventures, and mishaps; his education by his saintly bishop; his 
exquisite knowledge of his mother-tongue; his teaching. it in the 
school of Nisibus; his flying to Edessa and working in the public baths 
to make a living; his becoming a monk; the fame of his conferences and 
commentaries going out; his being called to the chair of Sacred 
Scriptures in the School of Edessa; his being made deacon in his old 
age and the wonderful sermons he preached: it is all a life-story that 
has hallowed Edessa in the heart of every lover of literature.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> But 
other influences were soon to change the face of the School of Edessa. 
Under Ibas, the Nestorian bishop of the place, Cumas and Probus 
translated from Greek into Syriac the Nestorian writings of Theodore of 
Mopsuesta and the works of Aristotle.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup>
 <!--
30 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p30"></a>
 Indeed, the School became such a hotbed of heresy that it was 
scattered, in 489, by the Emperor Zeno; the extensive buildings were 
demolished, and a Church was built upon the site.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Narses, after having taught Sacred Scriptures for twenty years in 
Edessa with signal success, removes, in 490, to Nisibus.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> He there 
establishes a School to which flock many of his old pupils. A Syriac 
record speaks of the event in no complimentary terms. "The leprous 
Narses," says Simeon Beth-Arsam, "established a school in Nisibus."<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> 
He is an enthusiastic admirer of Aristotle. He has brought the works of 
the Stagyrite with him. He teaches and expounds them, and his spirit 
enters into his disciples. His pupil, Abraham of Casca (<i>flor.</i> 
502), comments upon the Dialectics.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> The school of Nisibus enjoys a 
far-reaching reputation for science and letters. We may form some 
conception of its extent,  
 <!--
Aristotle in the East. 31 
 --><A NAME="p31"></a>
 when we remember that less than eighty years after its foundation, it 
was divided into three distinct schools under three eminent masters, 
and that one of them -- Hannan -- had eight hundred students.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> Its 
fame extended even to Italy. Cassiodorus hears of it; and in his zeal 
for the revival of learning amongst the Romans, he writes to Pope 
Agapetus a letter bemoaning the deplorable state of education in Rome, 
even to the absence of a single good Christian school in the city, and 
begging of him to bring from Nisibus some of its learned teachers. 
These were troublous days in the West; the struggle for existence in 
the midst of war and invasion, from the Franks on one side and 
Belisarius on the other, absorbed all men's energies; in consequence 
naught came of the proposal of Cassiodorus. From the School of Nisibus, 
the works of Aristotle, after other professors had translated them and 
commented upon them, passed to the School of Bagdad.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> There Honain (d. 
876), and his son Isaac, and his very clever nephew, Hobaish, made them 
known to the Arabians.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> The  
 <!--<p>

 philosophic mind of Arabia was not slow to appreciate them; it found 
them most congenial to its thinking. It devoured and assimilated them 
with an avidity that became infectious.  <p>

<a name="n_11"><a href="#n11">{11}</a></a> Assemanni gives this short fragment from the Syriac of Benattib:  
"James of Nisibus established St. Ephraim, teacher of the Syriac 
language; but after the invasion of the Persians, Ephraim fled to 
Edessa, where he spent the remainder of his days, and directed a school 
which continued after his death" (Assemanni, <i>Bibl. Orient.</i>, tom. 
iii. p. ii., <i>Dissertatio de Syris Nestorianis</i>, p. 924). Alban 
Butler, in his <i>Lives of the Saints</i>, gives a very indefinite and 
very colourless account of St. Ephraim. <p>

<a name="n_12"><a href="#n12">{12}</a></a> In this work of translating Aristotle into Syriac Catholics as well 
as Nestorians took part. Assemanni mentions the fact in these words : 
"Hinc patet, apud Syros tum Orthodoxos, tum Nestorianos Philosophiam 
Aristotelicam prius coli coeptam fuisse, quam apud Monophysitas. 
Versionem Dialecticae Aristotelis Jacobus Edessenus fecit. Nicolai 
autem librum de Summa Aristotelicae Philosophiae &egrave; Graeco in 
Syriacum transtulit Honainus Isaaci filius (<i>Bibl. Orient.</i>, tom. 
iii. p. 85). <p>

<a name="n_13"><a href="#n13">{13}</a></a> Assemanni, ibid., tom. iii. part ii. p. 926 ; also tom. iii. part 
i, p. 2.  <p>

<a name="n_14"><a href="#n14">{14}</a></a> Assemanni, <i>Bibl. Orient.</i>, tom. iii. p. ii. p. 927. <p>

<a name="n_15"><a href="#n15">{15}</a></a> Ibid., p. 927. We may add that the cognomen of Narses was Garbana 
or Seprosus. See Assemanni, tom. iii. p. 63. <p>

<a name="n_16"><a href="#n16">{16}</a></a> Ibid., p. 154. <p>

<a name="n_17"><a href="#n17">{17}</a></a> Assemanni, ibid., p. 927. <p>

<a name="n_18"><a href="#n18">{18}</a></a> Brother Athanasius translated the <i>Isagoge</i> of Porphyry into 
Syriac in 645; Bishop James, of Edessa (d. 768), made a version of the 
<i>Categories</i> (Munk, <i>Melanges de Philosophie Juive et Arabe</i>, 
p. 353). <p>

<a name="n_19"><a href="#n19">{19}</a></a> Honain translated from Greek into Syriac: (1) <i>A Book of 
Philosopic Aphorisms</i>; (2) Commentaries on the <i>Categories</i> and 
the <i>Per&icirc;hermenias</i> of Aristotle. He corrected the Arabic 
version of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>, translated by Theodore. He, 
with his pupils, Isaac, Hobaish, and Surinus, put into Arabic or Syriac 
the <i>Posterior Analytics</i>, the <i>Metaphysics</i>, the book on 
Physics, that on Generation and Corruption, and that on the Soul 
(Assemanni, <i>loc. cit.</i>, pp. 165-169).<p>
