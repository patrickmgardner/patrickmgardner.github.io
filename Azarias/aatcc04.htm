<h1>IV.</h1>
<h2>ARISTOTLE IN THE WEST.</h2><p>

THE Aristotelian philosophy meanders down the ages in two distinct 
streams, both welling forth from the Alexandrian School like life-blood 
from the human heart, to meet and mingle centuries afterwards, in the 
leavening of intellectual life. We have seen that the Western current 
set in with Bo&euml;thius. He gave students, with his own comments, the 
treatises of Aristotle on the Categories and, in his own word, that on 
Interpretation.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Therein they learned to distinguish between substance 
and accident, to consider a subject in regard to its environments of 
time and place, its quality and quantity, its manner and habit of 
existence, and the like; they learned to establish the relations of 
subject and predicate, of affirmation and negation, of the possible and 
the impossible, of the contingent and the necessary; they learned how 
to examine words, phrases, and sentences.  
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p19"></a>
 All this was wholesome. It was giving the still untrained intellect of 
mediaeval youth a means, and an example of the highest authority, 
whereby to fix precision of terms, to classify, to define and divide, 
and to construct propositions with accuracy. But in addition to all 
this, Bo&euml;thius gave a short treatise of Porphyry (232-304) written 
as an introduction to the Categories. It bas been considered a valuable 
improvement upon the doctrine of Aristotle. But, in the opening chapter 
of that little treatise, Porphyry poses a problem which he does not 
there attempt to solve; which is amongst the most important in the 
history of philosophy; which is also amongst the most difficult to 
solve, and upon the solution of which schools and even peoples have 
quarrelled. It is the threefold problem concerning the nature of genus 
and species. <i>Do genus and species subsist, or are they solely mental 
fabrications? If subsisting, are they corporeal or incorporeal? 
Finally, do they exist apart from sensible objects, or are they in 
those objects, forming with them something co-existent?</i><sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Such are 
the questions which Porphyry put and refrained, from answering,<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> but 
which Bo&euml;thius threw into the Western brain. Porphyry refrained 
from their solution then and there, because of their difficulty and 
because they required  
 <!--
20 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p20"></a>
 great research;<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> and yet Porphyry held the traditions of the Lyceum 
and the Academy, and was furnished in the Alexandrian libraries with 
all the means of research. But without the philosophical traditions of 
Athens, and without the means of determining the historical position of 
the problem; with simply a few definitions and with the instrument of 
the syllogism, the Schoolmen attacked it with all the rashness and 
energy that come of great ignorance and great strength. It was an 
epoch-making problem, but it was prematurely thrown upon the 
intellectual world of the West. Minds were not sufficiently trained for 
its profitable discussion. None the less did they grapple with it and 
fight over it; and in the sparks of light that escaped from that 
question did they discuss all other questions. "Since the world began 
to solve the question of Porphyry," says John of Salisbury, "the world 
has well grown old; more time has been consumed than it has taken the 
Caesars to conquer and rule the world; more money has been expended on 
it than ever was in the treasure of Croesus."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

But, can we say that we are still free from the problem? Are we not 
constructing all our philosophy upon the one problem underlying that of 
Porphyry? Have we gotten beyond the problem of knowing? Are  
 <!--<p>

 -->
 we not divided into as many rival camps, upon the very same issues 
under cover of other names as were the Schoolmen? Attempt a solution; 
at once you lay yourself open to attack and contradiction, and other 
solutions equally plausible are posited, only in turn to be replaced by 
others again neither more nor less plausible than your own. Had 
Bo&euml;thius allowed that Introduction of Porphyry to lie buried in 
the East, what might be the history of thought to day? Would men have 
devoted more time to observation, to language, to letters? Would 
national literatures have become more developed? Or did the robust 
discipline, the strain and struggle of intellect clashing with 
intellect, and wrestling with a problem that even such giants as Plato 
and Aristotle could no more place beyond dispute than have Kant or 
Rosmini been able to do in our own day -- did it help to lay deeper 
the foundations of thought and prepare for later developments? Answer 
we these questionings how we will, the fact remains that thus the 
problem took possession of the intellect of Europe and for centuries 
threw it into a turmoil of controversy not unfrequently carried on with 
passion and recrimination. <p>

It is needless to enter upon the absorbing work that during those ages 
occupied the Church in her mission of civilizing the barbarians who 
invaded and overturned the old Roman culture. Small room was there   
for philosophy in this work. Small place had it in the 
 <!--
22 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p22"></a>
 intelligence of the child of Nature, just emerging from his woodland 
home, with his simple habits and his few wants. To teach him the 
elementary truths of the Christian religion, to subdue the native 
fierceness of his nature, to accustom him to peaceful pursuits, and 
above all, to induce him to live up to the Christian standard of 
morality -- this was the primary work of the Church. To this must all 
else yield. If ever pope understood the spirit of the Church, it was 
Gregory the Great (550-604). He was a student devoted to his books. 
But possessing in an eminent degree the Roman genius for administration 
and organization, he makes all else subservient to this end at a time 
when administration and organization are most needed. Now, Gregory 
learns that a bishop gives his time and attention to the teaching of 
letters, doubtless at the sacrifice of his more imperative duty of 
administering his diocese and furthering the kingdom of God amongst his 
people; and forthwith Gregory rebukes him severely for undertaking to 
teach youths pagan myths when in all probability their souls were 
famishing for the bread of Christian truth.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> This rebuke has been 
misunderstood because the times and the circumstances have been 
ignored. <p>

But according to times and opportunities we may trace the slow 
expansion of the mediaeval intellect. The work so auspiciously begun by 
Bo&euml;thius is continued 
 <!--

 -->
 by Cassiodorus (468-562), who in his old age compiles manuals for 
youths. Isidore of Seville (d. 636) keeps  up the tradition of 
learning. The Venerable Beda (673-735) also prepares a compendium of 
philosophy for his boys. Alcuin (736-804) teaches the Dialectics from 
some of the treatises of Bo&euml;thius and from a compendium of the 
Categories, which he erroneously attributed to St. Augustine. The doses 
of Aristotle so far administered to the youth of Western Europe were of 
a mild character. The only part of his writings known in the ninth 
century was that on Interpretation as translated by Bo&euml;thius.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> 
Towards the end of the tenth century, the same author's version of the 
Categories began to be introduced.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> The education given was more 
grammatical than philosophical. The Dialectics taught, dwelt almost 
exclusively among words. Still, by means of these handbooks is the 
Aristotelian tradition kept alive. <p>

With the eleventh century a new spirit of study breathes over the face 
of Western Europe. Larger scope of speculation is exercised. The focus 
of this new spirit is to be found in the Monastery of Bec, where the 
sacred fires are kept up by Lanfranc and Anselm. But in proportion as 
intellectual activity becomes rife, does the spirit of rationalism grow 
bold. It dictates the unorthodox assertions of a Roscellin. It inspires 
the restless activity of 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p24"></a> 
 an Ab&eacute;lard (1079-1142). Men become possessed of a mania for 
knowledge, and like Ab&eacute;lard fly hither and thither to every 
master of reputation, only to find their thirst increasing and their 
craving more unsatisfied. Ab&eacute;lard is attracted to Laon by the 
fame of the monk Anselm. He has left on record his impression: "I 
approached this tree to gather fruit, but I found it sterile like the 
fig-tree cursed by the Saviour."<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> Adelard of Bath (<i>flor</i>.
 1100-1130) drifts first to Tours, then also to Laon; but satisfied, 
neither with himself nor his teachers, he leaves his pupils and, 
braving untold perils, travels amongst the Greeks, the Syrians, and the 
Arabs, bringing back with him doctrines more Platonic than 
Aristotelian.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> But during the twelfth century the stream of 
Peripatetic philosophy swells to larger dimensions. Other books of 
Aristotle find their way into the West, and are translated, and throw 
more light upon the Catagories and Predicaments, and give further 
ground for argument.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> Peter the Lombard (d. 1164) applies 
Aristotelian principles to theological questions,<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> and constructs the 
celebrated 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p25"></a>
 Book of Sentences, which long after continued to be the manual of all 
theological students. He was only repeating -- and perhaps reproducing 
-- what John of Damascus had done four hundred years previously.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>
