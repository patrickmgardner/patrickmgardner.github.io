<h1>XII.</h1>
<h2>ARISTOTLE AND THE CHURCH IN MORALS.</h2><p>

IN the department of Ethics Aristotle brings to bear the same happy 
method and the same keen intellectual vision that run through all his 
writings. He who knew how to define so well God and the human soul is 
only a little less happy in his analysis of the human heart; and he is 
so because, as we have seen, he failed to catch the intimate union 
between the Creator and His creatures. Still he is admirable in his 
treatment of virtue and vice, and of the disciplining of human 
character into the practice of the one and the avoidance of the other. 
"And," says an authority already quoted, "no greater praise can be 
given to a work of heathen morality than to say, as may with truth be 
said of the Ethical writings of Aristotle, that they contain nothing 
which a Christian may dispense with, no precept of life which is not an 
element of the Christian character;<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> and that they only
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church in Morals. 113 
 --><A NAME="p113"></a>
 fail in elevating the heart and the mind to objects which it needed 
Divine Wisdom to reveal, and a Divine Example to realize to the 
life."<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> That Aristotle did fall short of the Christian ideal is to be 
looked for. His premises could not carry him further. Holding as he 
did, that the soul dies with the body, he could see no other supreme 
aim in life, no other standard of happiness, than the highest and most 
perfect activity of the soul during the span of its years. And so, the 
outcome of his reasoning he thus expresses: "But if happiness be the 
exercise of virtue, it is reasonable to suppose that it is the exercise 
of the highest virtue; and that will be the virtue or excellence of the 
best part of us. Now, that part or faculty -- call it reason, or what 
you will -- which seems naturally to rule and take the lead, and to 
apprehend things noble and Divine -- whether it be itself Divine or 
only the Divinest part of us -- is the faculty the exercise of which, 
in its proper excellence, will be perfect happiness. . . <i>Our 
conclusion, then, is that happiness is a kind of speculation or 
contemplation. . . . The man who exercises his reason and cultivates 
it, and holds it in the best condition, seems also to be the most 
beloved of heaven.</i>"<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> Herein is embodied the weak point of his 
system; therefrom flow others no less weak. <p>

Again, argues the Stagyrite, since the object of virtue
 <!--
114 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p114"></a>
 is the attainment of the highest happiness and the chief good of this 
life, whatever includes these things is highest and chiefest. But, as 
the whole is by necessity prior to the part, the State is by nature 
clearly prior to the family and to the individual.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> In the State, 
then, must reside the chief good for man. It is better and more 
complete both to attain and secure.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> That man is good who fulfils the 
end and aim of the State. But the State exists, not for the sake of 
life only, but for the sake of a perfect and self-sufficing life.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> 
The good citizen is therefore the superior of the good man. The State 
should mould him to its end.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> "This," he tells us, "can only be 
effected if men live subject to some kind of reason and proper regimen 
backed by force."<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> At the last analysis, the sole sanction for the 
practice of virtue is that which comes from the State. The great object 
of living virtuously is that the State may profit thereof. The very 
virtues upon which the philosopher lays stress, are those most 
contributing to the well-being of the State. This is the meaning of 
individual perfection. It is not a sense of virtue that rules the 
community -- however isolated cases may have been so influenced -- so 
much as a sense of self-sufficiency. And this grows out of the 
relations of society to the State. 
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church in Morals. 115 
 --><A NAME="p115"></a>
 Men lived for the State. The virtue of patriotism was the primary, 
all-absorbing virtue of society. For this men were disposed to be 
frugal and industrious, prudent and just and temperate, and willing to 
make many sacrifices, even the sacrifice of life itself. Hence it is 
that Aristotle makes justice the primary virtue. "Justice," says he, 
"is the bond of men in States, and the administration of justice, which 
is the determination of what is just, is the principle of order in 
political society."<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> "That which is for the common interest of all is 
said to be just."<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> The exclusive practice of such virtues tended to 
make men sturdy, proud, and self-sufficient. "For," says Aristotle, 
"what each thing is when fully developed, we call its nature, whether 
we are speaking of a man, a horse, or a family. Moreover, the final 
cause and end of a thing is the best, and to be self-sufficing is the 
end and the best."<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> And this sense of self-sufficiency is the 
characteristic trait that runs through the story of the great heroes of 
antiquity. It taught revenge, but it could not teach meekness; it 
inculcated pride, but it could not inculcate charity.  <p>

Not but that with time, and thought, and the advance of civilization, 
with its increase of humanizing influences, the moral sense grew more 
delicate and the finer virtues came to be appreciated. Stoicism 
restored the link of 
 <!--
116 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p116"></a>
 union and intimacy with the Divinity, which Aristotle had missed, and 
in consequence established a high and unbending code of morality; but 
the code of Stoicism, as well indeed as all other Pagan codes of 
morality, was confined to a favoured few who had the leisure for 
meditation and aspirations and sentiments above their fellow-men. There 
is not a moral law of our nature that human reason is not competent to 
evolve. There is not a moral precept inculcated in the Gospel that had 
not been practised among the disciples of Pythagoras or Gautama, by Jew 
or Brahmin. This is the great merit of the New Law that it only 
elevated and sanctified and brought home to the lowliest the best and 
noblest aspirations of the choice souls of humanity. The evolution of 
the moral sense from the days of Aristotle to those of Cicero is 
marked. Already do we begin to hear words of sympathy for the slave, 
and the feeling of a universal brotherhood is dawning.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> There are 
certain privileged spots near the statues of the gods in which the 
slave fleeing the wrath of a harsh master may find sanctuary.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> To the 
moral views of Seneca and Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius the evolution 
is still more wonderful. Seneca is profoundly impressed with the sense 
of human sinfulness. He enters into himself, and makes that daily 
examination of his conscience which has so edified Roger Bacon.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> "We
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church in Morals. 117 
 --><A NAME="p117"></a>
 have all sinned," he tells us; "some more gravely, others more 
lightly; some from purpose, others by chance impulse, or else carried 
away by wickedness external to them; others of us have wanted fortitude 
to stand by our resolutions, and have lost our innocence unwillingly 
and not without a struggle."<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> But withal Seneca wavered as regards 
belief in a future existence. He regarded the sage as superior to God 
in all else but immortality. His philosophy was the philosophy of a 
strong nerve. Epictetus, the crippled slave who sought to make of his 
whole life a hymn of praise to God, is one of the noblest and most 
beautiful characters of antiquity.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> He had great delicacy of 
conscience. He guarded his thoughts as carefully as his deeds. He also 
felt oppressed by the sense of sin. He asks: "Is it possible for a man 
to be sinless? It cannot be; but it is possible to strive unceasingly 
after sinlessness."<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> But Epictetus looked to no life beyond the 
present. Marcus Aurelius has left on record thoughts beautiful as they 
are consoling on nearly every aspect of morality. He was translated as 
a book for spiritual reading, by Cardinal Barberini, who dedicated it 
to his own soul in order to make it
 -->

 -->
 redder than the purple he wore at the sight of this Gentile's 
virtues.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> But Marcus Aurelius never rose to a true conception of the 
sacredness and dignity of human life. He could not overcome Stoic 
indifference to suicide.  <p>

These men represent what was best in Pagan morality. But we of to-day, 
in the light of Christian truth and in the presence of the Sermon on 
the Mount, feel the shortcomings of their greatest and best codes. 
Stoic calm is not Christian resignation. The suppression of the 
affections is not their sanctification. And thus is there a profound 
abyss between what is highest and best in Pagan morals and the simplest 
practices of Christian teachings. Moreover, the sublime maxims of those 
choice spirits were within the reach of the cultured and leisurely few, 
and had little or no influence upon the many. Not that among the people 
of the Roman world a more humane disposition was not becoming felt. 
"When," says Aub&eacute;, "Alexander Severus reduced the rights of 
fathers over children to simple corrections; when Hadrian decreed that 
in future should a master be killed by his slaves the penalty of death 
would extend only to those surrounding his person and who might have 
foreseen and prevented the danger; when, going still further, he 
completely deprived masters of the right of life and death over their 
slaves -- these emperors only incorporated into the laws
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church in Morals. 119 
 --><A NAME="p119"></a>
 what was already a thing of custom."<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> All this while Christian 
truths and Christian maxims were dawning upon the world, and were 
proclaimed from forum and amphitheatre, and conviction of their truth 
was sealed with the blood of martyrs; and though Pagan philosophy may 
not have recognized the source, it could not have ignored the light 
that was increasing from dusk to noonday brilliancy.  <p>

We would here call attention to what we consider a confusion of 
language in a clever writer of the day. He says: "There are certain 
ages in which the sense of virtue has been the mainspring of religion; 
there are other ages in which this position is occupied by the sense of 
sin. Now, of all systems the world has ever seen, the philosophers of 
ancient Greece and Rome appealed most strongly to the sense of virtue, 
and Christianity to the sense of sin."<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> In this passage are the 
recognition and the misapprehension of an important truth. There  
 <!--
120 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p120"></a>
 never was a religion without a sense of sin. This is the meaning of an 
altar and a sacrifice. But in the philosophies, and in the public life 
of ancient Greece and Rome, this sense of sin became buried out of 
sight among the passions and aspirations of the hour, and so naught is 
heard of it. The pages of Plutarch, it is true, reveal virtuous act and 
virtuous word, but rather as the result of a certain active energy, 
imparting a healthy tone to the whole man, than as deliberate deeds 
performed with the deliberate purpose of attaining the ends of virtue. 
This is not the sense of virtue. The Apollo of Belvidere is the Grecian 
ideal of manly grace and beauty. But what is the predominant 
expression? Is it not that of a proud, self-sufficient, self-reliant, 
well-developed, sensuous manhood, trained to the full top of its 
capacity? In no trait may we read the sense of virtue. We have found 
the later Stoic moralists fully realizing the sense of sin. But they 
were exceptions. To the Church is it due to have revived that almost 
forgotten sense, and sanctified it and made it productive of 
repentance, by bringing it into intimate relation with the sorrows and 
sufferings of the Divine Redeemer. Now, repentance means not only a 
rising out of sin, but also a striving after the opposite virtue.  <p>

And here is where the Divine mission of the Church becomes so apparent. 
She brings home to man his origin and his destiny. She instils into him 
that what<!--
Aristotle and the Church in Morals. 121 
 --><A NAME="p121"></a>ever there is of good in his nature, is given him for the purpose 
of attaining that end. Virtue is the habitual action -- or rather the 
sum of habitual actions -- tending to the end for which man was 
created. That end, she does not hold with Aristotle to be
 self-development, or self-sufficiency, or the good of the State. That 
end is none other than God. His Will defines the rectitude of action in 
which the soul should dwell. Anything that turns man away from his 
final destiny -- anything that absorbs his attention and his energies 
to the total exclusion of that destiny -- becomes sinful.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> Sin, then, 
is the state of a soul voluntarily and freely and with open eyes, 
knowing what it does, diverging from its final end, which is God, 
putting in the stead the lesser goods of life, and making unto itself a 
law of its own.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> The Church brings home to her children the great 
unreasonableness, injustice, and enormity of this  mode of acting and 
living, by impressing upon them the truths that thereto is to be 
ascribed the whole degradation of humanity; that therefor did Jesus 
Christ suffer and die, in order to raise man up from the low state in 
which he lay prone and helpless. Therefore is it that the sense of sin 
is deep in the Christian heart; but there is none the less the sense of 
virtue, or rather the consciousness of striving after perfection by the 
way of virtue.
 <!--
122 Aristotle and the Christian Church.  
 --><A NAME="p122"></a><p>

The Pagan ideal was that of harmonious development of soul and body. 
The Christian ideal looks farther. It goes beyond the natural order. It 
tells us to be perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> Besides 
the natural virtues, it recognizes others which are of the supernatural 
order. There are the theological virtues of Faith in God and the truths 
of His Revealed Religion; of Hope for union with Him in eternity; of 
Charity, wherewith we love Him with all our heart and all our soul, and 
in Him and for Him, our neighbour as ourselves. It made predominant a 
criterion of excellence other than the approval of men. We catch 
glimpses of such a criterion in the advanced Stoics. Marcus Aurelius 
touched upon it when he said: "Never forget that it is possible to be 
at once a Divine man, yet a man unknown to all the world."<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> It is the 
criterion that seeks approval of God rather than of men, and cultivates 
the hidden virtues rather than those that shine. Christ gave the 
example of them in His life, and taught them in His preaching. Modesty 
of demeanour and humility in thought and act arising from a sense of 
one's unworthiness before God; chastity in thought as well as in speech 
and deed; obedience to all lawfully constituted authority, seeing its 
source and sanction in God; poverty in spirit; resignation to the 
Divine Will under all trials and troubles, accepting as from the Hand 
of God, whatever 
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church in Morals. 123 
 --><A NAME="p123"></a>
 of sickness, or pain, or bodily infirmity, or annoyance from without 
that may befall one; the meekness that resents not injuries, that 
considers itself blessed amid revilings and persecutions, that returns 
good for evil; the spirit of prayer: these are a few out of the many 
virtues that Christianity in an especial degree made its own. These 
constitute the Christian ideal. It is the ideal that an Aquinas 
followed when, resisting the importunities of flesh and blood, he 
abandoned the comforts of a lordly home, that he might, in the 
retirement of the cloister, practice those virtues and live in intimate 
union with God. It is the ideal that the tens of thousands of delicate 
virgins, thronging the convents the world over, have in view, in 
entering with a light heart and a cheerful spirit upon their lives of 
prayer and self-devotion; it is the ideal that moulds the Sister of 
Charity ministering to want and disease and crime and misery. It is the 
ideal of Jesus and His Virgin-Mother. Here is a whole world of action 
and motive entirely unknown to Aristotle. <p>

It need no longer surprise that St. Thomas surpasses himself in that 
portion of his masterpiece treating of morals. We stand at the sublime 
source whence he drew his best inspirations. Aristotle found in the 
State his chief reason for the practice of virtue. Indeed, he expressly 
tells us that "women and children must be educated with an eye to the 
State, if the virtues of either of them are supposed to make any 
difference -- in the virtues 
 <!--
124 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p124"></a>
 of the State."<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> St. Thomas regards things in the light in which the 
Church places them for his apprehension. That light goes beyond the 
convenience of State; it looks further than the gratification of human 
selfishness; and in doing so, it has benefited both the State and the 
individual. Dwell a moment upon the line of reasoning which the Church 
has held from the beginning. God is Creator. He is more; He is 
Preserver. Without His conservative act all things would fall back to 
their original nothingness. As air retains the light of the sun, 
without being itself the sun, so every creature of God participates in 
the being of God without sharing His Divine essence.<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> Therefore man 
is indebted to God not only for existence, but also for the prolonging 
of that existence. God created all things for Himself. He imposed upon 
them the law according to which they may reach their final destiny. To 
man has he given a rational soul by which to know the laws of his 
nature and to follow the path in which is traced his destiny. Hence 
that submission to God's law which man, in common with all other 
creatures, is clearly bound to pay. Hence man's responsibility toward 
God; hence that sense of duty; hence that voice of conscience. Again, 
man is endowed with a free will. God claims from him a willing homage 
or none at all. There is open to him the way of virtue or the way of 
vice. He has inbred in his nature passions which are 
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church in Morals. 125 
 --><A NAME="p125"></a>
 not in themselves bad, and which, when controlled, may become the 
means of his sanctification and perfection. Love is the source whence 
they all arise.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> Love is also the principle by which they are held in 
hand. It is the law of union binding man with man and man with God. "He 
that abideth in charity, abideth in God, and God in him."<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> It is the 
inspiration of zeal for all good.<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> It is the principle of activity in 
every intellectual being. It underlies all man's actions.<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup> It is the 
fulfilment of the law.<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> It is of God's own essence, for God is Love. <p>

Hitherto other principles -- now of might, now of right, now of 
justice, now of expediency -- ruled men. The Gospel introduces the law 
of love, and before its brilliancy all other systems pale; gradually it 
takes possession of the public conscience, and the predominant 
principles of other days drop out to be imbedded in the records of 
history. It revolutionizes life and thought. It brings home to men, as 
no philosophy could ever bring home to them, the Divine lesson of an 
universal brotherhood based upon the mystery of redemption. It causes 
men to realize the sacredness of human personality. It breaks down the 
barriers of rank and class. It teaches the 
 <!--
126 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p126"></a>
 doctrine of true liberty, true equality, and true fraternity. It looks 
upon the soul of a slave as something as precious in the sight of God 
as that of a free-born citizen. It inculcates the dignity of labour. 
The Pagan world understood the value of labour, but the Pagan world 
never raised itself up to a proper conception of the dignity of labour. 
Labour had become so identified with slavery that it was considered 
degrading. The artisan was unfit to be a citizen. He was too busy to 
practise virtue. "No man," says Aristotle, "living the life of a 
mechanic or labourer, can practise virtue."<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> All this was changed by 
Jesus, the Son of the carpenter.<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup> He blessed the poor. He raised up and 
dignified labour. He showed men how to sanctify it. And so, that which 
had been regarded as a curse and a hardship, has come to be the 
greatest blessing to man, to soothe his pains, to heal the wounds of a 
troubled heart, to develop energy, and to help him to save his soul. 
Pagan legislation taught men how to endure privations and sufferings 
for their country's sake; it taught them to see naught of good beyond 
the narrow limits of their own territory; it inspired them with no 
sympathy for weakness, no consolation for sorrow, no reverence for old 
age, no tenderness for decrepitude, no sense of the awful sanctity of 
human life. It exposed the helpless weakling as unfit to live;<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup> it 
sanctioned
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church in Morals. 127 
 --><A NAME="p127"></a>
 and at times commanded the destruction of the babe yet unborn;<sup><small><a name="n35"><a href="#n_35">{35}</a></a></small></sup> it 
placed in the hands of the head of the household, the power of life and 
death over slave, wife, and child.<sup><small><a name="n36"><a href="#n_36">{36}</a></a></small></sup> All this, with more equally 
criminal and equally unjust, had been of ancient law and ancient 
custom. It has passed out of the public conscience. A new law, the Law 
of Divine Love and Divine Grace, shines upon the world and renews the 
face of the earth,  <p>

Elsewhere the author even goes farther and speaks of Pagans as holding 
for their ideal the beauty of holiness! "The eye of the pagan 
philosopher was ever fixed upon virtue, the eye of the Christian 
teacher upon sin. The first sought to amend men by extolling the beauty 
of holiness, the second by awaking the sentiment of remorse" 
(<i>European Morals</i>, vol. ii. p. 4). Surely, outside of a few stray 
expressions in Persius and other Stoics, there is nothing in Pagan 
literature to justify such a statement. <p>
