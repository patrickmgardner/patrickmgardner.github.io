PREFACE.<p>

THE present Essay is prepared, by request of the
Concord School of Philosophy, as a contribution to its
Summer Session of 1887. The Essay proposes to
establish two points:<p>

1. Documents not long discovered and only recently
availed of, have enabled the Author to place, for the
first time, he believes, before the English reader, the
true record of the attitude of the Church towards
the Aristotelian Philosophy, from its condemnation by
the Council of Paris in 1209 to its full recognition by the
Legates of Pope Urban V. in 1366. This has been
hitherto a vexed question, but ill-understood and
 ill-explained. <p>

2. The Author has also endeavoured to show the
spirit in which the Schoolmen worked, and to prove
that the Philosophy evolved by them is as distinct
from that of the Lyceum as Saint Peter's is from the
Parthenon. Aristotle's influence is there; his terms and
his formulas are employed, but the inner spirit and the
guiding principle are far different.
 <!--
vi Preface.
 --><p>

In developing these two points, the Author has made
no effort to exhaust his subject. He is content to throw
out suggestions and indicate lines of thought which the
reader may pursue into further details. The subject is
no less vast than it is important. The literature which
has grown out of it is rich, varied, and extensive.
Cardinal Manning, in a letter addressed to the Author
upon reading the proof-sheets, shows cause why this
importance attaches to the subject. With the permission
of His Eminence, the Author publishes that letter,
which will have all the more weight when it is remembered 
that His Eminence in early manhood was moulded
in the Aristotelian discipline which St. Edmund had
introduced into Oxford, and that later on, His Eminence
learned to appreciate the depth and grasp and power of
St. Thomas.<p align="center">

ARCHBISHOP'S HOUSE, WESTMINSTER, S. W.,<br>
Aug. 6, 1887.<p>

DEAR BROTHER AZARIAS: -- I returned from our Annual Retreat only last
night, and send back with my thanks your proofs on Aristotle and the
Christian Church.<p>

It shows very industrious and extensive research, and is full of interest to
Catholic students. The supremacy of Aristotle in the intellectual world of
nature, and that of St. Thomas in the illumination of faith, are the two great
lights of natural and supernatural truth. From the time of St. Edmund, who
brought the study of Aristotle from Paris to Oxford, the tradition of study
at Oxford rested on Aristotle and Faith. Now it has wandered to the world
of Rationalism, which Aristotle and St. Thomas purified.<p>

Your book will be very useful in recalling students to the world-wide
philosophy of the Catholic Church. I wish you all blessings in your
studies. <p align="center">

Believe me. always<br>
Yours faithfully in J. C.,<br>
HENRY E., <i>Cardinal-Archbishop</i>.
