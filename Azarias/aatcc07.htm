<h1>VII.</h1>
<h2>ARISTOTLE AND THE CHURCH.</h2><p>

FROM the Arabian schools the Peripatetic infection spread to Christian 
schools and Christian cloisters. Raymond, Archbishop of Toledo and High 
Chancellor of Castile, established an academy for the translation of 
the Arabian commentators. "Each day," says Haur&eacute;au, "increased the 
number of books received by the School of Paris from the Academy of 
Toledo; each day revealed some new science."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Translations, both of 
Aristotle and his commentators, were made from the Arabic into a jargon 
almost unintelligible and frequently misleading. The translator, in his 
haste to supply the eager demand; stopped not to enlighten himself upon 
the meaning of special words and even whole phrases, but transcribed 
the Arabic terms instead of their Latin equivalents.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup>
 <!--
50 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p50"></a>
 The doctrine that Averro&euml; s gave out as coming from Aristotle, 
bore to the real doctrine of the Stagyrite as much resemblance as the 
Alhambra bore to the Parthenon. Nor need this surprise. Hard indeed 
would it be to preserve unchanged doctrine first passing out of the 
original Greek through the phrasings of a Syrian mind; thence 
transferred to the phrasings of an Arabian mind; thence again put into 
the phrasings of a Western mind in such Latin terms as it might 
command. Harder still would it be for an Arabian commentator, with his 
peculiar bias of mind, to grasp all the delicate shades of meaning, 
difference, and distinction, in which the acute Greek intellect was so 
much at home, especially after those shades had been travestied in so 
many renderings.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> In spite of these difficulties, students and 
masters blindly accepted and drank in with equal avidity the true and 
the false. They became intoxicated with the new doctrines. They grew 
bold, troublesome, and violently disputatious. "Their tongues," in the 
expressive words of John of Salisbury, "have become torches of war."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup>
It is the spirit of rationalism that, from various sources, without 
collusion, each independently of the other, is inundating the 
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church 51
 --><A NAME="p51"></a>
 University of Paris. There are strange words heard from the teacher's 
chair. There are mysterious whisperings carried on behind many a barred 
door and in many a secret corner, of wonderful social and religious 
changes about to take place; of the inadequacy and inefficiency of the 
old order; of the inauguration of a new order and a new gospel. It is 
written and repeated in the  name of a saintly monk that "towards the 
year 1200 of the Incarnation of Our Lord, the spirit of life having  
gone out of the two Testaments, the Eternal Gospel was born."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> Amaury 
of Bennes (d. 1207) broaches a most un-Christian doctrine. He teaches a 
threefold incarnation: that of the Father in Abraham; that of the Son 
in Jesus Christ; that of the Holy Ghost in the chosen spirits of the 
day. He gathers around him disciples who possess a body of secret 
doctrines and practices. Believing themselves the incarnation of the 
Holy Ghost, they fancy themselves above sin and regard every passion as 
lawful.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> Sometimes the spirit of unbelief breaks loose and is heard 
aloud; as when Simon of Tournay, after a powerful discourse that had 
made a strong impression, 
 <!--<p>

52 Aristotle and the Christian Church.
 -->
 exclaimed in the pride of his heart, that greatly as he had exalted 
and confirmed the law of Christ, he could be still more effective in 
destroying it, if he so minded.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> David of Dinant finds in the
 pseudo-Aristotle and his Arabian commentators a scientific basis upon 
which to ground doctrines that embody this rationalistic spirit. "All 
things are one, for whatever is, is God:" so speaks, in the rashness of 
youth, his disciple Bernard the Sub-Deacon.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Another says: "Hitherto 
the Son operated; but henceforth to the end of the world it is the Holy 
Ghost who shall operate."<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> These were among the fundamental doctrines 
of the new sect. The bishops of France became alarmed at the ravages it 
was making among their flocks. Not only had it taken possession of the 
novelty-seeking student; it was found that learned clerics and 
venerable priests were ardent propagators of the new doctrine. 
Practical and wealthy men of business, like the goldsmith William 
D'Aire, were among the most active workers in its behalf. In 
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church. 53
 --><A NAME="p53"></a>
 1209 the Provincial Council of Paris condemned the teachings of Amaury 
and David, and with them the Aristotelian books on which their 
doctrines were supposed to be based; it forbade in the University all 
further reading of the Natural Philosophy and commentaries thereon, in 
private as well as in public.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup><p>

This decree is of primary importance. Paris was then, and continued to 
be for centuries afterwards, the great intellectual centre of Europe. 
The University shared with the Empire and the Papacy the controlling 
influence over the civilization of the West. "The University of Paris," 
says Mr. Bass Mullinger, "throughout the thirteenth century, well-nigh 
monopolized the interest of the learned in Europe. Thither thought and 
speculation appeared irresistibly attracted; it was there that the new 
orders fought the decisive battle for place and power; that new forms 
of scepticism rose in rapid succession, and heresies of varying moment 
riveted the watchful eye of Rome; that anarchy most often triumphed, 
and flagrant vices most prevailed; and it was from this seething centre 
that those influences went forth which predominated in the contemporary 
history of  
 <!--
54 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p54"></a>
 Oxford and Cambridge."<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> The decree emphasizes the beginning of a 
long struggle for existence, upon which Aristotle is now entering, at 
the threshold of the most active and the most momentous period in the 
whole history of mediaeval thought. In considering the attitude of the 
Church towards the Stagyrite in the varying phases of his fortune 
during the following two centuries, we find ourselves constructing one 
of the most delicate and critical chapters in the annals of the human 
intellect. It is a subject that has been ill-understood. Enemies of 
the Church have misrepresented her action in the matter; her friends 
have indulged in lame excuses and abject apologies for which she has 
neither recognition nor thanks. A simple statement of facts from 
documents which it is our privilege to use, will show that both 
aspersion and apology are uncalled for. <p>

The Aristotelian books condemned by the Provincial Council of 1209, may 
have been, and in all probability were, distorted editions and epitomes 
of the Stagyrite, rendered and compiled from Arabian sources. We can 
safely say that none others could have been in general use so early 
in the century.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> Moreover, the same  
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church. 55
 --><A NAME="p55"></a>
 spurious works that we have seen influence the Arabian philosophy, 
were at this period in circulation among the Schoolmen, and in the name 
of Aristotle introduced Neo-Platonic principles.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> These also 
contributed to throw the philosopher in bad odour. However, the decree 
seems soon to have practically fallen into disuse. This may easily be 
accounted for. <p>

The beginning of the thirteenth century was a critical period in the 
history of the University of Paris. The relations between the 
ecclesiastical authorities on the one hand, and on the other, between 
the masters and students, were straining more and more to their utmost 
tension. Out of the frequent quarrels of those days grew the organic 
constitutional existence of the University as a body. Pope Innocent 
III. (d. 1216) had made his studies in Paris. He realized all the wants 
of the University; he took the deepest interest in its affairs; by 
gradually strengthening the hands of masters and
 <!--
56 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p56"></a>
 students, whilst weakening those of the Chancellor, he inaugurated the 
work of organization that was completed under Gregory IX. Indeed, the 
University had grown far and away beyond the controlling power of any 
one man, however competent.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> In such a state of affairs it was 
difficult to enforce any decree. Then again, in the rivalry of schools 
and masters is to be found another reason why the decree was at most 
only partially obeyed. Aristotle may not be taught in public under the 
shadow of Notre Dame; but who can account for the Rue de Fouarre and 
its dependent schools? Confusion prevailed; the conscientious were 
scandalized; the less scrupulous defied authority and read Aristotle 
sometimes openly, more frequently in secret. Innocent III., in 1215, 
enjoins upon Robert of Cour&ccedil;on, Papal Legate to Paris, to use 
his utmost endeavour to give better direction to studies in the 
University, and to remove those occasions of scandal and of error, 
which are no less pernicious to religion than to science. Robert takes 
into his counsel many good and learned men. Again do they find that 
Aristotle is not only read, but that he is made the source whence flow 
the errors then rife. Again do they condemn his Physics; also his 
Metaphysics, and all compendiums of them. But the statute of Robert 
permits the 
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church. 57 
 --><A NAME="p57"></a>
 Dialectics, both ancient and new, the Ethics, and four books of the 
Topics.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The statute removes the forbidden books from the lecture-hall; but the 
forbidden books are neither neglected nor forgotten. They are again 
quietly resumed. The intellectual craving of the day for Aristotle --
especially for the prohibited books -- will be satisfied with no other 
food. Doctrinal innovations begin to multiply. Masters quarrel with 
masters, and in their war of words descend to the greatest puerilities. 
Philip de Gr&egrave;ve, a stern and able chancellor of the University 
at this time, exclaims:<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> "We have made children of ourselves. . . . We 
have made of ourselves a laughing-stock to laymen. . . . Master is 
pitted against master, each gnawing away at the other."<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> And in a 
sermon preached about 1225, he thus alludes to the influx of 
rationalism that threatens to overwhelm all study "The torrents have  
 <!--<p>

58 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 -->
 destroyed nearly all our city; pouring themselves out upon the great 
sea of doctrine, they have disturbed its waves, hitherto so pure and 
calm. But as it is wisdom to retreat before the army of death in order 
to save life, so should we act in these times; it is our only plan to 
take shelter from the torrent and await its passing over. Though 
violent and rapid, its waters are only transitory."<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> The Chancellor 
is bearing witness, in his official capacity, to the power and 
influence of the innovators. With increasing numbers they grow bolder. 
No longer confining themselves to the theses which they were engaged to 
teach or defend, they attack the doctrines, the dogmas. the sacraments, 
and the mysteries of the Church. There is no subject too sacred for 
them. The highest and most mysterious truths of religion they attempt 
to bring within the grasp of their limited understanding. This state of 
affairs is brought to the notice of the Holy See. <p>

The Chair of Peter was at this time occupied by a man venerable in 
years -- he was then over eighty -- but with the wisdom and ripe 
experience of old age he combined a vigour and an activity rarely to be 
surpassed in youth. He was the patron of learning and the friend of 
learned men. He was alive to all the wants of the age. He knew the 
worth of Aristotle; but he must keep intact the Faith. He must compel 
speculation to remain upon her own domain. Accordingly, in 1228 Gregory 
IX.
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church. 59 
 --><A NAME="p59"></a>
 addresses a brief to the Faculty of Theology, rebuking the audacity of 
those professors who dare to introduce into matters of Faith the 
opinions of philosophers, especially of naturalists, and who, 
abandoning the safe doctrines of the Fathers of the Church, endeavour 
to explain revealed truths by the false and worldly science of those 
authors. He deplores the evils that have already resulted, and 
forebodes worse, from this bold manner of treating sacred sciences. He 
exhorts them no longer to obscure the purity of theology with those 
opinions, no longer to infect and corrupt the word of God.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> No name 
is mentioned in this brief. None was needed. Aristotle was the 
naturalist who was intruding upon the domain of Faith -- Aristotle  
and his commentators. So was it taken in Paris; but was it so 
understood in Rome? We think not. We think that Gregory knew the 
character of the corrupted or suppositious texts then, in use. Might it 
not be that he had learned to distinguish between these and the real 
Aristotle from his brilliant friend Michael Scott? At this very time 
Michael was translating Aristotle. It is only the previous year that 
Gregory, in a letter to Stephen Langton, mentions him in the highest 
terms as a beloved son who from boyhood up had been ardently devoted to 
letters and science, who was already well versed in the Arabic, Latin, 
and Hebrew languages, and who still sought to  
 <!--
60 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p60"></a>
 continue to build upon the foundations laid.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> In all probability 
Michael Scott was at that very time in Rome. <p>

Seldom was the University in such commotion as at this period. The 
masters and the ecclesiastical authorities -- the Bishop, the Chapter 
and the Chancellor -- quarrel over rights and privileges. The schools 
suffer.  
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church. 61 
 --><A NAME="p61"></a>
 The mediation of the Pope is invoked by the masters against the 
Chancellor and the Bishop. At the same time Aristotle continues to 
press for recognition. Neither masters nor students are satisfied. If 
the religious teaching orders are to hold their own in the schools, 
they must be able to reply at least to the objections drawn from the 
condemned books and prepare their pupils to refute them. If. they 
cannot teach Aristotle as they now possess him, why not prepare an 
expurgated text? This is the next suggestion that we find hinted at. It 
comes to us through Pope Gregory IX. In a Bull hearing date of April 
13, 1231, after pronouncing upon the recent issues between the 
authorities and the masters and students, he once more forbids the 
condemned books to be read; but he adds the limiting clause that the 
prohibition shall last only till the books shall have been examined and 
purged of every suspicion of error.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> Nor does he delay long before 
appointing a commission to examine and correct them. He has no 
difficulty in finding competent men. <p>

There is William of Auxerre, the Archdeacon of Beauvais. His 
commentaries on the Book of Sentences, show him to be a profound 
theologian, an acute philosopher, and saturated with Aristotle. He has 
left an indelible impress upon Catholic theology. In his work is first  
 <!--
62 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p62"></a>
 found fully stated the Aristotelian doctrine of Matter and Form as 
applied to the sacraments of the Church.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> The Pontiff learned to 
appreciate his wisdom and intellectual capacity when, in 1229, William 
accompanied his bishop to Rome. And, therefore, His Holiness some time 
previously invited him with others to discuss the educational reforms 
so urgently called for in the University of Paris.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> William at this 
time held a chair in the University. Whilst in Rome, calumnies had been 
spread abroad concerning him, in consequence of which the Chancellor 
and ecclesiastical authorities were disposed to deprive him of his 
chair; so His Holiness wrote to the King, beseeching him to restore 
William and another<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> to their positions; this he backed up with a 
missive in almost similar words commending them to the Queen, and 
begging her to use her influence in their behalf.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> No stronger proof 
than this can we have of the esteem in which Gregory held William  
 <!--
Aristotle and the Church. 63 
 --><A NAME="p63"></a>
 of Auxerre. Accordingly, William heads the names of the commission. <p>

Next comes Simon of Authie. He is Canon of Amiens, with a chair also in 
the University.<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> A notice of him, recently discovered, speaks of him 
as a very learned man.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> The Pontiff on account of his impartial 
spirit, appoints him with others to inquire into the disturbance 
between Town and Gown, in the quarter of St. Marcellas, in which 
several students were killed.<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> Again, we find him commissioned to 
procure the restoration of some professors to their chairs.<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> Next to 
the name of Simon is that of Stephen of Provins. He also in an especial 
degree holds the confidence and esteem of the Holy Father. He is not 
only learned, but evidently a man of prudence and tact; for we find the 
Pope, some years later, assigning to him the delicate mission of 
settling a long-standing and widely known dispute between a bishop and 
a monastery.<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup> He is also to be remembered as a friend and patron of 
Michael 
 <!--
64 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p64"></a>
 Scott, and sufficiently an admirer of Aristotle to enable Michael to 
dedicate to him one of his translations.<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Such are the men into whose hands Gregory places the prohibited books 
for examination. He empowers them, in a brief, bearing date of April 
20, 1231, to examine the books with all due attention and rigour, and 
scrupulously to retrench every error calculated to scandalize or in the 
least offend the readers of them, in order that the said books, without 
delay and without danger, may be restored to their places in the course 
of study.<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> Three days later, Gregory still further shows his good will 
towards the students of Aristotle: he writes to the Abb&eacute; of St. 
Victor's and the Prior of the Dominicans, empowering them to absolve 
both masters and students from all censures that they might have 
incurred in  
 <!--<p>

Aristotle and the Church. 65 
 -->
 reading the prohibited books.<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup> Nor is this all. In  May 5, of the 
same year, His Holiness commissions Simon of Authie and the Dean of 
Soissons to make every effort to restore peace in the University, and 
order L	in the studies so long disturbed.<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup> A new spirit is breathed 
into the University. Du Boulay writes: "In the year 1231, the Muses, 
after two years of banishment, begin to flourish once more in Paris, 
and study and discipline are being restored."<sup><small><a name="n35"><a href="#n_35">{35}</a></a></small></sup> The struggle is over. 
The crisis has passed. Aristotle is fully recognized. Michael Scott may 
now put forth his translations of the Stagyrite. And in fact, it is 
precisely about this time, Roger Bacon tells us, that Michael Scott 
appears upon the scene, bringing with him especially the treatise on 
Physics with the commentaries thereon; and from this time forth 
Aristotle is held in high esteem by the Latins.<sup><small><a name="n36"><a href="#n_36">{36}</a></a></small></sup> It would seem as 
though the venerable Pontiff, with his far-reaching wisdom, had seen 
through the vista of the ages the extent of Aristotle's growing 
influence, and had resolved to crown his long and glorious career with 
this act of restoring his philosophy to its proper place. Now that 
Aristotle is enthroned, a new impetus is given to  the study of his 
writings.  <p>

same opinion : "Ce qui reste indubitable, c'est que le concile de 1209 
frappa l'Aristote arabe, traduit de l'arabe, expliqu&eacute; par des 
Arabes" (<i>Averro&euml;s et l'Averroisme</i>, p. 221). Haur&eacute;au, 
on the contrary, thinks the texts might have been genuine translations 
directly from the Greek (<i>Histoire de la Philosophie Scholastique</i>, 
tom. ii. pp. 100-105). Roger Bacon says expressly that the causes of 
the censure were false doctrines "and many passages erroneously 
translated." See Emile Charles, Roger Bacon, p. 422; see also ibid.,

<a name="n_20"><a href="#n20">{20}</a></a> Novisti siquidem quod dilectus filius magister Michael Scottis a 
puero inardescens amore scientiae litteralis, postpositis omnibus, 
illam studio continuato quaesivit et in fundamento artium gloriosas 
superedificans facultates decora se structura munivit, nec contentus 
littera tantum erudiri latina, et in ea melius formaretur, 
hebra&iuml;cae ac arabicae insudavit laudabiliter et profecit et sic 
doctus in singulis grata diversarum varietate nitescit (<i>Bulletin des 
Comit&eacute;s Historiques</i>, 1849-50, tom. ii. p. 255). The letter 
bears the date of April 28, 1227. It is written in order to remind the 
Archbishop of Canterbury that the proceeds of a certain benefice within 
his jurisdiction were reserved for Michael Scott by Honorius III., and 
that Gregory desires them to be continued in the same channel. "Thus," 
remarks the editor of this important letter, "in Scotch legend Michael 
Scott is the companion of demons; in history he is a client of the 
Pope," and, we may add, the beneficiary of another. It is difficult to 
reconstruct the life of Michael Scott. Bron about 1190; as early as 
1217 he began putting out translations of the Arabian commentators; 
about this time he passed over from Toledo to the court of Frederick;
his sojourn there was not more than ten years; in all probability he 
was in Rome about 1227; he afterwards resided and taught in Paris; 
about 1230 he began to issue translations of Aristotle -- one is 
dedicated to Gregory's friend Stephen of Provins; another MS. of his 
bears date of 1241. Some censure passed upon his writings by Albert the 
Great, and some praise and some abuse from Roger Bacon; this is all that 
is authentic of Michael Scott. Even this much escaped the notice of the 
writer of the very indefinite article on him in the <i>Encyclopaedia 
Britannica</i>. <p>

dedication runs as follows: -- "Tibi Stephane de Pruvino, hoc opus, 
quod ego Michael Scotus dedi latinitati ex dictis Aristotelis, 
specialiter commendo" (Jourdain, <i>Recherches Critiques sur les 
Traductions d'Aristote</i>, p. 127). <p>

<a name="n_32"><a href="#n32">{32}</a></a> This important document was the missing link in the chain of 
evidence the absence of which has led to so much confusion among the 
historians of this period of thought. It proves that the Church brought 
the remedy herself, and encouraged the study of Aristotle, instead of 
being silently overborne by the strong current in his favour, as is 
generally represented. Tiraboschi thinks the prohibition was confined 
to the University of Paris (<i>Storia della Letteratura Italiana</i>, 
tom. iv. p. 174). Talamo discusses the issue, but is not aware of the 
existence of this document (<i>L'Aristotelismo della  Scolastica nella 
Storia della Filosofia</i>, 1873). Emile Charles, in his able study 
upon Roger Bacon, also discusses the question, but does not use this 
document. We give the full text in an Appendix. <p>
