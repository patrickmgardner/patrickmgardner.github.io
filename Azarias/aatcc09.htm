<h1>IX.</h1>
<h2>LIMITATIONS OF THOUGHT.</h2><p>

IT is noteworthy that the great thinkers of this golden era of mediaeval 
thought were also saintly characters, and docile children of the 
Church. They appreciated the Faith that was in them, and knowing it to 
be a free and sovereign gift beyond their power of meriting, they 
sought to preserve and defend it by prayerful study. They ever kept 
in mind that the truths of Divine revelation are to be accepted on 
their own grounds; nor did they forget that the truths of reason, 
though coming home to them in another manner and upon different 
grounds, cannot in any sense contradict those of revelation; for they 
recognized that both revealed truth and natural truth are of God. They 
believed in the Supernatural Order. They held to a world of grace, 
above and beyond the world of Nature; each distinct in its kind; each a 
living reality. They regarded the Church as the visible medium through 
which these two worlds met and merged. She was to them the sacred 
repository of those Divine truths that human reason, by its own 
 <!--
Limitations of Thought. 77 
 --><A NAME="p77"></a>
 unaided lights, was unable to grasp; upon her authority alone did they 
accept them as certain. They held with St. Paul, that no man can think 
a good thought as of himself without the assistance of Him in Whom we 
live, move, and are.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> No more can he think the true, except as it is 
given him to think it, according to the primary conditions implanted in 
his rational nature, and in obedience to the laws of the human 
intellect. This has been clearly expressed by the great light and glory 
of the Schoolmen. "God helps man," says St. Thomas, "to understand that 
which He Himself directly proposes, not only by means of the object, or 
by increase of light; but the natural light that makes of man an 
intelligent being comes also from God; and furthermore, God being the 
Primary Truth from Whom all other truths derive their certitude -- even 
as in the demonstrative sciences, secondary propositions derive their 
certitude from the primary ones -- nothing could be certain in the 
intellect, save by Divine Power, just as in the sciences no conclusions 
are certain except by virtue of first principles."<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Accordingly, the Schoolmen drew clear lines between matters of faith 
and matters of reason. As clerics and monks, they studied philosophy, 
rarely for its own sake, 
 <!--
78 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p78"></a>
 frequently with view of developing, explaining, or defending the 
Christian truths, always in a spirit of docility to the Church. Nor 
were they, in accepting these religious limitations, labouring under 
any disadvantage.  Religion has answered many a pressing question long 
before reason had time to reach its solution. Was the rational solution 
any the less valid because the result to be reached was already known? 
Take those who broke down all barriers between the two orders. Have 
they derived therefrom any real benefit? There are the Neo-Platonists. 
They placed no bounds to their speculations; they indulged in the 
wildest vagaries, and called them systems; they sank all religious 
truth into their oriental imaginings; they were the all-knowing and the 
all-wise. Now, what real addition -- as the legitimate outcome of all 
their theorizings -- have they made to the sum of thought? What
 Neo-Platonic truth does the world accept to-day as of primary 
importance in life or in philosophy? Or take the Averroists. We have 
seen the havoc which they played amongst the Schoolmen. Leagued and 
sworn as they had been in every University, to propagate their 
doctrines; seriously as they threatened to overwhelm Christian science, 
to what purpose has it all been? In vain do we look for any clearly 
defined truth, or body of truths, that we can accept as an addition to 
mental or metaphysical science. All is lost in the arid sand
 <!--
Limitations of Thought 79 
 --><A NAME="p79"></a>
 of speculation. Can the same be said of their opponents? Who dares say 
-- knowing whereof he speaks -- that human thought is not the richer 
for the labours of an Aquinas and a Roger Bacon? And yet their faith 
was simple, their piety sincere, their loyalty and devotion to mother 
Church unswerving. Think you their religious belief hampered their 
scientific thought? To think so were to ignore the workings of the 
human mind and the primary laws of thought.  <p>

Thought must be free; thought is necessarily free. But it does not 
follow that thought has not its limitations. It has; it is restricted 
on many sides; and without restriction there is no continuous train of 
thought, and therefore no reasoning. A glance at the limitations of 
thought will enable us to understand its nature and its workings. To 
begin with, there are the essential limitations of reason, within which 
reason follows out certain laws and acts under certain conditions. The 
mind, as thinking-subject, must take itself for granted. Turn whither 
it will, the I-am-I of its own identity faces it as a fact, outside of 
which it cannot move. It must accept upon trust the acts of its memory. 
There is no thinking without receiving as truthfully reported that 
which the memory records. It must accept the primary principle of all 
demonstration,  <p>

"It is evident," says Aristotle, "that it is impossible for the same 
inquirer to suppose that at the same time 
 <!--
80 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p80"></a>
 the same thing should be and should not be."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> Even the reason of an 
Aristotle, searching and acute though it be, cannot work without that 
principle, nor can it by any possible ingenuity transgress its 
limitation. In like manner, is it equally impossible for the human 
intellect to think two and two to be three, or five, or aught else than 
four. It may, in reasoning upon erroneous or ill-understood premises, 
deduce a consequence that were equivalent to the proposition that two 
and two make three or make five; we all of us do it in a measure when 
we overleap or fall short of the truth. But the moment the intellect 
perceives its error, however slow it may be to express that it was in 
the wrong, it rebounds at once to its normal condition and thinks the 
eternal truth that two and two make four. For the intellect can only 
think the true as true.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Nor are those primary conditions and 
accompaniments of thinking its only limitations.  <p>

Thought has also its restrictions from without. There is the restraint 
of menta1 discipline, in which the will compels the intellect to 
exclude all matters extraneous to that upon which it is then and there 
occupied, and to 
 <!--
Limitations of Thought.  81
 --><A NAME="p81"></a>
 move in a given direction. Without this strain there is no real 
thinking; without it, it were impossible to prolong a train of thought 
to its legitimate conclusion, or properly to exhaust the consideration 
of a proposition. There is the restriction of language. Our thought 
takes colour and shape from the speech in which it is expressed.  
Our very idioms mould its form. Take any subject; submit its treatment 
to a French and a German mind; you will find the genius of each 
language materially affecting the respective thoughts of each 
intellect.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> Then there is the restriction of the schools. Each school 
has its own mould of expression. The disciple thinks in the terms of his 
school. In all his reasoning he is on his guard against admitting any 
form of expression that might be construed into an admission of the 
views of another school. This is a great hardship, frequently a great 
tyranny, for the human intellect. It drags it into partisanship. The 
disciple of Schopenhauer feels in duty bound to tear Hegel to tatters. 
The Agnostic is not happy unless he is abusing religion as the enemy of 
material progress. To belong exclusively to any one school of thought 
is to shut out from one's soul all truth but that which presents itself 
under a given aspect. It is to be continually asking the question,  
 <!--
82 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p82"></a>
 Can any good come out of Nazareth? And yet good can come out of 
Nazareth; every Nazareth of thought has its own lesson to teach us if 
we willingly learn it and put it to profit. Finally, there is the 
intellectual atmosphere of the day, in which thought lives and moves. 
It cannot exist without breathing this air. If the past is revived, it 
lives only in proportion as it is brought to bear upon the present. 
Unconsciously do we breathe this atmosphere. It enters into our 
language; it moulds our phrases; it colours our thinking. It is a 
subtle essence ever present yet ever eluding our grasp. <p>

Now, the atmosphere of the golden era of the Middle Ages, is the Spirit 
of Faith. It speaks in the Crusades. It breathes in the Gothic 
cathedral. It is the inspiration alike of Dante and Aquinas. All the 
great intellects of that epoch breathed this atmosphere of Faith. It 
gave life and colour to their thoughts. It raised them above themselves 
into the supernatural life which they touched and felt as a living 
reality. Scepticism was foreign to the minds of an Albert, a 
Bonaventura, a Thomas, and a Roger Bacon. Therefore, in all their 
studies and speculations they were as little disturbed and under no 
greater restraint than was Plato or Aristotle. To one whose doubts are 
his life -- whose sole object is the pursuit of truth whilst sceptical 
of its existence -- this frame of mind is indeed an enigma; but it is 
no less a fact. No religious believer finds embarrassment in hold<!--
Limitations of Thought. 83  
 --><A NAME="p83"></a>ing by truths of Faith and at the same time carrying out a course 
of reasoning as freely as the most confirmed sceptic. His conclusion 
may be found to clash with some article of his Faith. Be it so. The 
revealed truth has possession. That admits of no revision. Not so the 
conclusion. Experience has taught the reasoner how likely he is to go 
astray in pursuing a line of argument; how frequently some misplaced or 
some ill-understood term has stolen into his premises and vitiated the 
whole of his reasoning; or how some fact has been overlooked, in 
consequence of which he finds his conclusion at variance with existing 
facts. In all such instances, his only remedy is to revise his chain of 
reasoning and rid himself of the cause of the fallacy running through 
it. Therefore, should he perceive any such discrepancy, it remains for 
him to go over his whole argument once more; and should he still find 
no error, or if he is yet unable to bring his conclusion into harmony 
with the revealed truth, he is not thereby disturbed. He awaits 
additional light flowing from a larger experience and more advanced 
science. The overhasty conclusion has damaged science; the overhasty 
censure has brought odium upon religion. To him who has learned how to 
labour and how to wait the light comes. This is the lesson of the 
history of thought. Never yet has a revealed truth stood in the way of 
a scientific truth rightly demonstrated. On the contrary, he 
 <!--
84 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p84"></a>
 who is possessed of the great truths of revealed religion, and holds 
them with a grasp of living conviction, has always a norm with which to 
compare and adjust any other truths coming within the domain of those 
that are of revelation. He is saved time and trouble; he treads the 
mazes of thought with a firm step; he brings his investigations into 
other spheres of study with a calm spirit. Here is to be found the 
inspiring principle of the great intellects of mediaeval days. <p>
