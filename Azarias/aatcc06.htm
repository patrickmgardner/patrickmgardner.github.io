<h2>ARISTOTLE AMONG THE ARABS.</h2><p>

THE Mussulman Philosophy was not simply that of Aristotle. An 
undercurrent of Arabian thought flowed around the older system and gave 
it a special drift and tendency. This also passed over to the 
Schoolmen, and brought with it problems all its own which they were 
compelled to face and refute as best they could. It is only by noting 
the bearings of this current, deep and narrow and strong, that we can 
understand and appreciate the drift of many an argument and many a 
proposition in the Philosophy of the Schools. It is the clue to what 
would otherwise seem enigmatic or irrelevant. The Arabian is a sterile 
intellect. It cannot invent; it cannot originate. It has brought to the 
whole sphere of thought not a single addition that posterity thinks 
worth preserving. It simply cultivated and transmitted the sciences 
which it had received from its Syrian Christian masters. Its chief 
merit, in the estimate of history, is that it preserved and brought 
back to Europe the current of thought and of study that had been 
tem<!--

 --><A NAME="p34"></a>porarily diverted. True, it made progress in medicine; but medicine 
it received from Galen; moreover, it is a recognized fact that the 
chief physicians in the courts of the Califs were Christians. It made 
progress in algebra; but algebra it received from the Greek Diaphantus. 
It gave us the Arabian numbers; but these it received from its Hindu 
kinsfolk. The Arabians were not linguists. Syrians and Jews translated 
their scientific works either from the Greek, the Syriac, or the 
Hebrew. They were plain-thinking children of the desert, who, finding 
themselves masters of cultured races, went to school to them, and 
received from them whatever knowledge it was within their intellectual 
capacity to imbibe. Their narrow religious training limited the scope 
of the subjects upon which they were allowed to receive instruction 
from strangers. At first their schooling was confined to the study of 
medicine and the natural sciences. But soon a taste for philosophical 
speculation grew upon them. Their master, guide, and almost sole 
authority was Aristotle. It was an authority that monopolized the 
cultured Mohammedan intellect even to the exclusion of the Kor&acirc;n. 
Hence the struggle between philosophy and orthodoxy, which raged for 
centuries and ended only with the triumph of the Kor&acirc;n. <p>

Throughout the contest, the attitude of the popular mind was one of 
antagonism to all philosophy. Every philosopher was a heretic who had 
frequently to submit  
 <!--
Aristotle among the Arabs. 35
 --><A NAME="p35"></a>
 to persecutions and indignities, sometimes from the people, and 
sometimes from those in high places who courted the popular favour. 
Every man given to study was a suspect. Al-Kendi, though the friend of 
the Calif Al-Mamoun, and charged by him with the translation of 
Aristotle, does not escape the eye of jealousy. He is calumniated and 
persecuted, and Al-M&oacute;tawakkel confiscates his library.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> The 
mosques rang with denunciations of Aristotle, Al-Farabi, and especially 
Avicenna. In Bagdad, in 1150, all the philosophical works from the 
library of a Kadhi are burnt.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> In 1192, the operation is repeated 
upon the works of another philosopher. We are told of a certain
 Ibn-Habib, of Seville, who is put to death by the Sultan "because it 
was proved against him that he worked secretly at philosophy."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

We read of Avempace that "he was the banner of his age and the phoenix 
of his time in the philosophical sciences, for which reason he was 
greatly exposed to the shafts of malice."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Ibn-Khakan wrote a severe 
satire against him, in which he called him a calamity for religion, an 
affliction for those who are in the good way.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> The great Ibn-Roschd, 
after having basked in the sunshine of  
 <!--
36 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p36"></a>
 court favour for many years, finds himself persecuted at the end of 
his life, and his works everywhere proscribed.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> The historian Makrizi 
sums up the popular feeling against philosophy when he writes: "The 
theorizings of philosophers have been the cause of more direful evils 
than can be mentioned to religion among the Mussulmans. Philosophy has 
served merely to increase the errors of heretics and add to their 
impiety an additional impiety."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> The struggle continues during four 
centuries. At last philosophy falls into utter disrepute; the spirit of 
study becomes extinct; the Kor&acirc;n triumphs. If the writings of the 
great intellects of Arabia would be preserved, they must be translated 
into Hebrew or written in Hebrew characters.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Such being the soil, 
let us now examine the philosophical growth that sprung from it. <p>

From Syria and from Persia did the Mussulman get the first breath of 
intellectual freedom that inspired him to rebel against the suffocating 
thraldom of the Kor&acirc;n.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> There he learned that he was a free and 
responsible agent. There he was initiated into that mysticism that  
 <!--<p>

Aristotle among the Arabs. 37 
 -->
 taught intimate union with the Godhead. Both these truths were 
heretical. But a century has scarcely elapsed since Mohammed imposed 
the fatalism of the Koran upon his people, when these doctrines begin 
to be discussed and to divide the faithful into rival camps. 
W&acirc;cel ben-'Atha (699-748), chased from the school of Hasan 
because of his unorthodox opinions, reduced for the first time the 
teachings of the Kadrites, or those believing in freedom of will, to a 
scientific system. His school held a medium ground between the faithful 
and the heretics. It endeavoured to reconcile reason with faith. Its 
fundamental doctrine was the efficacy of reason to discover all man's 
moral obligations and all truths necessary for salvation, independently 
of any religious code.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> The disciples of this school were known as 
the Mot&eacute;callamin.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> Such was the condition of Islamite thought 
when the writings of Aristotle raised it out of its apathy into 
intellectual regions, for it, as new and as wonderful as anything 
revealed by the fabled lamp of Aladdin. <p>

From the Metaphysics of the Grecian philosopher, men drew forth the 
theory of the eternity of matter and the denial of all human attributes 
of God in the sense of the Koran. Others wished to reconcile the 
doctrine  
 <!--
38 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p38"></a>
 of creation with this doctrine of absence of all attributes in God. 
Even God could not create without willing to do so. How overcome the 
difficulty? By means of a mental fiction. They conceive attributes 
existing without a substratum. Therefore will may so exist; and this is 
the will by which God creates.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> Again, some would deny causality. To 
account for sequence, they invented the fiction that accidents are 
things created, positive and independent of any substance of inherence. 
For instance, I write. In this act, say they, are four accidents 
created directly for the purpose: that of the will to move the pen, 
that of the faculty of moving. that of the motion of the hand, and that 
of the motion of the pen.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> Childish doctrines these, becoming a people 
grappling with problems beyond their ken. They held, in opposition to 
the fatalism of the Kor&acirc;n, that God's providence extends to things 
universal alone, and not to the singular or the accidental. But in 
accordance with Gnostic teachings, they invented intermediate worlds 
and creations that accounted for the actions of the singular and the 
individual.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> Their intellectual cravings were fed upon any number of  
 <!--
Aristotle among the Arabs. 39 
 --><A NAME="p39"></a>
 spurious works. They had false writings of Pythagoras; they had false 
writings of Plato; they had false writings of Empedocles, who was a 
great favourite among them, and in whose name a philosophical sect was 
established; they had false writings of Aristotle, more orthodox than 
Aristotle's own.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> And there was a Jewish tradition to account for this 
orthodox work. Aristotle, we are told, became converted by Simeon the 
Just, and renounced his doctrine concerning the eternity of the world, 
and all other opinions which he had held in contradiction with the 
doctrines of Moses.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup><p>

But the problem that overshadowed all others in Arabian philosophy was 
the problem of knowing. Aristotle is both indefinite and unsatisfactory 
in his treatment of this problem. How does reason, which is immaterial, 
think the material? Where is the, bond of connection? Aristotle places 
it in the creative reason. He tells us that reason is a becoming of all 
things -- <b>t&ocirc; panta ginesthai</b> -- and a making of all things 
-- <b>ho de t&ocirc; panta poiein</b>.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> He further explains the 
difference between this creative reason and the receptive reason: the 
creative reason is never at rest; it is eternally active; it does not 
at one time think and at another time not think; it alone is immortal 
and eternal; it leaves us no memory of this unceasing work of thought 
because it is unaffected  
 <!--<p>

40 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 -->
 by its object;<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> the receptive, passive reason is perishable, and can 
really think nothing without the support of the creative intellect.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The Arabian philosophers forthwith undertook to account for the 
existence of this mysterious creative intellect. They found the 
solution in the apocryphal Theology of Aristotle. They read how God, in 
contemplating His most absolute and true unity, formed the Supreme 
Creative Intellect.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> This is first in a series of intelligences from 
which finally is derived the creative intellect of which Aristotle 
speaks. The mode of evolution is somewhat in this manner: There are 
nine celestial spheres.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> Soul is the principle of their motion. That 
motion is circular, and supposes the conception of a particular end, 
and therefore thought or intelligence.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> This implies desire. The 
object of desire is the Supreme Intelligence. But the difference in 
motion is due to difference in desire. Therefore each sphere should 
have, besides the Supreme Intelligence, an inferior intelligence to 
regulate its movements. There exist, then, nine other intelligences 
emanated from the Supreme Intelligence. They are known as separated 
intelligences.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> The lowest of these separated intelli<!--
 Aristotle among the Arabs. 41
 --><A NAME="p41"></a>gences which presides over the motions of the sphere nearest us -- 
the moon -- is the active intelligence by whose influence the passive 
or material -- hylic -- intellect within us is made active, and becomes 
the intellect in act. When it comes to be always in act, it is known as 
the Acquired or Emanated Intellect. To attain to this state is the end 
of all striving after perfection.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

In this manner have Arabian philosophers given the creative intellect a 
local habitation and a name. This creative intellect they conceived as 
the sole intellect of humanity, into which all others are merged. "The 
soul," says Averro&euml;s, "is not divided up according to the number 
of individuals; it is one and the same in Socrates and in Plato; the 
intellect has no individuality; individuation comes only from 
sensibiiity."<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> Did Averro&euml;s or any of the Arabian philosophers 
mean by this creative intellect "a living and permanent humanity?"<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> 
The very genesis of the intellect in Arabian philosophy which we have 
given, is in itself sufficient answer. This proves it to be a thing 
apart from humanity -- a distinct creation -- to the level  
 <!--
45 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p45"></a>
 of which a favoured few may attain, and this is all. It is easy and 
convenient to see the fictions of the present in those of the past.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup><p>

We can only glance at the names of those Arabian philosophers, whose 
impress may be traced in the philosophy of the Schools. Al-Farabi (d. 
950), was one of the great lights of Arabian philosophy. It is 
noteworthy that he studied under a Christian teacher, John
 Bar-Gil&acirc;n. Maimonides says that "all he composed, and specially 
his work on the principles of things, is of the pure flour of the 
wheat."<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> But Ibn-Tofa&iuml;l finds in his works many contradictions. 
He taught that there was no happiness for the large majority of men 
beyond that of the present life. That man should become a separate 
substance in another life, he called old women's tales.<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> The Supreme 
Good is attainable only by those possessed of perfect intellectual 
organizations and every way apt to receive the impression of the active 
intellect. But his commentaries upon the Logic were quoted with 
approval by the Schoolmen; William of Auvergne, Albert the Great, and 
Vincent of Beauvais made frequent use of them. "He opened," says 
Haur&eacute;au, "to  
 <!--<p>

Aristotle among the Arabs. 43 
 -->
 our Scholastic doctors, as logician, ways which Ab&eacute;lard had never 
imagined."<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Ibn-Sina -- Avicenna -- (980-1037), was the greatest medical authority 
among the Arabians. He made his studies under a Christian physician, 
'Isa ben-Ya'hya. In the domain of philosophy he is no less eminent. "He 
can be considered," says Munk, "as the greatest representative of the 
Peripateticism of the Middle Ages."<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> He gave Albert the Great the 
model of his commentaries upon Aristotle. His division of the faculties 
of the soul is that which has been adopted by nearly all mediaeval and 
modern philosophers. His distinction of the animal faculty by which 
beasts form a judgment -- <i>vis aestimativa</i> -- has been accepted 
in Scholastic nomenclature as a permanent contribution to philosophical 
science.<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> But though Avicenna in his endeavour to be conservative 
had made many concessions to the Kor&acirc;n, he still found but small 
favour at the hands of his brethren. <p>

Al-Gazali (1058-1111), was known as "the proof of Islamism and the 
ornament of religion." His was an intensely religious nature which 
received no satisfaction from any of the philosophical systems of 
his day. After 
 <!--
44 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p44"></a>
 examining them all, he found himself landed in scepticism. He 
distrusted his senses; he distrusted his intellectual faculties. "Are 
we sure," he asks, "that there will not be another state for us which 
will be to our waking-mood what our waking-mood now is to our
 sleeping-mood, so that on arriving at this new state, we should be 
forced to acknowledge that what we had believed true by means of our 
reason was but a dream without any reality?"<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup> A question this, which 
is still asked and answered, now affirmatively, now negatively, 
according to individual bias and prejudice.<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup> He grew sceptical of 
reason, only to throw himself into the arms of religion with all the 
greater fervour. In the mysticism of the S&ucirc;fis were the yearnings 
of his soul satisfied.<sup><small><a name="n35"><a href="#n_35">{35}</a></a></small></sup> The writings and the influence of Al-Gazali 
extinguished the philosophical spirit in the East. It took its flight 
into Spain. <p>

Ibn-Badj&agrave; -- Avempace  -- (1090-1138), domesticated Arabian 
philosophy upon Spanish soil. We have already seen how his brilliant 
talents made him enemies. He  
 <!--<p>

Aristotle among the Arabs. 45
 -->
 died comparatively young, but not before he had laid his impress upon 
his age. He it was who first developed the all-absorbing doctrine of 
the unity of souls. He also attempted to show how the soul may raise 
itself up to union with the active intellect.<sup><small><a name="n36"><a href="#n_36">{36}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Ibn-Tofail -- Abubacer -- (1100-1185), was more successful over the 
same problem. Upon a groundwork of fiction he goes to show that there 
is no contradiction between the truths of religion and those of 
science. The hero of his story<sup><small><a name="n37"><a href="#n_37">{37}</a></a></small></sup> is born and raised away from society, 
and by the unaided light of reason, arrives at mystical union with the 
Godhead.<sup><small><a name="n38"><a href="#n_38">{38}</a></a></small></sup> He meets another solitary, who has reached the same point 
from prayer and meditation upon the Kor&acirc;n. They compare notes and 
find that upon all essential truths they are of one accord. Hayy, in 
the first flush of his joy, is desirous of announcing this discovery to 
his fellow-men. The solitary, who has been among men and knows the 
world, would dissuade his companion from the enterprise; but to no 
purpose. They both set out together. Hayy is well received at first; 
but when he begins to explain his philosophy he is given the cold 
shoulder. Finding his task unappreciated, he leaves in disgust, and 
with his  
 <!--<p>

46 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 -->
 companion returns to a life of severity and contemplation.<sup><small><a name="n39"><a href="#n_39">{39}</a></a></small></sup> Abubacer 
was thus expressing the strong popular prejudice against the purest 
doctrine imparted with the purest intentions when presented under the 
name of philosophy. But his influence upon Scholasticism was of an 
indirect nature. <p>

Ibn-Roschd -- Averro&euml;s -- (1126-1198), was patronized and 
encouraged by Abubacer, who has been called the artisan of his 
fortunes. He was the Arabian philosopher whose influence was most 
profoundly impressed upon Scholasticism. Coming into immediate contact 
and relation with the great men of his day, he absorbed all the 
learning and spirit of Arabian science. His love for philosophy grew 
into a passion and a species of religion. "The only religion for 
philosophers," he said, "is to make profound study of whatever exists; 
for we can render unto God no more sublime worship than that of knowing 
His works, which causes us to know Himself in all His reality."<sup><small><a name="n40"><a href="#n_40">{40}</a></a></small></sup> His 
love and admiration for Aristotle knew no bounds. "This man," he says, 
"has been the rule of Nature and a model in which she seeks to express 
the type of the last perfection."<sup><small><a name="n41"><a href="#n_41">{41}</a></a></small></sup> He epitomized Aristotle; he 
paraphrased Aristotle; he commented 
 <!--
Aristotle among the Arabs. 47 
 --><A NAME="p47"></a>
 upon Aristotle. These three operations were known as his three 
commentaries. He was called emphatically the Commentator. St. Thomas 
learned and followed his method. We are told by his biographer that it 
was a novel and peculiar one.<sup><small><a name="n42"><a href="#n_42">{42}</a></a></small></sup> Like Averro&euml;s,<sup><small><a name="n43"><a href="#n_43">{43}</a></a></small></sup> St. Thomas did 
not know the language of Aristotle,<sup><small><a name="n44"><a href="#n_44">{44}</a></a></small></sup> But he got Brother William of 
Moerbek to make translations directly from the Greek.<sup><small><a name="n45"><a href="#n_45">{45}</a></a></small></sup> He procured 
other versions also from the Greek. These he compared and collated. 
With a reverence bordering upon veneration,<sup><small><a name="n46"><a href="#n_46">{46}</a></a></small></sup> and after the manner of 
the great commentary of Averro&euml;s, he studied the Master word for 
word and line for line. Note the caution with which he proceeds. Here 
he explains a passage; there he refutes; in another place he attempts 
to impose an orthodox sense upon what, at first reading, would seem 
opposed to the Christian spirit.<sup><small><a name="n47"><a href="#n_47">{47}</a></a></small></sup>
 <!--
48 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p48"></a>
 Still, for two centuries the great Commentator continues to overshadow 
the Schools. He is quoted, commented, and refuted. Through him all the 
errors of Arabian philosophy are transplanted within the very shadow of 
the Church, and together with those of Aristotle, produce a plentiful 
harvest of disputes, criminations and un-Christian doctrines. It will 
be our task to trace their growth and influence through the varying 
fortunes of the Master Mind of both Christian and Arab. <p>

Thomas studied Aristotle in the Latin versions made from the Hebrew 
(<i>M&eacute;langes</i>, p. 335). Their first readings of Aristotle may 
have been from such versions. But St. Thomas used only versions made 
from the Greek in his commentaries. Jourdain tells us that he 
frequently cites and compares two such versions. The commentary upon 
the Metaphysics shows that three distinct versions. from the Greek were 
used. Jourdain refers to no less than fifteen instances as proof. And 
yet Monk gives Jourdain as his authority for saying that St. Thomas 
studied Aristotle in Latin versions made from the Hebrew. See Jourdain, 
<i>Recherches critiques sur les Traductions d'Aristote</i>, pp. 40, 41. <p>
