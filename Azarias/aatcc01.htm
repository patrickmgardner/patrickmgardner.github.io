<h1>I.</h1>  
<h2>ATTITUDE OF THE CHURCH TOWARDS PHILOSOPHY.</h2><p>

A PRELIMINARY statement that will prevent grave misconception in the 
course of the following pages, is this: The Church is not in any sense 
a School of Philosophy; she is a living, organic body, informed by the 
Holy Spirit for the regeneration of the world. With this view does she 
teach definite doctrines, and inculcate definite practices, and, by 
means of the prayer of ritual and ceremonial and sacramental blessing, 
impart to men grace and strength to live up to her teachings. Her 
Divine Founder was of no School; He was bound by no system; He defined 
not; He gave no syllogistic demonstrations. With a sublime simplicity, 
in the power of the Divinity alone to assume, He laid down His 
doctrines, confirmed His disciples, and organized His 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p2"></a>
 Church. Whatever was good and humanizing in the Mosaic law He 
retained; all that was harsh and hardening He abolished, and taught by 
precept and example the universal law of Love. And the Church, like the 
Truth on which she is founded, has ever remained above all systems and 
all schools. She allows her children, as best they can, in the light of 
such philosophic truth as they find at hand, to endeavour to explain 
her doctrines and her dogmas. Being a living organism, she speaks to 
each age in the language that each age best understands. And so it 
happens that, in defining and affirming the doctrines of which she is 
the sacred depository, as against schism or heresy, she from time to 
time adopts some term or other from the prevailing philosophic school
 -- when that term most clearly expresses her thought. In the Catechism 
that she places in the hands of the child just arrived at the age of 
reason, she teaches in philosophical language the nature of the 
Sacraments that she administers; and in distinguishing between what 
constitutes their Matter, and what their Form, she is using a 
nomenclature familiar to the Schools hundreds of years before her 
Divine Founder breathed into her His sanctifying Spirit. <p>

Thus it is that, under her influence, "doctrines concerning the nature 
of God, the immortality of the soul, and the duties of men, which the 
noblest intellects of antiquity could barely grasp, have become the 
truisms of 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p3"></a>
 the village school, the proverbs of the cottage and the alley."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> All 
this is to be looked for in a living organism addressing herself; not 
to one portion of humanity, but to every portion, be it of the learned 
or the ignorant, of the rich or the poor, of the savage or the 
civilized. Hers must needs be a teaching and a practice to satisfy 
intellect as well as heart. She must needs contain within herself a 
fulness and a wealth of grace to calm the stormy heart, and of truth to 
bring repose to the restless brain of an Augustine, to satisfy the 
intellectual cravings of a Novalis and a Frederick Schiegel, and to 
meet the questionings of the acute intellect of a Cardinal Newman. But 
if she were not equal to all this, would her Divine Founder ever have 
spoken of Himself as the Fountain of living waters, at which whoso 
drinks will never feel thirst?<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> And therefore it is, that as she 
grows with the growth of the ages, is she found equal to the wants of 
every age. Whatever there is of the good, or the true, or the 
beautiful; whatever tends to bring home to a people's heart her sublime 
teachings; whatever appeals to man's highest reason, and satisfies his 
noblest aspirations, she absorbs and assimilates and presents for his 
contemplation, blessed and purified and consecrated as an instrument 
of holiness. There is no truth too elevated for her grasp; there is no 
detail too trivial to be 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p4"></a>
 beneath her notice, if it can only avail for the main purpose. Jesus 
comes to establish a regenerative religion. He takes up His abode 
amongst that people the most intensely religious upon the face of the 
earth. He establishes the Christian principle. And an impartial witness 
to the worth of that principle says of it: "Infinitely greater and more 
fruitful than Jewish tradition, the Christian principle was large 
enough to comprise all, and powerful enough to absorb all. . . . All 
that speculation conceived of the profound and elevated in metaphysics, 
all that practical good sense found most certain and most efficacious 
in morality, Christianity hastened to gather up and make its own."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The disciple whom Jesus loved in an especial manner, and who fully 
understood the spirit of the New Religion, before recording the sayings 
and doings of his Master, premised his Gospel with a vindication of the 
Godhead of Jesus, and with giving, in opposition to the teachings of 
Philo (circ. B.C. 25 to circ. A.D. 50) and the Alexandrian School, a 
proper place in Christian philosophy, to the Word, in language as 
clear, simple, and sublime as  
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p5"></a>
 ever dropped from the pen of inspiration. Therein does he establish 
the co-eternity of the Word with the Father: <i>In the beginning was 
the Word, and the Word was with God</i>. According to Philo, the Word 
was a mere attribute of God: now the Divine Reason, now the Divine 
Creative Power, now the child of His wisdom; never God Himself.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> John 
identifies the Word with the Godhead, and states His Divine 
Personality: <i>And the Word was God . . . In Him was life, and the 
life was the Light of men. . . . And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt 
amongst us.</i><sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> Henceforth in Christian philosophy Jesus shall be 
known as the Word, bringing to men light and life, regeneration and 
redemption. This is the touchstone of all systems: <i>By this is the 
Spirit of God known. Every spirit, which confesseth that Jesus Christ 
is come in the flesh, is of God: And every spirit that dissolveth 
Jesus, is not of God.</i><sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> And yet, though an inspired Gospel, in a 
sublime preamble, dissolves the philosophical myths in which vain 
imaginings would cloud the Divinity of Jesus, it is not as a system of 
philosophy competing with other systems that the Church steps upon the 
world's scene. The trained intellect of a St. Paul contrasting her 
simple teaching with Hellenic culture, on the one hand, finds it to be 
foolishness for the Greek; on the other hand, com<!--

 --><A NAME="p6"></a>paring it with Jewish history and Jewish traditions, he calls it a 
stumbling-block to the Jew.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Still, the Gnosticism of the day 
concentrated all its energies in a desperate struggle to crush out of 
existence the foolishness and the stumbling-block. St. Paul raises his 
voice against the false science that has crept into the Church, and 
cautions Timothy not to allow himself to be ensnared by fables and 
genealogies without end,<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> and to avoid foolish and unlearned questions, 
knowing that they beget strifes.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> We know what havoc this Gnosticism 
played in the early Church. That the world was the work of a delirious 
God; that the body was evil in itself; that only an elect few were 
redeemed, only an elect few were predestined to salvation: such were 
some of its most pernicious doctrines, which were carried out to their 
full consequences in all the affairs of social and daily life, Loud 
and fierce did those winds blow; but the Church calmly abided her hour, 
and the truth prevailed. So was it with the Alexandrian School, with 
her strange jumble of doctrine. Hard, indeed, were it for the world to 
become regenerate upon a syncretism in which attempt was made to 
reconcile Plato with Aristotle, Chaldaic theurgic rites with Judaic 
mysticism. It was the last bulwark thrown up by an exhausted and 
expiring civilization against the encroachments of Christianity. It 
failed; and the Church continued her mission of regenerating and 
reconstructing the world. <p>

have occasion to note a practical application of their truth. <p>
