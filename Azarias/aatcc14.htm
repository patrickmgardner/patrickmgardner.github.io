<h2>APPENDIX.</h2><p>

We here give the full text of the important letter of Gregory IX., 
appointing a commission to examine and expurge the prohibited books of 
Aristotle. That the W in the letter stands for William of Auxerre, is 
confirmed beyond a shadow of doubt by the other letters of Gregory to 
the King and Queen of France, quoted by Du Boulay (<i>Historia 
Universitatis Parisiensis</i>, tom. iii. p. 145), in which the name --  
<i>Willielmum Antissiodorensem</i> -- is given in full. It will be 
noticed that Gregory makes use of a Scriptural allusion which is a 
favourite one with both Jerome and Origen when impressing the necessity 
of studying secular letters. The original document is in the 
Biblioth&eacute;que Nationale (Suppl. lat. num., 1575), where it was 
brought to light by M. La Porte du Theil, and transcribed by M. 
Haur&eacute;au into the <i>Notices et Extraits des Manuscrits</i>, tom. 
xxi. partie ii. p. 222. <p>

"Cum sapientiae sacrae paginae reliquae scientiae debeant famulari, eatenus 
sunt a fidelibus amplectendae quatenus obsequi dinoscuntur beneplacitis

 numero captivorum mulier speciosa, non aliter in domum permittitur 
introduci, nisi rasa superfluitatis caesarie, ac unguibus lacerantibus 
circumcisis; et, ut spoliatis AEgyptiis ditentur Hebraei, jubentur vasa 
aurea et argentea pretiosa, non aeruginosa, aenea, vel lignea, mutuari. 
Ceterum cum, sicut intelleximus, libri Naturalium, qui Parisiis in 
concilio provinciali fuere prohibiti, quaedam utilia et inutilia 
continere dicantur, ne utile per inutile vitietur, discretioni vestrae, 
de qua plenam in Domino fiduciam obtinemus, per apostolica scripta, sub 
obtestatione divini judicii, firmiter praecipiendo mandamus, quatenus 
libros ipsos examinantes, sicut convenit, subtiliter et prudenter, quae
ibi erronea, seu scandali, vel offendiculi, legentibus inveneritis 
illataava, penitus resecetis, ut, quae sunt suspecta remotis, 
incunctanter ac inoffense in reliquis studeatur.

"As other sciences ought to minister to the wisdom of Holy Writ, the 
Faithful should embrace them according as they perceive them giving 
willing service to the sovereign master; so that should aught of poison 
or other vicious thing be found in them calculated to diminish 
the purity of the Faith, the same should be cast far away. Thus the 
beautiful woman found among the captives was not permitted to he 
brought into the house till her hair was shaven and her nails were cut. 
Thus, that the Hebrews might grow rich with the spoils of the 
Egyptians, they were commanded to borrow their precious vases of gold 
and silver, leaving aside those of brass, copper, or wood. Having 
learned, then, that certain books of natural philosophy, which were 
prohibited by the Provincial Council of Paris, are said to contain 
things useful and baneful, and lest the baneful should mar the useful, 
We strongly enjoin upon your discretion, in which We place full 
confidence, by these Apostolic letters, under invocation of the Divine 
judgment, to examine those books with as minute care and prudence as 
behove, and to remove whatever is erroneous, or of scandal, or in the 
least offensive to the readers, so that after the severe pruning of all 
suspected passages, what remains, may, without delay and without 
danger, be restored to study.
