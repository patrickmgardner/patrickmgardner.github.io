128 Aristotle and the Christian Church.  
 --><A NAME="p128"></a>
<h1>XIII.</h1>
<h2>CONCLUSION.</h2><p>

THIS outline will enable us to form some conception of the relations of 
Aristotle to the Christian Church. Let us review those relations from 
our present vantage-ground. A great philosopher comes among men. He 
reduces thought and the expression of thought to a science. He teaches 
the secret of method; he shows how to define and to divide; he 
initiates into the mode of observing and classifying the facts of 
nature, and of constructing the natural sciences. The wonderful grasp 
of his genius takes hold of the human intellect in the East and in the 
West, and marks out for it the grooves in which it shall think and the 
very terms and forms of expression it shall use for all time. Other 
geniuses may charm the human intellect, and be suggestive of thought 
and systems of thought, but it is only Aristotle who has been able to 
impose upon humanity his very forms of thought and expression to that 
extent that they are to-day as much part of our thinking as the idioms 
of our speech. And there is no department of human science to which his 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p129"></a>
 dominion does not extend. His least hint runs along lines of study age 
after age till we find it finally blossoming into some great discovery. 
He states, for instance, that this world is not very large; that there 
is only one sea between the country at the Pillars of Hercules and 
India; and that communication between their coasts is neither 
incredible nor impossible.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> That stray remark is transmitted down the 
ages until it falls into the hands of a Columbus, and forthwith it 
shapes his destiny and leads to the finding of a new world. Here is how 
Columbus speaks "Aristotle says that this world is small, that there is 
little water, and that one could easily pass from Spain into Media. 
Avouruyz<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> confirms this idea, and Cardinal Peter d'Aliaco<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> cites 
it, supporting this opinion, which is conformable to that of Seneca, by 
saying that Aristotle might know many secret things of this world on 
account of Alexander the Great."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Thus it is that even America cannot 
be discovered without having connected with it the name of Aristotle.  <p>

The Church, in her mission of renovating the world and raising it up 
into a higher plane of thought and action, makes use of the human 
instruments at her command. She is not exclusive. Her activity extends 
to all classes -- to the ignorant and the learned, to the  
 <!--
130 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p130"></a>
 rich and the poor. To each does she speak in the language each best 
understands. And in speaking to the human intelligence, she has made 
use of that language most clearly expressed by the human intelligence, 
and has drawn from that philosophy which has left the most profound 
impress upon human thought. In her teachings concerning the sacraments 
she has applied the Aristotelian doctrine of Matter and Form, of 
Substance and Accidence. In her moral and intellectual philosophy, when 
speaking of the human soul and its faculties, of virtues and vices, of 
habits and passions, she has adopted Aristotle's definitions and 
divisions of subjects. And thus has the language of this Pagan 
philosopher become the medium by which the most sacred teachings and 
the most awful mysteries of the Church are conveyed to the human 
understanding. Nor would Aristotle take amiss this use of his writings. 
He realized the sacred ministry of philosophy. He considered it the 
most Divine and the most elevated of all subjects, since it treats of 
God and of things Divine; "for," he adds, "according to the avowal of 
the whole human race, God is the Cause and Principle of Things."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Indeed, it is noteworthy in those days of secularization, when men in 
all departments of science seek to do without God, even to the ignoring 
of His very existence, how scrupulously the Pagan philosopher, in all 
his 
 <!--
Conclusion. 131 
 --><A NAME="p131"></a>
 studies, keeps ever in mind the Divinity. Is he dealing with first 
principles of science and thought? As the crowning-point of his 
speculations, back of all elementary truths, he discerns and 
acknowledges the Living Truth Who is their source.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> Is he 
contemplating the starry heavens? He reads in their motion, as clearly 
as the Psalmist ever read, the resplendent glory of their Prime-Mover. 
God is the end for which they exist; He is the Life of all life, the 
Mover of all motion, and the Eternal Source of all time.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Is he 
fathoming the problems of time and space, of motion and rest, of the 
finite and the infinite? Again, in his gropings after light, through 
the mists of those obscure questionings, rays of the Divinity 
penetrate, and he clearly recognizes the Being Who is without parts, 
indivisible, without magnitude, immeasurable; he finds God.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Is he 
investigating the wonders of the animal kingdom? He does so with an 
enthusiasm and a reverence that raise him above whatever may seem 
offensive or loathsome to the senses. In the formation, the design and 
the function of the least organ, he reads somewhat of the power and the 
beauty of Nature. Throughout the whole domain of animal life he finds 
no place for chance. Every organ has its purpose. From the 
contemplation of the fitness and harmony which he perceives in all 
parts of the animal kingdom, he ascends 
 <!--
132 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p132"></a>
 to the Divinity that determines their various functions.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> Be the 
subject of his studies what it may, it invariably ends in a hymn of 
praise to the Godhead. Surely, modern thinkers might well hesitate 
before censuring a religious attitude of mind constantly practised by 
the greatest intellect of antiquity. <p>

But the philosophy that the Church has sanctioned -- the philosophy of 
the Schools as expressed by their greatest and most representative 
genius, St. Thomas Aquinas -- is a far different system of philosophy 
from that enunciated by the Stagyrite. It accepts from him his methods, 
his definitions, his terms, whatever is conformable to the Divine 
teachings, and it supplements them with other truths and other 
conceptions of truth  more in consonance with the Divine mission of the 
Church. It is deeply rooted in the Early Fathers and in the decrees of 
the Councils. The outward form is Aristotelian, but the inner spirit is 
that of Christianity. It is this spirit that gives it life and power 
and extends its influence far beyond the domain of technical language. 
It is by reason of this spirit, that, to use the words of another, 
"Christian philosophy is the basis of our social existence; it 
nourishes the roots of our laws, and by it do we live far more than by 
ideas saved from the wreck of the Greek and Roman world."<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> The Church 
makes
 <!--
Conclusion. 133 
 --><A NAME="p133"></a>
 use of speculation only so far as it is essential to ground her 
doctrines and her practices in human reason. But it is not by means of 
speculation that she has renewed the face of the earth. It is rather by 
the seeds of Faith, which she has sown, and which have given forth a 
rich harvest of zeal, devotion, sanctity, and the edifying practice of 
every virtue. Philosophy is cold comfort under affliction, or want, or 
misery, or in the face of a great calamity. That which was best amongst 
the Stoics -- the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius -- was only a tonic 
bracing up the whole man to meet death or anticipate its coming by 
suicide. It taught the resignation of despair. That which is most 
probing among the moderns -- the philosophy of Schopenhauer -- finds 
nothing in life worth living for, and has consolation only for the man 
who is disgusted with living and resolved upon terminating his own 
career. It also teaches resignation, but it is likewise the resignation 
of despair. And Christianity inculcates resignation, but it is the 
resignation of love, and hope, and faith, awaiting the future, and 
knowing that all things are in the hands of a Divine Father. The one is 
the resignation of death; the other is a life-giving, active, hopeful, 
and saving resignation. Philosophy may speculate; Christianity acts. 
Speculation may console a few philosophers of leisure; but the soothing 
hand of Christian charity, nerved by the love of God and the love of 
man, and the consoling voice of religion, moved by the spirit 
 <!--
134 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p134"></a>
 of Faith, can alone revive expiring hopes, strengthen wavering 
resolutions for good, bring calm to the troubled mind, raise a soul out 
of despondency, and cause man to suffer and endure in a prayerful 
spirit all the pain that life may bring, knowing that in so doing he is 
best securing his individual perfection and sanctification, and best 
fulfilling the end for which he was created.  <p>
