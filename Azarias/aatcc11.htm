<h2>ARISTOTLE AND THE SCHOOLMEN IN METAPHYSICS AND  PSYCHOLOGY.</h2><p>

IN this comparative study we will confine ourselves chiefly to the 
writings of him who is the recognized exponent of the Schoolmen. The 
Church, through her Pontiffs, has, in no uncertain notes, proclaimed 
St. Thomas as her most zealous and enlightened champion. Leo XIII caps 
the climax of eulogy upon him when he says: "Rightly and deservedly is 
he reckoned a singular safeguard and glory of the Catholic Church. . . 
. Greatly enriched as he was with the science of God and the science of 
man, he is likened to the sun; for he warmed the whole earth with the 
fire of his holiness, and filled the whole earth with the splendour of 
his teaching."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> His pages even now throb with the glow of life, and the 
din of battle rings through his sentences. Some of the issues that he 
fought are things of the past and have for us no other interest than 
that belonging to every relic
 <!--
100 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p100"></a>
 preserved in the history of thought. For Thomas, however, they were 
living issues calling for a speedy solution. A large number has still 
for us a special interest. If we will only penetrate the dry and 
forbidding form of the syllogism in which the questions are put -- so 
put because the great <i>Summa Theologica</i> was intended to be a 
student's handbook -- we shall find that many of the old errors have 
survived under a new name. The same objections there made and the same 
refutations there given still hold good. A comparative study, 
therefore, of the essential doctrines of the Stagyrite and the 
Angelical Doctor cannot be without profit. <p>

We shall begin with Aristotle's conception of God. It is with a certain 
awe we read that magnificent chapter in his Metaphysics in which he 
demonstrates the existence of a Prime Mover and First Principle of all 
things. That a pagan philosopher, by the unaided light of reason, 
should acquire so clear a conception of the Godhead in Its unity and 
simplicity, is marvellous. Let us follow him for a moment: The eternal 
Something that imparts motion without being moved must be both 
Substance and Energy. This Immovable First Mover must be Entity; It 
must subsist after an excellent manner; It must be Necessary Being, and 
inasmuch as necessary, It must constitute the Good; It must therefore 
be the First Principle from which have depended Heaven and Nature. This 
Prime Mover must have Intelligence; 
 <!--
Aristotle and the Schoolmen in Metaphysics 101
 --><A NAME="p101"></a>
 but since intelligence is activity and activity is life, It must be 
Eternal Life; It must be Eternal Mind. Essential energy belongs to God 
as His Everlasting Life. With Him life and duration are uninterrupted 
and eternal; and this constitutes the very essence of God.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> It is all 
reasoned out with the neatest precision of his great intellect. It is 
one of the most golden pages in all antiquity. Well, after we shall 
have admired it to the full, let us enter the mind that evolved it. 
Nature is unveiled, and the philosopher stands face to face with the 
God of Nature. He has found Him as the answer to a problem. He touches 
him as the limit of a speculation. But God for Aristotle is not a 
Personal God with a loving care and interest in His creation. 
Elsewhere, in a chapter only less sublime than that we have been 
contemplating, he clearly asserts the unity and simplicity of God: "The 
Prime Mover is indivisible; is without parts; and has absolutely no 
kind of magnitude."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> This is clear, beautiful, and true. What 
Aristotle fails to see is the nature and operation of God as Cause. He 
fails to see that the highest act of causality is creation. He fails to 
see how the preservative act is a continuation of the causative act. He 
therefore misses all the consequences of these great truths. The God of 
Aristotle is not a God to Whom all rational beings are responsible  
 <!--
102 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p102"></a>
 for their every thought, word, and act. "Whatever the truth concerning 
Him might be," says Hampden, "it was not to be expressed in the 
uplifting of pure hearts and hands to Him. Though the whole world might 
be found His temple, He was not to be worshipped as the Holiness of 
their shrines. Though the heavens were telling of His glory, and the 
stars were singing together for joy at His presence, yet no praise was 
to ascend to Him, the Lord of heaven and earth, in the perfumes of 
their altars or the poetry and music of their hymns. Thus devotion, 
being banished from the heart, sought a refuge for itself in the 
wilderness of a speculative theological philosophy."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> The God of 
Aristotle is not the God of St. Thomas. The difference is marked. The 
God of St. Thomas is the God of Faith and Revelation, the God of the 
Nicene Creed, in substance One, in personality Three. <p>

Aristotle, in grasping the conception of God's simplicity, missed that 
of His personality. It enters as a fundamental principle into the 
philosophy of St. Thomas. The Saint accepts it as the Church presents 
it to him. The very definition of personality he takes as he finds  in 
a work attributed to Bo&euml;thius. There personality is defined as the 
individual substance of a rational nature.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> It is not the whole of the 
nature; it is simply something 
 <!--
Aristotle and the Schoolmen in Metaphysics. 103 
 --><A NAME="p103"></a>
 subsisting in the nature.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> Thus personality does not belong to the 
soul of man, nor does it belong to his body; but it belongs to that 
combination of body and soul that we call man. Neither is it something 
common to humanity as such; it can only be predicated of the particular 
man. Nor does it apply to other than rational natures. The personality 
of a dog or a horse has no meaning. Personality, then, is that which 
individualizes, completes, perfects the actuality of a rational nature. 
Inasmuch as God is an infinitely Intelligent Being, possessing all 
excellence, might reason apply to Him the conception of personality. He 
is most pure Actuality. His is therefore a Personal Nature. <p>

Here, once for all, let us rid ourselves of an erroneous notion. 
Personality does not in any sense imply limitation. As applied to man, 
the conception is finite, just as the conception of any other part or 
attribute of man is finite. Not so, as applied to God. His Personality 
is only the perfect realization of His Infinite Nature. But the perfect 
realization of an Infinite Nature has no limitation, except Its own 
Infinite Actuality. In this sense alone does personality apply to God. 
Thus far may reason go. But Thomas does not stop here. With fear and 
trembling,<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> he enters the
 <!--
104 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 -->
 sanctuary of revelation, and contemplates the threefold personality of 
God as it has been made known. The Father begets the Word from all 
eternity; from the mutual love of the Father and the Word proceeds the 
Holy Ghost. We shall see him draw many practical lessons from the 
contemplation of this sublime mystery. <p>

The Trinity is a subject fruitful in thought to him who would meditate 
upon it with reverence. The Three-in-One is all-perfect He is
 self-sufficing. He is free. He may or may not create. When He does 
extend His activity outside of Himself He does it of His own Will. He 
exercises the most perfect act of causality in creating all things out 
of nothing. He is Infinite Goodness. He is Infinite Love. Man falls. He 
respects the free-will of man to such an extent that He will not 
prevent man from falling. He sends His Son, the Word, the Second Person 
of the Blessed Trinity, to assume human nature and to redeem that 
nature from the degradation to which Original Sin had dragged it down. 
He holds communion with man; He reveals to man Sacred Truths of a 
higher order than those man learns from Nature; He stoops to raise man 
up, without violating any of His laws, but simply by bringing into play 
-- as in the case of miracles -- other laws above those that 
ordinarily govern the conditions of time and space in which man now 
lives. <p>

Note especially the great philosophic truth that is 
 <!--
Aristotle and the Schoolmen in Metaphysics. 105 
 --><A NAME="p105"></a>
 brought out by this Christian view of God and creation. On the one 
hand is the Infinite First Cause; on the other, is the finite effect. 
Now, do what we may, we can find no expression for the relation between 
the finite and the infinite. State them in their mathematical bareness, 
and we find their relation, or their ratio, running into infinity or 
nothingness. How bridge over the chasm? Finiteness can never touch the 
infinite. Be it so. The Infinite Being is free. The Infinite Being can 
reach finite things. And this the Infinite Being did in the Incarnation 
of the Word. The Divinity touches His creation with another act beside 
the creative act by which He drew it from nothingness; that Divine act 
bridges over the chasm; God unites Himself to that being among His 
creatures that combines in itself both spiritual and material elements, 
and thus raises up His whole creation to a plane worthy of His creative 
and preservative power. Has it ever occurred to us what may be the 
infinite suggestiveness of this great truth in philosophical 
speculation? There is much in it for head and for heart. We have ample 
evidence of its life-giving force in the regenerating work of 
Christianity; but have we measured its power as an element in 
philosophy? You may say that the truth is a mystery -- is of revelation 
-- and as such has no place in philosophy. But are religious mysteries 
the only mysteries? Has philosophy none? Can 
 <!--
106 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p106"></a>
 philosophy explain the phenomena of thought, or of growth, or of 
organism, or of life, without landing in mystery? There are dark lines 
running all along the spectrum of our knowledge; for how few of them 
can we really account? Then, why not let in the light of revelation? <p>

Aristotle missed the idea of creation. The Church presents it to the 
Christian philosopher as an article of faith. The Christian philosopher 
believes that in the beginning God created all things from nothing, of 
His own free Will, and out of His own pure Goodness. God spoke, and 
they were. All things are created by the Word, and according to the 
Divine exemplars existing in the Word. In this beautiful manner does 
the doctrine of the Trinity enter into the creative act. St. Thomas 
goes to show that it cannot be demonstrated that the world existed 
throughout all eternity.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> God alone is eternal Albert the Great grows 
impatient of those who ask what God was doing prior to creation. "In 
eternity," he says, "there is neither soon nor late, long nor short, 
space nor time . . . . The eternity of God is an indivisible 
present."<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> Neither, according to the Angelical Doctor, can we prove 
the creation of all things from nothingness.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> It is a mystery if you 
will; but it
 <!--
Aristotle and the Schoolmen in Psychology. 107 
 --><A NAME="p107"></a>
 is one willingly accepted. Indeed, it is far less a mystery than to 
admit that matter is not infinite and is yet eternal. At every point in 
which the finite touches the infinite there is a mystery; let him 
explain who can.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> Thus it is that on God and His Providence, His 
personality, and His attributes, on creation and preservation, and the 
long chain of consequences that flow from these truths, do we find 
Christian philosophy standing upon a plane distinct from that on which 
the Lyceum stood. <p>

Again, we take Aristotle's treatise on the human soul. The close 
argument, the clearness and simplicity of language, the terseness and 
homeliness of phrase and illustration -- all carry us along a train of 
reasoning that opens up to us new avenues of thought. The union of soul 
and body, their unity and interdependence, are discussed and made to 
flow from those primary principles that run through all his philosophy. 
Substance may be viewed as matter; or it may be viewed as form; or it 
may be viewed as a combination of both matter and form.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> While matter 
is in itself and by itself mere potential existence, the form gives it 
actuality.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> Now, there is a principle of life in all organic bodies. 
But life is the process of nutrition, increase and decay going on under 
the activity of this principle. This principle is the soul.
 <!--
108 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p108"></a>
 Soul we may therefore define as the formative principle of a body 
having predisposition to life.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> The definition is admirable. The clear 
and rigid reasoning by which the philosopher reached it, is admirable. 
The Schoolmen accept it; they cannot improve upon it; they simply put 
it into a more condensed formula. They define the soul as the form of 
the body. But the soul as Aristotle conceived it, is not the soul as 
conceived by the Schoolmen. The soul, in the conception of the 
Stagyrite, is somewhat more than a vital principle, such as belongs to. 
plant and animal; but it is also perishable and becomes annihilated 
when the animal organism is destroyed.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> The soul in the conception of 
the Schoolmen is a spiritual substance animating a material body, 
imperishable, undying, immortal. Above the soul, distinct and separable 
from it, Divine in its origin and eternal in its nature, an everlasting 
existence incapable of being mingled with matter,<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> Aristotle places the 
creative reason, and thus, as we have seen, lays the foundation for the 
universal intellect of the Averroists. But the Schoolmen made no such 
distinction. All in the human intellect is included in the soul. And 
the Church endorsed their doctrine, when in the Council of Vienne, in 
1311, she condemned the opinion 
 <!--
Aristotle and the Schoolmen in Psychology. 109 
 --><A NAME="p109"></a>
 that the intellectual soul was not the substantial form of the 
body.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

Recognizing with Aristotle the intimate union and interdependence of 
soul and body, the Schoolmen accepted the principle of Aristotle that 
there is nothing in the intellect which is not first in the senses.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> 
But rejecting his doctrine of a creative reason distinct and separable 
from the soul, they sought elsewhere the explanation of that phenomenon 
by which the soul separates universals from particulars, and apprehends 
them, and reasons upon them. They went to the fountain-head. They also 
admitted a principle above and beyond human reason; but they recognized 
it to be the Divine Light, proceeding from the Word and illumining 
every man coming into this world.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> From the Word proceeds that light 
by which our intellect thinks and reasons. "That intellectual light 
which is within us," says the Angel of the Schools, "is naught else 
than a certain participated likeness of the uncreated light in which 
are contained the eternal reasons."<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> And our intellect knows and 
apprehends truth only in the light of these eternal reasons.  
 <!--
110 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p110"></a>
 Thus is it that St. Thomas connects the active intellect<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> of the 
soul with the Supreme Intelligence; thus does he explain that 
marvellous power by which the human intellect separates the universal 
from the singular and makes it the object of thought.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

Throughout the theory of knowing developed by St. Thomas there runs a 
golden chain connecting all knowledge with God. He defines truth with 
Isaac<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> as the equation of the thing with the intellect. But this 
equation results from a twofold conformity: first, truth is in the 
intellect according as it is conformed to its principle, namely, the 
thing from which the intellect receives its cognition; and second, 
truth is in the thing according as there is conformity between itself 
and its principle, which is the Divine Intellect.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> Thus does St. 
Thomas place all truth between the Divine Mind and the human 
understanding, the latter receiving its sanction and its certitude from 
the former. And in this elevated sphere of thought, taking in the whole 
scale, does he, in a sublime manner, distinguish between the different 
orders of intelligences according to their mode of apprehending truth. 
God is the Prime Intelligence, knowing all things in the light of His 
own Divine
 <!--
Aristotle and the Schoolmen in Psychology. 111
 --><A NAME="p111"></a>
 Essence. Therein has He the plenitude of all cognitions. Now the 
nearer and the liker created intelligences are to God, the more they 
resemble Him in the mode of their knowing. And since He knows all 
things in the light of His Essence, which is One, the higher the scale 
of intelligence, the fewer is the number of ideas by means of which 
that intelligence knows. Thus, the superior angels have, because of 
their greater proximity to God, in the light of fewer ideas, a more 
perfect knowledge than have the inferior; and these latter have greater 
knowledge in a simpler conception and by means of less ideas, than have 
human intelligences. And so, among men, the more superior the 
intelligence, the greater the grasp of thought, and also the less the 
number of ideas.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> Thus it is that the genius has chiefly a single idea 
in the light of which he resolves and explains all other ideas. Here is 
a doctrine with suggestiveness enough for a volume of thought. In this 
manner does St. Thomas construct a theory of knowing undreamed of by 
Aristotle. Turn we now to their relative treatment of the question of 
morals.<p>
