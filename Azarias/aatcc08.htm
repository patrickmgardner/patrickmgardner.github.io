<h1>VIII.</h1>
<h2>ARISTOTLE IN THE UNIVERSITY.</h2><p>

We know not to what extent the restored books were corrected. The 
strictures of the commission cannot have been very severe, since we 
find the most objectionable passages in the condemned books paraphrased 
by Albertus Magnus (1193-1280). "Our censors," says Haur&eacute;au, 
"would undoubtedly have marked these passages, but without cutting them 
out; later on the remembrance of those prudent notes being lost, there 
would be found persons bold enough, not only to expound, but even to 
justify the whole of the Physics."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Roger Bacon fixes the date of 
1237 as that prior to which all censure ceased to attach to the reading 
of the prohibited books.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Whatever the corrections may have been, 
they were soon swept away by the spirit of rationalism. No temporary 
torrent it, as Philip de G&rgrave;eve would have us regard its influx. 
More and more does it gain
 <!--
Aristotle in the University. 67 
 --><A NAME="p67"></a>
 ground, and greater and greater is the havoc that it plays among young 
and old in the University. Religious studies have grown distasteful. 
Eudes, another Chancellor, sums up the statement of affairs at this 
period when he complains that the men of his day spend their whole time 
in the pursuit of secular knowledge and seem to care nothing for the 
science of God.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> Roger Bacon bears witness to the continuous 
influence of Avicenna and Averro&euml;s in the schools.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> In 1240, we 
find the Bishop of Paris condemning ten specific errors, all of them 
Arabo-Peripatetic in their nature.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> In 1247, Eudes, now Papal Legate, 
publicly condemns two professors, John Brescian and Raimund; 
furthermore, he insists that logicians shall confine themselves to 
their own subjects and shall not meddle with questions of theology.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> 
In the mean time, Aristotle's influence grows apace. A knowledge of his 
philosophy becomes indispensable. The University extends the course of 
studies so as to include nearly all his works then known. Thus, it 
inscribes upon the statute-books the following, upon which the student 
will be required to  
 <!--
68 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p68"></a>
 pass examinations : -- The Dialectics, the Topics, the Ethics, the 
Physics, the Metaphysics and the Natural History; the book on the 
Heavens; that on Meteors and that on Generation; the spurious book on 
Causality; the books on Sensation, on Sleep and Waking, on Plants, on 
the Distinction of Spirit and Soul, on Memory, and on Life and 
Death.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> May we not say that Aristotle has monopolized the whole 
course of study? That which is his, and that which is not his, but 
which simply bears his name, are read without discrimination. Error 
must needs grow out of such uncritical reading. The Church continues to 
exercise all due vigilance. Alexander IV. invites Albert the Great to 
refute the errors that are rife.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Again, it is found necessary to 
expurge  
 <!--
Aristotle in the University. 69 
 --><A NAME="p69"></a>
 the Physics and the Metaphysics. Neither master nor student seems 
desirous to discriminate between the doctrine that is conformable and 
the doctrine that is opposed to the teachings of revealed religion. 
Indeed, a fundamental proposition, held by many of that day was that a 
statement may be true in philosophy and yet contrary to Faith, or true 
according to Faith and false according to reason. It is an old error 
which the Church has had to contend with from the beginning. It is the 
last subterfuge of a soul believing and yet carried away by 
intellectual inflation. And it is in order to remove this
 stumbling-block from such souls that Urban IV., in a Bull to the 
University, forbids any further reading of the Physics and Metaphysics 
until they shall have been freed from all the doctrines contrary to the 
Faith.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> Here, too, has it been asserted that this prohibition of Urban 
was the outcome of the continuous opposition of Rome to Aristotle; 
here, too, have those making the charge been mistaken. The quarrel is 
not between Rome and Aristotle; it is between the Church and the 
irresponsible rationalism of the day. No greater patron  
 <!--
70 Aristotle and the Christiau Church. 
 --><A NAME="p70"></a>
 of learning was there than Pope Urban IV. And in an especial manner 
was he a patron of philosophy. "To Urban IV.," says Tiraboschi, "is 
due, by all right and title, the glory of having revived philosophy in 
Italy."<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> One year previous to the issuing of this Bull, in 1261, Urban 
called to Rome the Angelical Doctor, and had him to comment upon the 
very works, the reading of which for the time being he was prohibiting 
in Paris. "About this time," says the historian, "Brother Thomas did 
and wrote much at the request of Urban. . . . Professing in Rome, he 
gathered together nearly the whole of philosophy, both natural and 
moral, and wrote commentaries thereon; but chiefly upon the Ethics and 
the Metaphysics, which he treated in a novel and peculiar manner."<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup>
Urban appreciates Aristotle, but he prizes still more the souls of the 
youths of Paris who are led astray from the teachings of the Church by 
false doctrines imposed upon them in the name of Aristotle. For him to 
act otherwise would be a betrayal of his trust  
 <!--
Aristotle in the University. 71 
 --><A NAME="p71"></a>
 as guardian of the faith and morals of Christendom. Hence his action 
in reviving the prohibition of Gregory. But for all that, the spirit of 
rationalism is not checked. Indeed, every effort made to check it, 
seems to cause it to become more rampant. Stephen Tempier, the Bishop 
of Paris) in 1268, sounds the alarm. He assembles the Church and 
University authorities. They discuss and condemn some of the leading 
errors afloat. Among them are many long known to the student of 
philosophy: that the intellect of all men is numerically one and 
identical; that the world is eternal; that the human will wishes and 
chooses by necessity. The assembly admonishes the Rectors and Proctors 
of the diverse faculties that things pertaining to Faith be not 
discussed in schools of philosophy, lest weak minds, in attempting to 
grasp its inscrutable mysteries should be led to disbelieve or doubt 
them altogether.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> And not alone obscure and reckless men held and 
taught the condemned propositions; they were publicly broached and 
discussed by masters of the highest reputation.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> The ablest men in 
the Church are called upon to cope with them, and to protect the 
teachings of Christian philosophy against the encroachment of 
rationalism. Brother Gilles of the Dominican Order begs Albert the 
Great to write a 
 <!--
72 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p72"></a>
 refutation of the condemned propositions. Albert, though arrived at 
that period in life when men who have borne the heat and the burden of 
the day seek repose, took his pen and wrote a vigorous tract against 
them.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> Aquinas is recalled to Paris to resume his lessons. He also 
writes an unsparing refutation of the errors afloat.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> The University 
makes it matter of expulsion for any professor of philosophy to broach 
in public any theological question, if within a given time after 
receiving warning he recall not what he has said. Also, if in public 
disputations, he should decide any question against what is of Faith, 
he shall be expelled unless he makes public retraction and 
reparation.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> The struggle grows more intense. The University forbids 
public discussion of Averroistic doctrines; they become a general topic 
of private discussion and private tuition. Banished from the chairs, 
they are whispered in corners and in closets. St. Thomas alludes to 
this subterfuge in his tract against them: "All that we have written 
against this error," says he -- he is alluding to the error of the 
unity of the human intellect -- "is not from the evidences of Faith, 
but from the sayings and reasonings of philosophers themselves. Still, 
should some author, inflated with pride through false science, desire 
to refute what we 
 <!--
Aristotle in the University. 73 
 --><A NAME="p73"></a>
 have advanced, let him not speak in corners, nor before boys incapable 
of pronouncing upon such arduous questions; but if he dares, let him 
refute our writing. He will then find, not only in me who am least of 
all, but in many others as well, those who are sustainers of the truth, 
and by whom his errors will be refuted and his ignorance 
reclaimed."<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> The University, in consequence, raises its voice 
against the teaching of theology and philosophy in private, and 
everywhere outside of the regularly appointed chairs.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> <p>

Through all this strife with rationalism, perhaps all the better 
because of the strife, have the Schoolmen, to all intents and purposes, 
completed their work. Thomas is dead, and Bonaventura is dead, and 
Albert is fast approaching the close of his long and wonderful career. 
But the rationalistic influx grows broader and deeper. The condemned 
errors are no longer counted by the tens; they are counted by the 
hundreds.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> They extend to Oxford, and it is found needful that the 
same syllabus of them be there introduced.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> All Europe seems flooded  
with the doctrines that flow from the Eternal Gospel,  
 <!--
74 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p74"></a>
 from Amaury, from David of Dinant, from Averro&euml; s. These are the 
tares of the teeming intellectual activity that the thirteenth century 
produced. Women become infected with the new doctrines and believe 
themselves heaven sent. The Beguin Wilhelmina, of Milan, represents 
herself as the Holy Ghost, and miracles are said to have been worked at 
her tomb.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> An Englishwoman, beautiful and eloquent, passes through 
Italy, teaching that the Holy Ghost has become incarnate in her for the 
redemption of woman.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> These are only a few of the many wild vagaries 
that thrived, directly or indirectly, under the shadow of
 Arabo-Aristotelian teachings. <p>

Lastly, now that in the vast storehouses of an Albert and a Thomas -- 
not to mention an Alexander of Hales, a Bonaventura, and others only a 
little less renowned -- are to be found the method and the principles of 
refutation of all possible objections that can be raised in the name of 
Aristotle; now that it has been proved that if adversaries of the Faith 
find in him weapons of attack, its defenders find also in him no less 
effective weapons of resistance, the Church pays his genius a crowning 
honour. She herself installs him in the University. In 1366, two 
Cardinal Legates from Pope Urban V., deputed to reform the University 
in all its faculties, make obligatory upon all aspiring to the 
Bachelor's Degree the  
 <!--
Aristotle in the University. 75 
 --><A NAME="p75"></a>
 study of the Logic and Psychology of Aristotle. Nor can any one 
receive his Master's Degree, who has not read the Physics, the 
Metaphysics, the Ethics and the minor works of the Stagyrite.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup>
"Henceforth," says Haur&eacute;au, after noticing this event, 
"Aristotle shall be the universal teacher."<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> Yes, in a certain sense. 
We shall determine that sense by inquiring into the spirit in which the 
great minds among the Schoolmen accepted Aristotle as Master. Were they 
mere formalists repeating or imitating the Philosopher? The accusation 
has been made and the impression remains. With what justice we shall 
see.  <p>

<a name="n_7"><a href="#n7">{7}</a></a> It is interesting to note the distribution of those varied 
subjects. After mentioning the Dialectics, Topics, and Ethics, the 
statute continues "Physicam Aristotelis, Metaphysicam et librum de

his Exposition of the Gospel of St. 
John "ad instantiam Alexandri IV., pro extirpandis haeresibus tunc 
vigentibus Romae lecta." Again, after refuting the pantheistic doctrine 
of a universal intellect actuating all minds, he says: Haec omnia 
aliquando collegi in curia existens ad praeceptum Domini Alexandri 
Papae, et factos fuit inde libellus quem multi habent et intitulatur
