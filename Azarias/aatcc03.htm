<h1>III.</h1>
<h2>ARISTOTLE AND HIS INFLUENCE.</h2><p>

ARISTOTLE will now enter upon a career of conquest and influence far 
exceeding the conquest and the influence of his great pupil, Alexander. 
Let us pause a moment at the threshold of his power. Schools and 
systems rise and flourish and become a thing of history; but centuries, 
now of neglect, now of undue admiration, having elapsed, Aristotle 
blooms into perennial freshness long after those who admired or 
condemned him have passed into oblivion. Certainly, the secret of this 
influence lies not in elegance of style, nor in glow of expression, 
nor, as we now possess him, in harmony of arrangement. His language is 
at this day sometimes obscure, sometimes almost unintelligible, 
generally severe; with much weariness of spirit is he read, but also 
with none the less avidity.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> "The half-understood words of 
 <!--
14 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p14"></a>
 Aristotle have become laws of thought to other ages."<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Even when he 
was handed down in imperfect translation and was but ill-understood, 
his genius, though clouded, remained not without recognition. He was 
called the Prince of Philosophers;<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> the Master of them that know;<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> 
the limit and paragon of human intelligence.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> Among the lesser 
intellectual lights, veneration for him became a superstition, and no 
word of his would they dream of disputing. Such over-estimation led to 
reaction. The pious regarded him as the root of all heresy.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> The 
Humanists found the polished pages of Plato more congenial, and 
accordingly upon Plato expended all their enthusiasm. The Reformers 
found him too identified with Catholic dogma to subserve their 
purposes. We know what Luther thought of him "If Aristotle had not been 
of flesh, I should not hesitate to affirm him to have been truly a 
devil."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Both Bacon and Descartes, each after his own manner, 
directed their whole energies towards the overthrow of the Stagyrite in 
order to prepare the way for their respective systems. The philosophers 
of the eighteenth century neither under<!--
Aristotle and his Influence. 15 
 --><A NAME="p15"></a>stood nor appreciated him.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Diderot calls his philosophy one of 
the greatest plagues of the human intellect.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> The nineteenth century 
is more just. After having tested many systems of philosophy -- after 
Kant and Hegel and Schopenhauer and Cousin and Mill and Herbert Spencer 
have spoken -- we find the current of thought drifting back once more 
towards Aristotle. And we are returning with many advantages over his 
early admirers. We have purer texts. The history of philosophy is 
better known, and throws light upon many points hitherto but 
imperfectly understood. The spirit of study at the present day is 
thoughtful and many-sided. It ignores no element. It recognizes no 
break. It finds opinions of the present intimately related to ideas in 
the remotest past. It accepts as a primary principle that in the world 
of ideas, as in that of society, thoughts are generated, grow, and 
develop according to laws as rigid as those governing the generation 
and development of the human body. It postulates as an elementary 
condition of right-knowing, that in order to apprehend any subject 
properly, one must search and consider the contributions that have been 
made to that subject in the past, and, if possible, lay finger upon the 
germs of the thoughts that are now full-blown. The spirit of study 
pursued in  
 <!--
16 Aristotle and Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p16"></a>
 conformity with these principles, must needs appreciate the importance 
of an intellect that during twenty-odd centuries has been moulding the 
forms of thought and constructing the grooves in which the trained 
intellects of civilized Europe should reason. <p>

The genius of Aristotle stands out in strong contrast with that of his 
great master, Plato. His frame of mind was in many respects 
diametrically opposite. He lacked the religious fervour of his master. 
He was emphatically a man of the world, whereas Plato was a recluse. He 
was wanting in that reverence for antiquity and all belonging to it -- 
the old myths, the old cosmogonies, the old traditions -- that lend 
such a charm to the pages of Plato; and if he does speak of his 
predecessors, and accept what they handed down, with a certain modesty, 
it is simply the modesty belonging to every close student who knows 
his own limitations. Plato was governed by an enthusiasm that lit up 
his soul and revealed to him the highest and noblest regions of ideal 
thought and emotion; Aristotle looked at the cold facts of the case, 
dissected every element of thought and expression with the coolness of 
the surgeon handling the scalpel, and set down his observations in the 
dryest and baldest manner. <p>

What were the personal feelings of the Stagyrite towards his great 
teacher? Were they friendly, or were they antagonistic? We know not. We 
can only surmise. But, whether Aristotle gave the sense of Plato as he 
 <!--
Aristotle and his Influence. 17 
 --><A NAME="p17"></a>
 understood that sense; whether he concealed the true meaning of his 
master's teaching and gave only the literal external rendering thereof; 
or whether he deliberately, and with malice aforethought, changed and 
distorted his master's doctrines; or whether, still, he merely took the 
imperfect expression of them as given by disciples unable to grasp 
their whole bearing, and answered these with a view simply of making 
them so many pegs on which to hang his own doctrines: be the 
explanation what it may, the real position of Aristotle's philosophy  
in the history of thought is that it stands out from the philosophy of 
Plato, not as a mere contradiction to that philosophy, but as 
completing and perfecting it, and supplying its shortcomings. He laid 
hold of the laws of thought and made of them a science. He separated 
philosophy from fable and myth and metaphor, and gave it a method and a 
scientific terminology.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> He developed the syllogism to a degree of 
perfection that has left it the admiration of all succeeding thinkers. 
He taught after-ages how to classify and how to define with accuracy 
and with method. More than this has he done; but this much suffices to 
establish his claim upon the appreciation of men for all time. <p>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a></a> Cicero studied Aristotle in Athens, in the very atmosphere of his 
writings, and surrounded by all the traditions of the Lyceum, and yet 
he found the study of him difficult: "Magna animi contentio adhibenda 
est in explicando Aristotele" (Frag. Hortensius). See J. B. Saint 
Hilaire, <i>Met. d'Arist.</i>, tom. i., Pref., p. ii. <p>
