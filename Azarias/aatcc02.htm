<h1>II.</h1>
<h2>THE CHURCH AND HER APOLOGISTS.</h2><p>

THIS attitude of calm reserve in regard to all systems and schools, the 
Church maintains during the long years that she is establishing and 
confirming her dominion throughout the world. Her great Apologists 
defend her, and attempt to show forth the sublimity of her teachings. 
When they speak well, she approves and blesses; when they say aught 
contrary to the truths of which she is the faithful custodian, she 
condemns. Justin Martyr (d. 166) is a philosopher of the School of 
Plato. The sublime doctrines which he imbibed in that School lead him 
to the threshold of the Church.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Grace does the rest, and Justin 
Martyr becomes one of the most eloquent defenders and expounders of 
the truths of Christianity.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> He seals with his blood the conviction 
that he indites with his pen. He seeks to reconcile the truths of Faith 
with the highest and noblest truths of philosophy. Throughout his 
discourses there runs the postulate 
 <!--
8 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p8"></a>
 which the Church ever insists upon, that between the dogmas of Faith 
and the conclusions of reason there can be no contradiction.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> He 
tells us that among all men are to be found seeds of truth;<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> that 
whatever things were spoken with truth are the property of the 
Christian;<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> that Christian truth is fuller and more Divine than that 
which has been handed down by sage and poet.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> Athenagoras had a noble 
conception both of philosophy and religion, and eloquently did he 
attempt their reconciliation; but if he relies mainly upon Plato in his 
plea for Christians,<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> in his proofs for the resurrection of the body, 
he is more a disciple of Aristotle.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Tertullian (165-268) seems to 
hold Plato and Aristotle in equal abhorrence. "Thanks," he says, "to 
this simplicity of truth so opposed to the subtlety and vain deceit of 
philosophy, we cannot possibly have any relish for such perverse 
opinions."<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> But Tertullian did not escape the censure of the Church
 <!--
The Church and her Apologists. 9 
 --><A NAME="p9"></a>
 when, in the rashness of his bold and brilliant intellect, he broached 
doctrines opposed to those in her keeping. It is always dangerous to 
despise and antagonize aught of good in any of God's creatures. <p>

In a more conciliatory spirit laboured the great philosophers of the 
Christian Schools of Alexandria. Clement and Origen -- both of them 
great in genius, great in piety, great in the depth and eloquence of 
their writings -- gather into a single focus the rays of truth that they 
find in all systems, whether of the East or of the West, and attempt a 
Christian encyclopaedia of philosophy and theology, worthy of the Church 
they would defend and of the noble truths they would explain. Nothing 
comes amiss to Clement. He sifts, examines, chooses whatever he lays 
hands upon; whatever he finds good therein he makes his own. "I call 
him truly learned," he says, "who brings everything to bear on the 
truth; so that from geometry, and music, and grammar, and philosophy 
itself, culling what is useful, he guard the Faith against assault. Now, 
as was said, the athlete is despised who is not furnished for the 
contest."<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> In this truly eclectic spirit did Clement work. In this 
truth-loving and truth-searching spirit also did Origen work. He tells 
us that the Apostles on many points were content with saying that 
things are; why they are, or how they are, they abstained from making 
known; leaving to studious men 
 <!--
10 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><A NAME="p10"></a>
 and lovers of Wisdom to investigate these things, clearly in order 
that those of them most worthy might have a subject of exercise on 
which to display the fruit of their talents.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> In so acting the 
Apostles were carrying out the spirit of the Church. <p>

Later on, when controversy raged fiercely upon the doctrine of the 
Trinity, the Church raised her voice, and in the Council of Nicaea, A.D. 
325, defined that doctrine in terms clear and simple. Forthwith the
 co-eternity, equality, and consubstantiality of the Father, Son, and 
Holy Ghost, became a life-giving truth that saved Christendom from the 
blight of the cold monotheism of Mohamed, or the decayed polytheism of 
Paganism. This great truth held up for contemplation the Father 
illuminating humanity by His Word, and sanctifying it by His Holy 
Spirit. <i>"We believe in one God the Father Almighty, Maker of all 
things visible and invisible, and in one Lord Jesus Christ the Son of 
God . . . begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father, through 
Whom all things came into being, both the things in heaven and the 
things in earth; Who for us men and for our salvation came down and was 
made flesh . . . and in the Holy Ghost."</i><sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> Such are its leading 
terms. It is only the defining of a religious dogma; but that 
definition becomes a landmark upon the road of intellectual progress. 
In 
 <!--
The church and her Apologists. 11 
 --><A NAME="p11"></a>
 the few simple words of the Nicene creed -- steering clear of Gnostic 
reveries and Platonic dreams, of barren monadism and confusing 
polytheism -- we find summed up more than philosophy could invent or 
imagine concerning the nature of the Godhead. It was the answer of the 
Church to the attempt of the Neo-Platonists to crush her and set up 
against her teachings a strange jargon of all systems and all 
religions. And upon this solid basis was it that St. Augustine nobly 
refuted their errors, whilst admitting whatever was good in their 
system.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Inimical as Neo-Platonism was to the Church, the children of the Church 
took from its teachings whatever they considered good or useful for the 
clearing up of her doctrines. Thus, the writings of the pseudo-Dionysius, 
possessing much that is true and beautiful, abound in opinions that 
read like pages extracted from Plotinus and Proclus.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> St. Maximus
 (580-662) prizes them highly, and makes of them a careful paraphrase. 
John of Damascus invokes their authority. Irish monks fostered the 
Neo-Platonic philosophy in the West. They were at this time the only 
Hellenists of Europe, and their Hellenism was that of Alexandria. 
Whence Alcuin calls Clement the Hibernian and his associates Egyptians. 
"In going away," he writes to Charlemagne from his monastery in Tours, 
"I had left Latins 
 <!--<p>

12 Aristotle and the Christian Church. 
 --><a name="p12"></a>
 about you; I know not who has replaced them by Egyptians."<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> Through 
the Greek studies of these monks were the Neo-Platonic traditions 
handed down. They were Alexandrians in philosophy as well as in 
mathematics. Finally, Scotus Erigena, a brilliant scholar, the ornament 
of the Court of Charles the Bald, teaches school in Greek,<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> 
translates the works of the pseudo-Dionysius into Latin, and 
disseminates the philosophy of Proclus.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> Aquinas clinches many an 
argument with weapons drawn from the Dionysian writings. Later on, in 
the reaction against the disputations of the Schools, we find a 
Mysticism, based upon their teachings, spread far and wide; and, under 
the guidance of Tauler, Henry Suso, and the Society of Friends of God, 
influence whole sections and peoples. It is also through a disciple of 
Neo-Platonism that Aristotle begins his sway in the West. Boethius 
(470-526) makes his studies in Athens. He brings back with him, 
among other works, parts of the Aristotelian Logic, with the 
Introduction of Porphyry. These he gives to the students of the West 
in elegant translation. <p>
