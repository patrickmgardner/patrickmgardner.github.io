<h2>Introduction.</h2><p>

<a name="p1"/>1. <b>Moral Philosophy</b> is the science of the moral order, or of the right and wrong of human acts. It is called <i>Ethics</i> from the Greek word <b>&ecirc;th&ecirc;</b> which, like the Latin word <i>mores,</i> signifies morals. Since its object is not merely speculative knowledge, but the true direction of human acts, <i>Ethics</i> is also styled <i>Practical Philosophy</i>.<p>

<a name="p2"/>2. Ethics, we say, directs human acts. However, not all the acts of a man are called <i>human acts,</i> but only such as are under the control of his free will. Whatever he does necessarily -- <i>i. e.,</i> whatever he cannot help doing -- results from the physical laws of nature, and, as such, is willed and directed by the Author of nature. For instance, a man may fall like a stone, or grow like a plant, or perceive a sound like a brute animal, without any power on his part to prevent himself from falling or growing or hearing, if the required conditions are present. These are <i>acts of the man,</i> but they are not acts of what is distinctively human -- namely, his intellect and his will. The term <i>human act</i> is restricted in philosophy to those acts which a man does knowingly and willingly -- which he has the power either to do or not to do.<p>

<a name="p3"/>3. To be qualified for the direction of human acts, Philosophy must derive its conclusions by reasoning from first principles; it must take into account the nature of man, and The natures of all the causes that influence human action.

Much of this we have considered in <i>Metaphysics, or Mental Philosophy</i>. Ethics is thus founded on Metaphysics: Moral Philosophy assumes as its principles the conclusions established in Mental Philosophy.<p>

<a name="p4"/>4. To explain the object of Moral Philosophy, which we have declared to be the true direction of human acts, we shall treat in Book I. <i>of the direction of human acts in general;</i> in Book II., <i>of the special duties and rights of men viewed as individuals;</i> and, in Book III., <i>of the rights and duties of men viewed as members of society</i>.
