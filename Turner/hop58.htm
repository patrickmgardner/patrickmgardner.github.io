BRITISH MORALISTS<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

The group of distinguished moralists who flourished in Great Britain 
during the eighteenth century may be said to represent the ethical 
phase of the empirical movement of that age. In 
 <!--
496 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p496"></a>
 determining moral values, mediaeval ethics had subordinated worldly 
interests to the interests of the future life. Hobbes, by his doctrine 
of state absolutism, had subjugated the moral to the political aspect 
of human conduct. Locke, however, admitted self-interest and the good 
of the many as moral determinants, and thus enabled his contemporaries 
and successors to develop a system of morality which should be 
<i>independent of religion as well as of state authority</i>, and 
should rest ultimately on the ego.<p>

Towards the end of the seventeenth century, <b>Ralph Cudworth</b> 
(1617-1688), in his <i>Treatise concerning Eternal and Immutable 
Morality</i>, expounded a system of morals which, although rational 
rather than empirical, prepared the way for the advocates of 
independent morality who appeared in the following century. He taught 
that moral principles and ethical ideals come neither from the will of 
God, nor from political authority, nor from experience, but from the 
ideas which necessarily exist in the mind of God and are universally 
and immutably present in the human mind. He agreed with the schoolmen 
in maintaining the universality and immutability of the natural law, 
but differed from them in teaching that it is absolutely <i>a 
priori</i>.<p>

<b>Shaftesbury</b> (1671-1713). Anthony Ashley Cooper Shaftesbury, the 
grandson of Locke's patron, and the author of <i>Characteristicks of 
Men, Manners, Opinions, and Times</i>, points out the consequences that 
follow from Locke's rejection of innate principles of morality, but 
instead of basing the morality of actions on innate principles he bases 
it on innate sentiment. For an innate logic of conduct he substitutes 
an innate aesthetic. His <i>concept of the universe</i> as a whole is 
<i>aesthetic</i> rather than <i>logical</i>: he conceives the
 all-pervading law of creation to be unity in variety. The parts of the 
bodily organism are governed and held together by the soul, and thus 
arises the unity in diversity which is the ego. But the ego is not 
complete in itself, for individuals are joined together into species 
and genera by unities higher than the individual soul, and above all 
species 
 <!--
BRITISH MORALISTS 497
 --><A NAME="p497"></a>
 and all genera is the mind of the Deity, which, by uniting the 
diversities of genera and species makes the world a cosmos, a beautiful 
thing.<p>

The individual is, therefore, swayed in one direction by the impulse of 
self-preservation, and in another direction by the impulse to preserve 
the higher unity (species) to which it belongs; that individual is good 
in which the latter impulse is strong and the former not too 
strong.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Applying these principles to man, Shaftesbury defines the <i>essence of 
morality</i> as consisting in the <i>proper balancing of the social and 
selfish impulses</i>. There is no morality in "sensible creatures," 
because, although they may balance the impulse for the preservation of 
self with the interests of the species, they are incapable of 
reflecting on the nature of their impulses, or of perceiving the 
harmony which results when the social and the selfish impulses are 
properly balanced. Man, on the contrary, is endowed with the power of 
reflection and of perceiving and approving the harmony which results 
from the proper balancing of his propensities. The faculty of moral 
distinction is not, therefore, a rational faculty but an <i>aesthetic 
sense</i>, -- the power of perceiving harmony and beauty.<p>

As the harmony of impulses constitutes <i>virtue</i>, so also it 
constitutes <i>happiness</i>. Virtue is its own reward. Religion is an 
aid to virtue inasmuch as it teaches that the world is ruled by an
 all-loving and all-protecting God, thus confirming the aesthetic 
concept of the universe as a harmony. Positive religion, however, is a 
hindrance to virtue in so far as it promises heavenly rewards, thus 
making men mercenary and selfish.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Bernard Mandeville</b> (1670-1733) revealed, by his advocacy of a 
startling paradox, the weakness of Shaftesbury's system of morals, the 
danger namely of attaching to noble impulses so much importance as to 
neglect the cultivation of useful though commonplace virtues. In <i>The 
Fable of the Bees</i> he advocates the novel 
 <!--
498 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p498"></a>
 doctrine that <i>private vices are public benefits</i>. He attempts to 
show that just as in the hive contentment and honesty cannot go hand in 
hand with splendor and prosperity, so in the community of social life 
it is the selfish impulses -- the desire of food and drink, ambition, 
envy, and impatience (which Shaftesbury would have us balance against 
the social instincts) -- that lead to labor, civilization, and the 
social life. We must choose between <i>moral progress</i> and 
<i>material progress</i>, for we cannot have both.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In spite of the opposition which it provoked at the time, Shaftesbury's 
doctrine of moral aestheticism continued to win adherents, and the 
remaining moral systems of the period, those of <i>Hutcheson, 
Butler</i>, and <i>Adam Smith</i>, are simply the logical development 
of Shaftesbury's teachings.<p>

<b>Francis Hutcheson</b> (1694-1746) was born in Ireland and, after 
teaching in a private academy in Dublin, was appointed professor of 
moral philosophy at Glasgow. He wrote an <i>Inquiry into the Original 
of our Ideas of Beauty and Virtue</i> and a <i>System of Moral 
Philosophy</i>.<p>

By endeavoring to found a system of ethics on the observation of human 
nature as it actually is, Hutcheson imparted to the British philosophy 
of morals a distinctively empirical spirit. He taught that the faculty 
of moral discrimination and moral approval is not rational, nor yet 
aesthetic, in the sense of perceiving and approving merely the aspect of 
harmony or beauty, but a distinct power of the soul called moral sense. 
He maintained that there is in human nature, besides the egoistic 
instincts, a natural and instinctive desire to help and please others, 
and an equally instinctive feeling of approval of actions which aim at 
helping and pleasing others. The moral sense, which determines what 
actions are calculated to please and what actions are calculated to 
displease others, is distinct from reason; for reason merely aids us to 
find the means to given ends. The faculty of moral discrimination is 
not acquired by 
 <!--
BRITISH MORALISTS 499
 --><A NAME="p499"></a>
 experience, having been originally planted in the soul by the Creator 
to enable the rational creature to know what actions promote the 
welfare of others and also his own welfare in conformity with the 
welfare of others.<p>

<b>Joseph Butler</b> (1692 -- 1752), the author of the <i>Analogy</i>, 
developed in his <i>Sermons on Human Nature</i> a system of morals 
which is practically a theological application of Shaftesbury's ethical 
theory. Butler agrees with Shaftesbury and Hutcheson in maintaining the 
immediateness of the criterion of morality, which, however, he 
identifies, not with a sense of harmony, nor with a sense of the 
pleasure and usefulness which others experience from our actions, but 
with conscience. This guide of conduct is not a deduction from 
practical reason, as the schoolmen taught, but a faculty which directly 
and immediately approves or disapproves, and which must be obeyed 
without regard to the effect of our action on ourselves or others. It 
is not a distinctively religious sentiment; still, religion is its 
greatest aid, for in the "cool hour," when fervor and enthusiasm have 
deserted him, man finds in the thought of a future life a source of 
moral inspiration.<p>

<b>Adam Smith</b> (1723-1790), author of <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>, 
-- a work justly regarded as the first modern treatise on political 
economy, -- is the last, and if we except Hume the most important, 
representative of the empirical school of morals in the eighteenth 
century. His chief merit lies in the completeness and thoroughness of 
his psychological analysis of the criterion of morality. In his 
<i>Theory of Moral Sentiments</i> he develops a system of morals based 
on the principles that all moral judgment depends on participation in 
the feelings of the agent, and that an action is good if the spectator 
can sympathize with the end or effect of the action. He traces sympathy 
from its first manifestation (the power of imitating to a certain 
degree and participating to a certain extent in the feelings of others) 
to its culmination in moral appreciation and moral imperative.

<b>Historical Position</b>. The change brought about in the science of 
ethics by the British moralists of the eighteenth century was 
practically a revolution in the theory of morals. Shaftesbury, 
Hutcheson, and Smith, by reducing the subjective criterion of morality 
to feeling or sympathy, subverted the established idea of conscience as 
a dianoetic, or inferential, subjective norm, and substituted for it 
something which may be called an aesthetic or intuitional criterion. 
When, in studying the philosophy of the nineteenth century, we shall 
take up the course of the development of British systems of morals, we 
shall find the influence of French materialism in the hedonism of 
Bentham, and the influence of Kant in the importance which the 
successors of Bentham attach to the problem of the origin of moral 
obligation. The moralists of the eighteenth century were, apart from 
"Hutcheson's unconscious lapse into hedonism," altruistic, at least in 
tendency, and instead of concerning themselves with the analysis of the 
sense of obligation, devoted their attention exclusively to the 
analysis of the faculty of moral discrimination and moral approval.<p>
