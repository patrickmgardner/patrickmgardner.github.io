PHILOSOPHY OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA</h2>

<h3 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h3><p>

ALL who have studied the history of human thought in the light of the 
Christian idea of Providence have regarded the philosophy of Greece and 
Rome as a <i>preparatio evangelica</i>, -- a preparation for the Gospel 
of Christ. The Church which Christ founded was not, it is true, a 
school of philosophy. By virtue of its divine commission, it rose above 
all schools and all systems. Still, although Christ in his teachings 
discarded all formal definition and formal proof, these teachings 
reformed the world of speculation as they reformed the practical ideals 
of men, and the Church, being by its nature and essence endowed with 
that power of adaptation to external conditions which is characteristic 
of a living organism, has an inherent right to speak to each generation 
in the language which that generation best understands. In the 
systematic development of dogmatic truth the Church avails itself of 
the doctrines of philosophers and formulates its dogmas in the language 
of the schools of philosophy.<p>

Thus, the coming of Christ divides the history of philosophy as it 
divides the history of the world. From this point onward there will be 
the religious view and the rationalistic view of every question. 
Philosophy may profit by the teachings of religion; it may accept 
revelation as an extension of the horizon of human hopes, an opening up 
of new fields of human investigation; it may acknowledge the debt due 
to that institution to whose teaching we owe it that "doctrines 
concerning the nature of God, the immortality of the soul and the 
duties of men, which the noblest intellects of antiquity could barely 
grasp, have become the truisms of the village school, the proverbs of 
the cottage and of the alley."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Or, on the contrary, philosophy may 
deny the 
 <!--
216 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p216"></a>
 special authority of Christian revelation; it may cite the doctrines 
of Christ and His Church before the tribunal of reason, and pass 
sentence on them, denying the right of appeal to a higher court. 
Henceforth, then, there will be the religious attitude and the 
rationalistic attitude in presence of the great problems which ancient 
philosophy discussed without reference to any source of knowledge 
superior to reason itself. Christianity will be an ever-present factor 
in philosophical speculation: the rationalist who refuses its aid and 
the religious philosopher who accepts that aid must show reason for 
such refusal or acceptance. But, though the rationalistic spirit and 
the religious spirit pervade the whole history of the philosophy of the 
Christian era, they are not always present in equal proportion or in 
equal strength. From the first to the fifteenth century the religious 
spirit prevailed, while from the fifteenth century onward, the 
rationalizing spirit remained preponderant. There were rationalists in 
the first centuries, and there were religious-minded philosophers in the 
nineteenth; the difference on which the division is based is a 
difference in the spirit of the age, not in the character of individual 
philosophers. The prevailingly religious period is divided, according 
to another basis of division, into Patristic philosophy, extending from 
the first century to the period of the great invasions of the 
barbarians, and Scholastic philosophy, which begins with the 
reconstruction of European civilization in the ninth century and ends 
with the Reformation in the fifteenth. We may therefore divide the 
philosophy of the Christian era as follows<p>

SECTION A  --  PATRISTIC PHILOSOPHY, extending to the end of the  fifth 
century.<p>

SECTION B  --  SCHOLASTIC PHILOSOPHY, extending from the ninth century 
to the fifteenth.<p>

SECTION C  --  MODERN, OR POST-REFORMATION PHILOSOPHY, extending from 
the fifteenth century to our own time.

PATRISTIC PHILOSOPHY<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup></h2><p>

FROM the account given of pre-Christian systems of speculation it 
should be evident that philosophy, like every other department of human 
thought and human activity, is continuous in its growth. In 
philosophical speculation there is no possibility of breaking 
completely with the past, and so the philosophy of the first Christian 
writers was connected in its origin with the systems that preceded it. 
These writers took whatever truth the older systems contained and made 
it part of their own theory of reality, rejecting whatever contradicted 
the teachings of faith or whatever could not bear the light of reason 
reenforced by the light of revelation. From the beginning, however, the 
rationalizing spirit of which mention has been made, began to assert 
itself in a tendency on the part of some Christian writers to 
subordinate revelation to the teachings of pagan philosophy. It was 
from this tendency that the heretical systems sprang. At the same time, 
the religious spirit, working in the minds of the orthodox exponents of 
the teachings of Christianity, led them to place high above all human 
speculation the authority of Christ and His Church, although they did 
not reject the philosophy of the pagan world, but made use of it in 
their expositions of revealed truth. Writers of this class are the true 
philosophers of the early Christian era. On account of the influence 
which they 
 <!--
218 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p218"></a>
 exerted on succeeding generations, they are styled the Fathers, or 
spiritual progenitors of the Church's theology and philosophy. The 
orthodox Patristic philosophers are to be subdivided according as they 
undertook merely to defend Christianity against the misconceptions and 
calumnies of paganism, or sought to establish a positive system of 
Christian speculation. The <i>Apologists</i>, as the former are called, belong 
chiefly to the period of intellectual struggle which preceded the great 
Council of Nicaea (A.D. 325). The constructive thinkers of the Patristic 
period belong, for the most part, to the post-Nicene age.<p>

HERETICAL SYSTEMS</h3><p>

Of the heretical systems which sprang up during the first centuries of 
the Christian era, <i>Monarchianism, Arianism</i>, and 
<i>Apollinarism</i> belong exclusively to the history of theological 
opinions. <b>Gnosticism</b> and <b>Manicheism</b> are of greatest 
interest in the history of Patristic philosophy.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Besides the work entitled <i>Pistis Sophia</i> and a 
few fragments, which constitute the entire body of original Gnostic 
literature, we have the writings of <i>Irenaeus</i> and 
<i>Hippolytus</i>. To these must be added the works of <i>Clement of 
Alexandria, Origen, Eusebius, St. Augustine</i>, and the second of the 
<i>Enneads</i> of <i>Plotinus</i>. For our knowledge of Manichean 
doctrines we are indebted to the writings of <i>St. Augustine</i>.<p>

<i>Gnosticism</i>. <b>Cerinthus, Saturninus, Marcion, Carpocrates, 
Basilides</b>, and <b>Valentinus</b>, all of whom flourished during the 
second century, were the principal teachers of the Gnostic doctrine. 
 <!--
MANICHEISM 219  
 --><A NAME="p219"></a>
 Dissatisfied with the explanation which the Christian religion had to 
offer on such questions as the origin of evil and the nature of man, 
the Gnostics turned to pagan philosophy for a solution of these and 
other problems. But, while they thus made reason the basis and 
criterion of all truth, they were not willing to set aside altogether 
the authority of Christ's teaching. They had recourse, therefore, to 
the theory that Christ, besides the exoteric doctrines which He 
imparted to all His listeners, committed to His chosen disciples a 
higher esoteric doctrine, which constitutes the true essence of 
Christian teaching. This esoteric doctrine, <b>gn&ocirc;sis</b> is the 
alleged source of all that the Gnostics taught.<p>

In point of fact, the Gnostic teaching is a mixture of the philosophies 
of Philo and Plotinus with certain elements of Christianity. The 
Gnostics maintained the essential antithesis of the spiritual and the 
material; the origin, by emanation from God, of numberless 
<i>aeons</i>, the sum of which is the <i>pleroma</i>; and the final 
return of all things to God by a <i>universal redemption</i>. They 
recognized no mystery in the Christian sense of the word, the gnosis 
being the merest subterfuge, and human reason the really ultimate test 
of all truth, supernatural as well as natural.<p>

<i>Manicheism</i>. This sect was founded by <b>Manes</b>, a Persian, 
who in the third century became a Christian and sought to introduce 
into Christian theology and philosophy the Parsee conception of the 
dualism of God and Matter. There is no doubt that his followers, in 
developing the teachings of the founder of the sect, were influenced to 
a large extent by the Gnostic dualism, and laid claim, as the Gnostics 
did, to a special <i>gnosis</i>. They concerned themselves chiefly with 
<i>the problem of evil</i>, assuming the existence of two eternal 
principles, the one essentially good and the other essentially evil, 
and deriving from the latter all the evil, physical and moral, which 
exists in the world. They maintained that from the good principle there 
 <!--
220 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p220"></a>
 emanated, in the first place, primeval man, who was the first to enter 
into the struggle with evil; in the next place the Spirit of Life, who 
rescued primeval man from the powers of darkness; finally the
 World-Soul, Christ, the Son of primeval man, who restored to man the 
light which he had lost in the struggle with darkness. They 
distinguished in man two souls -- the soul that animates the body, 
and the soul of light, which is part of the World-Soul, Christ. The 
former is the creation of the powers of darkness, the latter is an 
emanation from light itself. Thus, man's soul is a battlefield on which 
light and darkness are at war, as they are in the universe. Human 
action depends on the outcome of the contest: there is no freedom of 
choice. All matter is evil and the cause of evil.<p>
