THE PERIPATETIC SCHOOL</h3><p>

<b>Sources</b>. Besides our <i>primary sources</i>, consisting of 
treatises and commentaries of the philosophers of Aristotle's school, 
we have, as secondary sources, the works of Diogenes Laertius and the 
references made by Cicero, who, it should be said, is more trustworthy 
when he mentions the Peripatetics than when he speaks of the
 pre-Socratic philosophers.<p>

<b>Theophrastus of Lesbos</b> was born about the same year as 
Aristotle. He seems to have become Aristotle's disciple even before the 
death of Plato. After Aristotle's death he ruled the Peripatetic school 
as scholarch for about thirty-five years. He wrote many works, of which 
the best known are two treatises on botany and his <i>Ethical 
Characters</i>, the latter consisting of lifelike delineations of types 
of human character. He extended and completed Aristotle's philosophy of 
nature, devoting special attention to the <i>science of botany</i>. In 
his ethical doctrines he insisted on the <i>choregia</i> secured to 
virtue by the possession of external goods.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Of the life of <b>Eudemus of Rhodes</b> little is known except that he 
and Theophrastus were disciples of Aristotle at the same time. It is 
probable that he continued to belong to the school 
 <!--
THE PERIPATETIC SCHOOL 159 
 --><A NAME="p159"></a>
 when Theophrastus became scholarch. He is the author of the Eudemian 
Ethics, which, however, is merely a redaction of Aristotle's notes, or 
at most a treatise intended to supplement Aristotle's <i>Nicomachean 
Ethics</i>.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> In his writings and doctrines Eudemus shows far less 
originality and independence than does Theophrastus.<p>

<b>Aritoxenus of Tarentum</b>, known as the <i>Musician</i>, introduced 
into the Peripatetic philosophy many of the ideas of the Pythagoreans, 
attaching especial importance to the notion of <i>harmony</i>.<p>

<b>Strato of Lampsacus</b>, the <i>Physicist</i>, succeeded 
Theophrastus as scholarch ip 288 B.C., and continued to preside over 
the school for eighteen years. Like his predecessor, he devoted his 
attention to <i>the study of nature</i>, manifesting, however, a 
tendency to discard from natural philosophy the teleological concept 
and the idea of the incorporeal.<p>

<b>Demetrius of Phalerus</b> and others of the earlier Peripatetics 
confined their literary labors to general history and <i>the history of 
opinions</i>.<p>

Among the later Peripatetics mention must be made of <b>Andronicus of 
Rhodes</b>, who edited the works of Aristotle (about 70 B.C.). To the 
second century of our era belong <b>Alexander of Aphrodisiae</b>, the 
<i>Exegete</i>, and <b>Aristocles of Messene</b>. To the third century 
belongs <b>Porphyry</b>, and to the sixth century <b>Philoponus</b> and 
<b>Simpliclus</b>. All these, though they belonged to Neo-Platonic or 
Eclectic schools, enriched the literature of the Peripatetic school by 
their commentaries on Aristotle. The physician <b>Galen</b>, born about 
131 A.D., is also reckoned among the interpreters of Aristotle.<p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. The second period of Greek philosophy has been 
characterized as <i>subjectivo-objective</i>. Compared with the 
preceding period, it is subjective, -- that is, it diverts the mind of 
the inquirer from the problems of nature to those of thought. Compared 
with the period immediately following, it is objective, -- that is, it 
is not concerned solely with ethical problems and 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p160"></a>
 the problems of the value of knowledge; it is not wholly subjective. 
Historically the period is short, not extending over more than three 
generations. Yet in that brief space of time much was accomplished. It 
is, perhaps, because the period was so short, and because it was 
dominated by three men, each of whom stood to his predecessor in the 
relation of personal disciple, that there exists so perfect an organic 
unity among the philosophies of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. The 
philosophy of Socrates was the philosophy of the concept, -- it was 
concerned with the inquiry into the conditions of scientific knowledge 
and the basis of ethics. The philosophy of Plato was the philosophy of 
the Idea, -- it claimed to be a scientific study of reality, a system 
of metaphysics. The philosophy of Aristotle was centered around the 
notion of essence, and essence implies the fundamental dualism of 
matter and form. It is in Aristotle's philosophy, therefore, that the 
objective and subjective are united in the highest and most perfect 
synthesis; for organic unity is compatible with growth in organic 
complexity. The concept is the simplest expression of the union of 
subject and object; next in complexity is the Idea, which is a form of 
being and knowing existing apart from what is and what is known, while 
highest in complexity is the essence, which is in part the matter and 
in part the form existing in the reality and also in the object of 
knowledge. From Socrates to Aristotle there is, therefore, a true 
development, the historical formula of which is ideally compact,  --  
<i>concept, Idea</i>, and <i>essence</i>.<p>
