ANTE-NICENE FATHERS</h3><p>

To the period extending from the beginning of the Christian era to the 
end of the third century belong the great Apologists, such as <b>Justin 
Martyr</b> (100-160), <b>Athenagoras</b> (died about 180), 
<b>Tatian</b>, and <b>Theophilus</b> (both belong to the end of the 
second century), who devoted their attention to the defense of 
Christianity against the last attacks of the representatives of pagan 
civilization. The period includes also <b>Irenaeus</b> (140-202), 
<b>Hippolytus</b> (first half of the third century), and 
<b>Tertullian</b> (160-240), whose life work consisted in the 
refutation of the Gnostics and other heretics. Finally the period 
includes <b>Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Arnobius</b>, and 
<b>Lactantius</b>, who, during the third and fourth centuries, 
expounded in their catechetical treatises the dogmas of Christianity, 
and developed in their exposition the first systems of constructive 
Christian philosophy.<p>

Tertullian's hostile attitude towards philosophy is expressed in the 
well-known <i>Credo quia absurdum</i>, which is attributed to him.

 must be remembered, however, that Tertullian, being a 
controversialist, was not always so measured in his language as he 
might have been, had he, like Clement and Origen, devoted himself to 
the task of building up a system of positive doctrine.<p>

<b>Clement of Alexandria</b><sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> (died about A.D. 217), in the 
<i>Cohortatio ad Gentes</i>, the <i>Pedagogus</i>, and the 
<i>Stromata</i> (<b>Str&ocirc;mateis</b>), exposes the extravagances 
and absurdities of paganism, and undertakes a systematic arrangement 
and defense of the moral and dogmatic teachings of the Church. 
Following Justin, he maintains on the one hand that whatever is true 
in Greek philosophy is to be traced to the Divine Logos, who 
"enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world," and on the other 
hand that whatever errors are found in Greek philosophy must be 
attributed to man's weak and erring nature. The true gnosis is not the 
alleged esoteric doctrine of Christ, but the teaching of the Gospels 
and of the Church which Christ founded. He who assents to the teaching 
of Christ and the Church, without striving, by the aid of philosophy, 
to give an intellectual basis to his assent, possesses faith, but he 
does not possess the gnosis, which is to faith what the full-grown man 
is to the child. Just as the Stoics idealized the "wise man," so did 
Clement set up the Christian Gnostic as the idealized type of the 
Christian.<p>

<b>Origen</b><sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> (185-254), a disciple of Clement, possessed by far the 
most synthetic mind among the Christian writers of this period. In his 
work, <b>peri arch&ocirc;n</b>, he exhibits a sense of system more 
imperative than that shown by any of his predecessors or 
contemporaries. He assimilated into his exposition of Christian dogma, 
elements from Plato, Aristotle, Philo, the Neo-P]atonists, and the 
Gnostics. On such questions as the preexistence of the human soul, the 
eternity of the world, and the <i>final return</i> of all things to God 
(apokatastasis), his orthodoxy has been a matter of dispute. His 
greatest achievement was the scientific

 formulation of the creationist account of the origin of the universe. 
It is true that Clement also taught the doctrine of creation, but he 
did not develop it so systematically as did Origen.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Clement and Origen are representatives of 
the great school of Alexandrian speculation which, in the third 
century, renewed the intellectual and philosophical prestige of the 
ancient capital of Egypt. Successful as Greek philosophy had been in 
defining the relations between matter and spirit, it had failed to 
determine satisfactorily the notion of personality and to explain the 
origin of primal matter. This is what Patristic speculation 
accomplished by its definition of the personalities of the Divine 
Trinity and by its doctrine of creation. The work begun by Clement and 
Origen was completed by their successors after the Council of Nicaea.<p>
