GREEK AND GRECO-ROMAN PHILOSOPHY</h2><p>

<b>Origin</b>. Greek philosophy first appeared in the Ionic colonies of 
Asia Minor, and never throughout the course of its development did it 
wholly lose the marks of its Oriental origin. Whether this influence 
was as preponderant as Roth and Gladisch contend,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> or as unimportant 
as Zeller and others maintain,<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> it is certain that the philosophy of 
Greece was characterized from the beginning by a spirit which is 
peculiarly Hellenic. The Greek looked out upon the world through an 
atmosphere singularly free from the mist of allegory and myth: the 
contrast between the philosophy of the East and the first attempts of 
the Ionian physicists is as striking as the difference between an 
Indian jungle and the sunny, breeze-swept shores of the Mediterranean.<p>

Greek Religion exercised hardly more than an indirect influence on 
Greek philosophy. Popular beliefs were so crude as to their speculative 
content that they could not long retain their hold on the mind of the 
philosopher. Consequently, such influence as they directly exercised 
was antagonistic to philosophy. Yet it was the popular beliefs which, 
by keeping alive among the Greeks an exquisite appreciation of form and 
an abiding sense of symmetry, did not permit the philosopher to take a 
partial or an isolated view of things. In this way Greek religion 
indirectly fostered that imperative desire for a totality of view 
which, in the best days of Greek speculation, enabled 
 <!--
GREEK POETRY 31
 --><A NAME="p31"></a>
 Greek philosophy to attain its most important results. In one 
particular instance Greek religion contributed directly to Greek 
philosophy by handing over to philosophy the doctrine of immortality,  
-- a doctrine which in every stage of its philosophical development 
has retained the mark of its theological origin. Plato, for example, 
distinctly refers it to the (Bacchic and Orphic) mysteries.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Poetry</b>. The philosophy as well as the religion of the Greeks 
found its first expression in poetry, philosophical speculation, 
properly so called, being preceded by the effort of the imagination to 
picture to itself the origin and the evolution of the universe. 
<b>Homer</b> presents, without analyzing, types of ethical character: 
Achilles, the indomitable; Hector, the chivalrous; Agamemnon, of kingly 
presence; Nestor, the wise; Ulysses, the wary; Penelope, the faithful. 
<b>Hesiod</b> gives us the first crude attempts at constructing a
 world-system. His cosmogony, however, is presented in the form of a 
theogony; there is as yet no question of accounting for the origin of 
things by natural causes. The so-called <b>Orphic Cosmogonies</b> had 
the Hesiodic theogony for their basis. They did not advance much 
farther in their inquiry than Hesiod himself had gone, unless we 
include as Orphic those systems of cosmology to which all scholars now 
agree in assigning a post-Aristotelian date. <b>Pherecydes of Syros</b> 
(about 540 B.C.) more closely approaches the scientific method. He 
describes Zeus, Chronos, and Chthon as the first beginnings of all 
things. There is here a basic thought that the universe sprang from the 
elements of air and earth, through the agency of time. This thought, 
however, the poet conceals under enigmatical symbols, referring the 
phenomena of nature not to natural agencies, but to the 
incomprehensible action of the gods.<p>

The beginnings of moral philosophy are found in the ethical portrayals 
of the Homeric poems, in the writings of the Gnomic  
 <!--
32 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p32"></a>
 Poets of the sixth century B.C., and especially in the sayings 
attributed to the <b>Seven Wise Men</b>. These sayings are 
characterized by a tone of cynicism, and exhibit a knowledge of the 
world's ways which is certainly remarkable if it belongs to the age to 
which it is generally assigned.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The <i>Division</i> of Greek philosophy into periods and schools is 
partly chronological and partly dependent on the development of 
philosophic thought. The following seems to be the most convenient 
arrangement:  
<ul>
<li>I. Pre-Socratic Philosophy. 
<li>II. Philosophy of Socrates and the Socratic Schools. 
<li>III. Post-Aristotelian Philosophy.  
</ul><p>

In the first period, the era of beginnings, philosophical speculation 
was largely objective; it busied itself with the study of nature and 
the origin of the world. In the second period Socrates brought 
philosophy down to the contemplation of man's inner self; it was a 
period in which the objective and subjective methods were blended. In 
the third period the subjective element was made preponderant; the 
Stoics and Epicureans concerned themselves with man and his destiny, to 
the almost complete exclusion of cosmological and metaphysical 
problems.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The sources of Greek philosophy are:<p>

<i>Primary sources</i>. Besides the complete works of Plato and 
Aristotle, we have several collections of fragments of philosophical 
writings; for instance, Mullach's <i>Fragmenta Philosophorum 
Graecorum</i>, Ritter and Preller's <i>Historia Philosophiae 
Graecae</i>, Diels' <i>Doxographi Graeci</i>, Fairbanks' <i>The First 
Philosophers of Greece</i>, Adams, <i>Texts</i>, etc. (New York, 1903).

<h2 align="center">FIRST PERIOD  --  PRE-SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY</h2><p>

This period comprises: (1) the <i>Ionian School</i> --  the 
philosophers of this school confined their attention to the study of 
Nature and sought out the material principle of natural phenomena; (2) 
the Pythagoreans, who made Number the basis of their philosophical 
system; (3) the Eleatics, whose speculations centered in the doctrine 
of the oneness and immutability of 
 <!--

 Being; (4) the <i>Sophists</i>, who, negatively, showed the 
unsatisfactory nature of all Knowledge, while, positively, they 
occasioned the inquiry into the conditions and limitations of 
knowledge.<p>

<h3 align="center">CHAPTER I<br>
EARLIER IONIAN SCHOOL</h3><p>

The Ionian school includes the Earlier Ionians, -- <b>Thales</b>, 
<b>Anaximander</b>, and <b>Anaximenes</b>, -- and the Later Ionians, whose 
proper historical place is after the Eleatic school.<p>

THALES<p>

<b>Life</b>. Thales, the first philosopher of Greece, was of Phoenician 
descent. He was born at Miletus, about the year 620 B.C.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> He was a 
contemporary of Croesus and Solon, and was counted among the Seven Wise 
Men. He is said to have died in the year 546 B.C.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Our knowledge of the doctrines of Thales is based 
entirely on secondary sources, especially on the account given by 
Aristotle in <i>Met.</i>, I, 3, 983. <i>cf.</i> Ritter and Preller, <i>op. cit.</i>, 
pp. 9-11.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

According to Aristotle, Thales taught that out of water all things are 
made.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Historical tradition is silent as to the reasons by which 
Thales was led to this conclusion. It is possible, as Aristotle 
conjectures, that the founder of the Ionian school was influenced by 
the consideration of the moisture of nutriment, etc.; he may have based 
his conclusion on a rationalistic interpretation of the myth of 
Oceanus, or he may have observed the alluvial deposits of the rivers of 
his native country, and concluded that, as earth, so all things else 
come from water. The saying that  
 <!--
ANAXIMANDER 35 
 --><A NAME="p35"></a>
 "The magnet has a soul because it attracts iron" is attributed to 
Thales on the authority of Aristotle, who, however, speaks 
conditionally, "if, indeed, he said," etc. We must not attach 
importance to Cicero's Stoical interpretation of Thales: "Thales 
Milesius aquam dixit esse initium rerum, Deum, autem, eam mentem quae 
ex aqua cuncta fingeret." Such a dualism belongs to the time of 
Anaxagoras. Similarly, the saying that "All things are full of gods" 
(<b>panta pl&ecirc;ra the&ocirc;n</b>) is but the expression, in 
Aristotle's own phraseology, of the general doctrine of animism, or 
hylozoism, which is a tenet common to all the Earlier Ionians. They 
maintained that matter is instinct with life; or, as an Aristotelian 
would say, they did not distinguish between the material principle and 
the formal principle of life.<p>

ANAXIMANDER<p>

<b>Life</b>. Anaximander, who was also a native of Miletus, was born 
about the year 610 B.C. Theophrastus describes him as a disciple, or 
associate, of Thales. The date of his death is unknown.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. <i>Primary sources</i>. Anaximander composed a treatise, or 
rather a poetical prose composition, <b>peri phusi&ocirc;s</b>, which 
was extant when Theophrastus wrote. Of this work two sentences only 
have come down to us:<p>

1. "All things must in equity again decline into that whence they have 
their origin, for they must give satisfaction and atonement for 
injustice, each in order of time."<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup><p>

2. The infinite "surrounds all things and directs all things."<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Secondary sources</i>. Our chief secondary sources are Theophrastus 
(in the work <b>phusik&ocirc;n doxai</b>, of which the existing 
fragments are published by Diels, <i>op. cit.</i>, p.476) and Aristotle 
(especially in <i>Met.</i>, XII, 2, 1069 b; <i>Phys.</i>. III, 4 203 
b).  
 <!--
36 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
  --><A NAME="p36"></a>
DOCTRINES<p>

From our secondary sources it is evident that, according to 
Anaximander, the originating principle (<b>arch&ecirc;</b>)<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> of all 
things is the <i>Infinite</i>, or rather the <i>Unlimited</i> 
(<b>apeiron</b>). The reasons, however, which led to this conclusion 
are merely a matter of conjecture, as in the case of Thales' 
generalization. According to Aristotle, Anaximander, supposing that 
change destroys matter, argued that, unless the substratum of change is 
limitless, change must sometime cease. Thus, while modern physics holds 
that matter is indestructible, Anaximander maintained that it is 
infinite; for there can be no question as to the corporeal nature of 
the <b>apeiron</b> it is an infinite material substance. Critics, however, 
do not agree as to how Anaximander would have answered the questions, 
Is the unlimited an element or a mixture of elements? Is it 
qualitatively simple or complex? He certainly maintained that the 
primitive substance is infinite, but did not, so far as we know, 
concern himself with the question of its qualitative determinations.<p>

The <b>apeiron</b> has been likened to the modern notion of space and 
to the mythological concept of chaos. It is described by Anaximander 
himself as surrounding and directing all things, and by Aristotle it is 
described as <b>to theion</b>. We must not, however, attach to these 
expressions a dualistic or pantheistic meaning.<p>

From the Boundless all things came, by a process which the 
<i>Placita</i><sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> describes as separation (apokrith&ecirc;nai). Living 
things sprang from the original moisture of the earth (through the  
 <!--
ANAXIMENES 37 
 --><A NAME="p37"></a>
 agency of heat). The first animals were therefore fishes, which after 
they came on shore threw off their scales and assumed new shapes. Man, 
too, was generated from other kinds of animals.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> Anaximander is 
generally believed to have taught an infinity of worlds.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Comparing the doctrines of Anaximander with 
what we know of the teachings of Thales, we find that the former are 
far richer in their contents and betoken a higher development of 
speculative thought. They represent a higher grade of abstraction, as 
is evident in the substitution of the Boundless for the concrete 
substance, water.<p>

ANAXIMENES<p>

<b>Life</b>. Anaximenes of Miletus, who was an "associate" of 
Anaximander, composed a treatise the title of which is unknown. He died 
about 528 B.C.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. <i>Primary sources</i>. The only fragment of the work 
of Anaximenes which has survived is a sentence quoted in the 
<i>Placita</i>. "Just as our soul, being air, holds us together, so do 
breath and air encompass the world."<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Secondary sources</i>. Our principal secondary source is 
Theophrastus, whom pseudo-Plutarch, Eusebius (<i>Praepratio 
Evangelica</i> ), Hippolytus (<i>Refutatio Omnium Heresium</i>), etc., 
follow. <i>cf.</i> Diels, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 476.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

According to all our secondary sources, Anaximenes taught that the 
principle, or ground, of all material existence is <i>air</i>. 
(<b>a&ecirc;r</b> must, however, be taken in the Homeric sense of 
vapor, or mist.) This substance, to which is ascribed infinite 
quantity, is endowed with life. From it, by thinning 
(<b>arai&ocirc;sis</b>) and thickening (<b>puke&ocirc;sis</b>), were 
formed fire, winds, clouds, water, and earth. 
 <!--
38 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
 --><A NAME="p38"></a>
 The world is an animal, whose breathing is kept up by masses of air, 
which it inhales from the infinite space beyond the heavens.<p>

Cicero incorrectly represents Anaximenes as identifying the divinity 
with the primitive Air. St. Augustine is more correct when he says, 
"Nec deos negavit aut tacuit, non tamen ab ipsis aerem factum, sed ipsos 
ex aere ortos credidit."<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Anaximenes was evidently influenced by his 
predecessors. From Thales he derived the qualitative determinateness of 
the primitive substance and from Anaximander its infinity. The doctrine 
of "thickening" and "thinning" is far more intelligible than the 
doctrine of "separating" which Anaximander taught.<p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. The Early Ionian philosophers were students of 
nature (<b>physiologoi</b>) who devoted themselves to the inquiry into 
the origin of things. They agreed (1) in positing the existence of a 
single original substance; (2) in regarding this substance as endowed 
with force and life (hylozoism). They were dynamists. Heraclitus, a 
Later Ionian, who was in final analysis a dynamist also, marks the 
transition from the early hylozoism to the mechanism of the Later 
Ionian school.<p>
