THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT</h3><p>

As an inevitable result of the Sceptical and Eclectic tendencies of the 
age, the natural and mathematical sciences gradually broke loose from 
philosophy. They flourished especially in the Greek islands of the 
Mediterranean and in Egypt, because there they were free from the 
disheartening influences which at Athens

 and elsewhere in Hellas led to the dissolution of classical culture 
and classical philosophy.<p>

In Sicily, where the Pythagorean tradition was still unbroken, 
<b>Hicetas</b> and <b>Archimedes</b> taught, as early as the third 
century before Christ, a system of astronomy which was far superior to 
the astronomical doctrines of Plato and Aristotle.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> About the same 
time <b>Aristarchus</b> of Samos advanced the hypothesis that the earth 
moves round the sun. This theory was stamped as impious by the Stoics 
and rejected by Ptolemy himself; it did not succeed in supplanting the 
old conception until the dawn of modern times, when its truth was 
demonstrated by Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo.<p>

At Alexandria there developed under the influence of the Ptolemies a 
new phase of philosophic thought, the study of which belongs to the 
history of Greco-Oriental philosophy. Side by side with this new 
philosophy there grew up a new science, of which Euclid (about 300 
B.C.) is the chief representative. He wrote the <i>Elements of 
Geometry</i> and treatises on <i>Harmony, Optics</i>, and 
<i>Catoptrics</i>. <b>Ptolemy</b> (Claudius Ptolemaeus), who lived 
about the middle of the second century after Christ, belongs also to 
the Alexandrian school of science. His work, the <i>Almagest</i>, or 
<b>megal&ecirc; suntaxis</b> continued to be the authoritative source 
of astronomical learning until the time of Copernicus.<p>
