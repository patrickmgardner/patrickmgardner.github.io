WILLIAM OF OCKAM</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. William of Ockam, <i>Venerabilis Inceptor, Doctor 
Invincibilis</i>, is by far the most important philosopher of this 
period. He was born at Ockam, in Surrey, about the year 1280. It is 
said that he studied at Merton College, Oxford, where it is possible he 
had Duns Scotus for teacher.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> There seems to be some doubt as to his 
having followed the lectures of Scotus at Paris. He taught at Paris 
between the years 1320 and 1323. After quitting his chair at Paris, he 
threw in his lot with the opponents of the temporal power of the popes, 
was imprisoned at Avignon, escaped in 1328, and sought refuge at the 
court of Louis of Bavaria, to whom he made the well-known promise: "Tu 
me defendas gladio, ego te defendam calamo." It is not known with 
certainty where and when he died, but it is probable that he died at 
Munich in 1349.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Ockam's principal philosophical works are <i>Super Quatuor 
Libros Sententiarum, Quodlibeta, Tractatus Logices</i>, and <i>Commentaries on 
 <!--
WILLIAM OF OCKAM 405 
 --><A NAME="p405"></a>
 Aristotle</i>. In addition he wrote several controversial works in 
support of the claims of the State against the Church. His 
<i>Commentary on the Books of Sentences</i> was published by Trechsel, 
at Lyons, in 1495. For bibliography and list of Ockam's controversial 
writings, <i>cf.</i> Potthast, Wegweiser, p. 871.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Nominalism</b>. Ockam is best known by his renewal of nominalism. It 
would, however, be more correct to describe his doctrine of universals 
as a modified conceptualism. In his <i>Commentary on the Books of 
Sentences</i><sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> he enumerates three different opinions concerning 
universals, and then continues:<p>

<blockquote>
Quarta posset esse opinio quod nihil est universale ex natura sua sed 
tantum ex institutione, illo modo quo vox est universalis. Sed haec 
opinio videtur non vera.
</blockquote><p>

In the <i>Tractatus Logices</i><sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> he formulates his own doctrine that 
the universal is an intention of the mind:<p>

Nullum universale est substantia quomodocumque consideretur, sed 
quodlibet universale est intentio animae quae secundum unam opinionem 
probabilem ab actu intelligendi non distinguitur.<p>

Nevertheless, it is true that Ockam is, in a certain sense, a 
nominalist. He maintains, for example, that <i>propositions</i>, not 
<i>things</i>, are the objects of scientific knowledge:<p>

<blockquote>
Scientia quaelibet, sive sit realis sive rationalis, est tantum de 
propositionibus tamquam de illis quae sciuntur, quod solae 
propositiones sciuntur.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> 
</blockquote><p>

Ockam, therefore, is a conceptualist who uses the language of 
nominalism: he does not subscribe to the doctrine that the name 
(<i>vox</i>) is alone universal, but, distinguishing between the <i>vox 
scripta et prolata</i> and the <i>vox concepta</i>, or the term as it 
exists in the mind (<i>intentio animae</i>), he declares that the 
latter alone possesses universality. He is a terminist rather than a 
nominalist. Ockam, it should be said, devoted special attention 
 <!--
406 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p406"></a>
 to the development of the logical doctrine of supposition as 
formulated in the <i>Summulae</i> of Petrus Hispanus. He would 
distinguish, therefore, between the meaning of the word and the 
supposition of the term, and would attribute universality to the 
supposition as well as to the meaning.<p>

But, although Ockam did not profess the cruder form of nominalism, he 
may justly be considered the forerunner of the nominalists who appeared 
at the close of the fourth period of the history of Scholasticism.<p>

<b>Psychology</b>. Since the only reality is the individual, the 
individual is the only object of knowledge. There is, therefore, no 
need of an intermediary <i>species</i>: knowledge takes place by 
immediate contact of subject with object: it is intuitive. There is, 
indeed, a kind of knowledge which Ockam calls abstractive; this, he 
maintains, has nothing to do with really existing things.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> All 
knowledge of reality is intuitive.<p>

It follows that the active intellect is as useless as are the 
<i>species</i>. Ockam, however, preserves the terms <i>active 
intellect</i> and <i>passive intellect</i> to designate the active and 
passive phases of the activity of the mind:<p>

<blockquote>
Intellectus agens et intellectus possibilis sunt omnino idem re et 
ratione. Ideo dico quod non est ponenda pluralitas sine necessitate.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote>
  
The principle here enunciated is known as the <i>Law of Parcimony</i>, 
or more commonly as "Ockam's razor."<p>

Ockam distinguishes between the rational soul and the sensitive form in 
man. The latter is extended and is corruptible:<p>

<blockquote>
Praeter animam intellectivam est ponere aliam formam, scil. 
sensitivam, super quam potest agens naturale corrumpendo et producendo: 
et ideo non sequitur quod haec esset incorruptibilis.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

It is this sensitive soul which is united immediately with the body. 
With regard to the rational soul, neither reason nor experience can 
prove that the principle of understanding is the  
 <!--
WILLIAM OF OCKAM 407 
 --><A NAME="p407"></a>
 substantial form of the human body. It follows that <i>reason cannot 
demonstrate the immortality of the individual soul</i>: Aristotle's 
authority cannot be invoked because he speaks hesitatingly: we are 
obliged, therefore, to accept these truths as matters of faith.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> This 
leads to the next point, --<p>

<b>Ockam's Scepticism</b>. Ockam does not deny the possibility of 
arriving at certitude. The sceptical tendency in his philosophy 
manifests itself in the attempt to restrict the power of human reason. 
We have just seen that he relegates the immortality of the soul to the 
sphere of faith. In the list of truths which human reason cannot prove 
he includes the existence, unity, and infinity of God, and the 
immediate creation of the universe by God.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> The same peculiar form of 
scepticism appears in<p>

<b>His Ethical Doctrines</b>. Ockam, following Scotus, maintains that 
right and wrong depend on the will of God, and thus endangers the 
necessity and immutability of the principles of morality. "Eo ipso quod 
voluntas divina hoc vult, ratio recta dictat quod est volendum."<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The principles which Ockam formulated led 
to materialistic scepticism. Ockam was, however, saved from the 
explicit advocacy of materialism by his belief in the supernatural 
order of truth. If we exclude the element of faith and take his 
philosophy as it stands, we must pronounce him to be the forerunner of 
the anti-Christian philosophers of the Renaissance. He has been 
described as the first Protestant. And, indeed, he defended in his 
controversial writings the principles subsequently invoked by the 
first reformers to justify the encroachments of the secular power. In 
philosophy, too, his whole attitude is one of protest against the 
prevailing realism, and against the belief that he study of philosophy 
can be of material aid to theological sciences. In an age when theism  
 <!--
408 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p408"></a>
 and spiritualism were universally taught as philosophical tenets, he 
protested, in the name of human reason, that belief in God and in the 
spirituality of the human soul has no foundation except in 
revelation.<p>
