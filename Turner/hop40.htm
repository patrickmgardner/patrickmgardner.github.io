HENRY OF GHENT</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. Henry of Ghent, <i>Doctor Solemnis</i>, was born at or 
near Ghent in the first or second decade of the thirteenth century. 
Very little is known about his early life. In 1267 he became canon of 
Tournai. Later on he taught with distinction at the University of Paris 
and took part in the discussion which arose in 1282 concerning the 
privileges of the mendicants in regard to hearing confessions. Between 
1284 and 1293 he made several journeys from Paris to Tournai. He died in 
1293, hut whether at Paris or at Tournai is uncertain.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The most important of Henry's works are his <i>Summa 
Theologica</i> and his <i>Quodlibet</i>. The former was published at 
Ghent in 1520 and again at Ferrara in 1646; the latter was published at 
Paris in 1518, at Venice in 1608, and again at Venice in 1613.

Henry's system of philosophy agrees, in its general outlines, with the 
philosophy of St. Thomas. There are, however, some points of 
difference:<p>

1. <b>Relation of Philosophy to Theology</b>. While agreeing with St. 
Thomas that philosophy and theology are distinct sciences, 
 <!--
HENRY OF GHENT 385 
 --><A NAME="p385"></a>
 and that each has its proper object, Henry insists that philosophy is 
not to be studied for its own sake, but as an aid to theology:<p>

<blockquote> 
Non licet scientias philosophicas addiscere nisi in usum hujus 
scientiae (theologiae). Qui enim philosophicas scientias discunt, finem 
statuendo in ipsis propter scire naturas rerum . . . , isti sunt qui 
ambulant in vanitate sensus sui.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

2. <b>Principle of Individuation</b>. The principle of individuation is 
not matter with its determined dimensions, as St. Thomas taught, but a 
negative property of the <i>suppositum</i>, or individual. Henry 
teaches that the remote cause of individuation is matter, inasmuch as 
matter is the basis of multiplicity, but that the proximate cause is 
something which is distinct from matter although it is not a positive 
reality:<p>

<blockquote>
Oportet eas (formas creaturarum) individuari ut habeant rationem 
suppositi. . . . Sed quid est in supposito praeter formam quo habet esse 
hoc? . . . Dico aliquid praeter materiam et praeter agens quod est quasi 
dispositio suppositi in quantum suppositum est. . . . Sic ergo nonnisi 
determinatione negationis . . . fit et individuatio et suppositi 
constitutio.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

3. <b>Distinction between Essence and Existence</b>. Henry denies the 
real distinction between essence and existence, thus returning to the 
doctrine of Alexander of Hales and the first schoolmen of the 
thirteenth century. He maintains the thesis "Esse sunt diversa 
quorumcumque essentiae sunt diversae."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

4. <b>Plurality of Substantial Forms</b>. Henry maintains that besides 
the rational soul there is in man another substantial form, the 
<i>forma corporeitatis</i>, or <i>forma commixtionis corporalis</i>. 
His argument is as follows: "Aliter enim nihil omnino homo in 
generatione hominis generaret substantiale, sed tantummodo 
corrumperet."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> This form is the famous <i>mediator plasticus</i> of 
later Scholasticism.<p>

5. <b>Theory of Knowledge</b>. Misunderstanding the Scholastic doctrine 
of ideation, Henry, while admitting, in the case of 
 <!--
386 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p386"></a>
 sense-knowledge, the existence of the <i>species sensibilis</i> as a 
substitute for the object, denies the existence of the intelligible 
species on the ground that the phantasm, by becoming spiritualized, 
determines the intellect to the act of knowledge:<p>

<blockquote>
In vi sensitiva apprehensiva requiritur species objecti. . . . In vi 
autem apprehensiva intellectus, nulla species requiritur de objecto, 
quia ipsum (objectum) existens in phantasmate, factum universale, 
praesens est et simul cum intellectu.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

6. <b>Augustinianism</b>. In more than one point of doctrine Henry of 
Ghent returns to the Augustinian and Platonic tradition of the eleventh 
century. For example, he attaches great importance to intellectual 
memory, teaches that there is no real distinction between the soul and 
its faculties, and adds to the Augustinian doctrine of exemplarism the 
theory of a special illumination by which man attains a transcendent 
knowledge of the essences of things as they exist in the Divine Mind 
and of supernatural truth:<p>

<blockquote>
Naturali enim appetitu bene desiderat (homo) scire etiam illa quae sunt 
supernaturaliter cognoscenda, quae secundum communem illustrationem a 
divino exemplari sine illustratione specialiori non potest 
attingere.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

7. <b>Superiority of Will to Intellect</b>. Henry is the first of the 
mediaeval voluntarists. He maintains the superiority of will with 
respect to intellect. Intellect, indeed, precedes will; nevertheless, 
will is the more perfect faculty, intellect being merely its servant:<p>

<blockquote>
Omnino habitus et actus et objectum voluntatis praeeminet actui, habitui 
et objecto intellectus: idcirco absolute dicendum quod voluntas 
praeeminet intellectui et est altior potentia illo.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Henry of Ghent contributed to Scholastic 
philosophy a very able refutation of scepticism. His renewal of the 
Augustinian tradition, which had been so important in 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p387"></a>
 the schools of the centuries preceding the thirteenth, was in keeping 
with the teachings of the Franciscan masters, and helped to prepare the 
way for the era of greater Franciscan influence inaugurated by Duns 
Scotus.<p>
