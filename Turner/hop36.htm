<h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXXVI<br>
THE PANTHEISTIC SCHOOL<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

The pantheism which appeared in the schools towards the end of the 
twelfth century was the outcome of many influences, of which the most 
important were the realistic Platonism of the school of Chartres, the 
natural drift of mysticism towards pantheism, the growing influence of 
Arabian speculation, and the revival of the study of Erigena's <i>De 
Divisione Naturae</i>.<p>

<b>Bernard of Tours</b> (<i>Bernardus Silvestris</i>), who lived during 
the second half of the twelfth century, composed a work <i>De Mundi 
Universitate</i>,<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> which he dedicated to Theodoric of Chartres, thus 
indicating the affiliation of the first form of pantheism which 
appeared in the twelfth century to the school of Chartres. The work is 
an attempt at deducing a cosmic system from a monad by means of the 
doctrine of emanation. In method and manner it recalls the treatises of 
the Neo-Pythagoreans of Alexandria.<p>

AMAURY OF B&Egrave;NE<p>

<b>Life</b>. Amaury (or Amalric) of B&egrave;ne, or of Chartres, taught 
theology and dialectic at Paris during the second half of the twelfth 
century. After his condemnation in 1204, he was obliged to retire from 
Paris. His books were destroyed, and the date of his death is unknown. 
The birthplace of Amaury (which is near Chartres) suggests the early 
influence of the members of the school of Chartres, and it is now 
almost universally conceded that during the last decades of the twelfth 
century the works of Erigena were so widely known that it is natural to 
suppose that Amaury was acquainted with Erigena's doctrines.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
THE PANTHEISTIC SCHOOL 307  
 --><A NAME="p307"></a><p>

<b>Sources</b>. In the absence of primary sources, it is necessary to 
have recourse to secondary authorities. Chief among these is 
<i>Gerson</i> (1363-1429).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

St&ouml;ckl, relying on Gerson's account, attributes to Amaury the 
following doctrines:<p>

1. <i>Identity of creature and Creator:</i> "Cum in Ipso sint omnia, 
imo Ipse sit omnia . . . non facile posse negari Creatorem et creaturam 
idem esse."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

2. <i>Substantial unity of all things:</i> "Omnia esse unum. Deum esse 
essentiam omnium creaturarum et esse unum."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

3. Realism, based on <i>identity of specific nature:</i> "Alterius 
naturae non est Abraham et alterius Isaac, sed unius et ejusdem."<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup><p>

This account, given by Gerson, is confirmed by the testimony of the 
Council of Paris (1210) at which Amaury was condemned, and by the work 
<i>Contra Amaurianos</i>, written about 1208, against the followers of 
Amaury, who seem to have been numerous at that time.<p>

Associated with Amaury is <b>Joachim de Floris</b> (died 1202), who is 
referred to by St. Thomas and Albertus Magnus as maintaining "Essentia 
genuit essentiam."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Consult Denifle, <i>Archiv</i>, I, 50 ff.<p>

DAVID OF DINANT<p>

<b>Life</b>. David of Dinant seems to have evolved his doctrine of 
pantheism independently of the influence of Amaury and of the school of 
Chartres. He drew largely from Arabian sources. Denifle publishes<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> a 
text in which Albertus Magnus refers to a certain Alexander as the man 
from whom David derived his heresy. It is more probable that it was 
Dominicus Gundisalvi who made David conversant with the literature of 
Arabian pantheism. It is certain at all events that David studied the 
philosophy of Erigena.

 profane learning. The twelfth century, however, was an age in which 
the genuine representatives of the Scholastic movement knew how to 
defend themselves. They were strong with the vigor of youth, and, 
believing in the justice of their cause, they successfully repelled 
every attack, so that out of the struggles which the twelfth century 
witnessed there came forth a victorious Scholasticism prepared for the 
great constructive task to be accomplished in the following century. 
The results achieved by Scholastism in the second period of its history 
include: (1) the success of the anti-realists; (2) the recognition of 
the Scholastic method as a legitimate method in philosophy and 
theology; (3) the establishment of a broader spirit of culture, of a 
"humanism" which admitted that the Neo-Latin civilization had much to 
learn from the civilizations of Greece and of the Orient. These results 
will appear in the writings of the first schoolmen of the third period.<p>

BYZANTINE, ARABIAN, AND JEWISH PHILOSOPHY<p>

BYZANTINE PHILOSOPHY<p>

Hellenistic philosophy, banished from Athens by Justinian (529) and 
driven from Alexandria by the Arabs (640), was perpetuated at 
Constantinople by an irregular and intermittent tradition which, after 
the great schism (858) that separated the East from the West, took the 
form of commentary on and exposition of the works of Plato and 
Aristotle. <b>Michael Psellus</b> (the elder) and <b>Photius</b><sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> are 
the chief representatives of this tradition in the ninth century; 
<b>Arethas</b>, <b>Wicetas</b> the Paphlagonian, and <b>Suidas</b> 
represent it in the tenth century; <b>Michael Psellus</b> (the younger) 
is the sole representative of Byzantine learning in the eleventh 
century: <b>Johannes Italus</b>, <b>Anna Comnena</b>, daughter of the 
Emperor Alexis, and <b>Michael Ephesius</b> brought Byzantine learning 
to its highest degree of development in the twelfth century; finally, 
<b>Nicephorus Blemmydes</b> and <b>George Pachymeres</b> are the best 
known of the Byzantine scholars of the thirteenth century, the age in 
which the learning of Constantinople made its first impression on the
 <!--
ARABIAN PHILOSOPHY 311
 --><A NAME="p311"></a>
 Scholastic movement.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> Although the influence of the learning of 
Constantinople on the progress of philosophic thought in western Europe 
may be said to begin with the first Crusade (1096-1100), yet it was 
not until the taking of Constantinople by the Crusaders in 1204 that 
the treasures of ancient Greek literature and philosophy were thrown 
open to the schoolmen. The debt which Scholasticism owes to Byzantine 
learning should not be exaggerated; at the same time we must not 
underrate the importance of the introduction of the original and 
complete works of Aristotle into western Europe at a time when the 
Aristotle of the Arabians was being invoked as the champion of 
pantheism and rationalism.<p>

ARABIAN PHILOSOPHY<p>

The Arabians received Aristotle's works from the Syrians and Persians, 
who in 529 gave shelter to the philosophers banished from Athens by 
Justinian. The most important of the translators and commentators who 
made Aristotle and Plato intelligible to these Oriental peoples are 
<b>David the Armenian</b> (sixth century), the Nestorian Christians of 
the schools of Edessa and Chalcis (fifth and sixth centuries), and 
<b>Honain ben Isaac</b>, who, in the ninth century, began a series of 
translations from Syriac into Arabic. It is, therefore, beyond dispute 
that the Arabians owe their knowledge of Greek philosophy to the Syrian 
Christians.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The classic works on Arabian philosophy are: Munk, 
<i>M&eacute;langes</i>, etc. (Paris, 1859); articles by Munk in the 
<i>Dictionnaire des sciences philosophiques</i>; Renan's <i>De 
Philosophia peripatetica <i>apud</i> Syros</i> (Paris, 1852), and his 
<i>Averro&egrave;s et l'Averro&iuml;sme</i> (Paris, 1869). To the 
bibliography given by Weber (p. 211) and Ueberweg (p. 406) add M. 
Forget's articles in <i>N&eacute;o-Scolastique</i> (1894), Figuier, 
<i>Vies des savants du Moyen Age</i> (Paris, 2883), and De Vaux, 
<i>Avicenne</i> (Paris, 1900).<p>

SKETCH OF SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY AMONG THE ARABIANS<p>

Speculative thought among the Arabians passed through the following 
phases:<p>

1. <i>Primitive unquestioning belief in the Koran</i>. From the middle 
of the seventh century until the middle of the eighth, the authority of 
the Koran was supreme among the followers of Mahomet. 
 <!--
312 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p312"></a><p>

2. <i>Motazilites, or dissidents</i>. This sect represented a 
rationalistic movement against the orthodox fatalism and 
anthropomorphism, -- a movement occasioned by the contact (A.D. 750) 
of the Mussulman with the civilization of Persia, Bahylonia, and 
Assyria.<p>

3. <i>Motacallim&icirc;n, or professors of the word</i>. These were the 
first theologians of Islam. In their effort to expound the Koran 
rationalistically, and yet without exceeding the limits of orthodox 
belief, and in the use which they made of the philosophy of the Greeks, 
they resemble the schoolmen of Christian Europe. The Motacallimin 
received encouragement and patronage from the Abbassides, who began to 
rule as caliphs about the year 750.<p>

4. <i>Sufis, or mystics</i>. These represented a more extreme phase of 
the theological reaction against rationalism. They flourished chiefly 
in the Persian portion of the Arabian empire. Distrusting reason and 
philosophy, they taught that the only source of truth is the Koran, and 
that the reading of the Koran is to be supplemented by ecstatic 
contemplation.<p>

5. <i>Philosophers</i>. The philosophical movement among the Arabians 
extended from the ninth century to the end of the twelfth. The 
philosophers were, in a sense, the continuators of the dissident 
movement. As a rule, they disregarded the authority of the Koran, and 
built their systems of philosophy upon lines traced by the Greeks, 
whose works they obtained from the Syrian Christians. They were opposed 
by the mystics and persecuted by the caliphs both in Asia and in 
Europe.<p>

The chief philosophers are: (1) Among the Arabians of the East, 
<b>Alkendi</b> (died 870), <b>Alfarabi</b> (died 950), <b>Avicenna</b> 
(Ibn Sina) (980-1037), and <b>Algazel</b> (1059-1111); (2) Among the 
Arabians of the West, that is, in  Spain, <b>Avempace</b> (died 1138), 
<b>Abubacer</b> (1100-1185), and <b>Averroes</b> (Ibn Roshd) (1126-1198).<p>

<b>Avicenna</b>, physician, philosopher, and theologian, was born in 
the province of Bokhara. He composed a medical Canon and numerous 
philosophical works in which he expounded the doctrines of Aristotle 
and of his Greek commentators. He devoted special attention to 
metaphysics, maintaining the existence of a Sovereign Intelligence as 
the highest reality, and of matter, or the non-existent, as the lowest 
in the scale of being. The first emanation from the Supreme 
Intelligence is the active intellect, to which Avicenna assigns a 
metaphysical as well as a psychological r&ocirc;le, teaching that it is 
the source of all heavenly and earthly intellects, and that it is the 
principle by which the potentially intelligible becomes actually 
intelligible to the human mind.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--
ARABIAN PHILOSOPHY 313  
 --><A NAME="p313"></a><p>

Despite these Neo-Platonic principles, Avicenna maintained the 
Aristotelian doctrine of sensation and the moderate realistic doctrine 
of universals. The latter he expressed in the formula so often quoted 
by Albert and other schoolmen: "Intellectus in formis agit 
universalitatem." His definition of the soul<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> is identical with 
Aristotle's: "Completa definitio animae est perfectio prima vel actus 
primus corporis organici." Still, he returns to Neo-Platonic principles 
in his account of the origin of intellectual knowledge, as when<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> he 
teaches that intelligible species are acquired in two ways: by 
rational discourse, or demonstration, and by infusion ("infusio vel 
manatio divina").<p>

Both St. Thomas and Albertus Magnus ascribe to Avicenna the doctrine of 
the unity and transcendency of the <i>active intellect</i>. The former 
says:<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> "Intellectum agentem ponit Avicenna quandam substantiam 
separatam,"<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> "Avicenna ponit quod intellectus agens est unus in 
omnibus, quamvis non intellectus possibilis."<p>

<i>Historical Position</i>. Avicenna was the first of the Arabians of 
the East to depart from the Neo-Platonic interpretation of Aristotle. 
The remnant of Neo-Platonism in his system of philosophy is proof of 
his inability to escape altogether from the influence of his 
predecessors. Averro&euml;s, who represents the Arabian philosophy of 
the West, looked upon Avicenna as a materialistic pantheist; Algazel 
and other mystics regarded him as a rationalist; and many of the 
schoolmen spoke of him as the first of the mediaeval Occasionalists.<p>

<b>Averro&euml;s</b> was born in the year 1126 at Cordova. His career, 
like that of Avicenna, shows the bitterness of the intolerance 
prevailing among the followers of Islam, inclined as they were to side 
with the mystics, whom they regarded as orthodox, rather than with the 
philosophers, whom they suspected of hostility to the Koran. Like 
Avicenna, too, he was a physician. Exiled to Morocco on account, it is 
said, of his political doctrines, he died there in the year 1198. 
Averro&euml;s was regarded as the greatest of all the Arabian commentators 
of Aristotle. He composed besides his commentaries several treatises on 
astronomy, medicine, and philosophy, and also a controversial work, 
<i>Destructio Destructionis</i>, in answer to Algazel's <i>Destructio 
Philosophorum</i>. His admiration for Aristotle knew no bounds. 
"Aristotelis doctrina," he says, "est summa veritas, quoniam ejus 
intellectus fuit finis humani intellectus."<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--
314 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p314"></a><p>

In <i>logic</i> Averro&euml;s limits himself to the task of commenting 
on Aristotle's <i>Organon</i>. He adopts Avicenna's formula, 
"Intellectus in formis agit universalitatem." Science, he teaches, 
treats of individual things under the form of universality which the 
intellect abstracts.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Metaphysics</i>. Matter and form are the principles of being. Matter 
is not to be conceived as identical with not-being. It is the eternal 
potency out of which the First Mover extracted (<i>extractio</i> is to 
be substituted for <i>creatio</i>) the successive forms, or forces, 
which determine matter to different modes of existence.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Heavenly bodies are endowed with a more excellent kind of form than are 
terrestrial bodies. The Prime Mover imparts motion to the celestial 
sphere, which in turn moves the planetary spheres. The mover of the 
sphere of the moon is the active intellect.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Psychology</i>. The most characteristic of Averro&euml;s' 
psychological doctrines is that of the unity of the active intellect. 
Whenever Aristotle speaks of the intellect as separate from matter or 
unmixed with matter, Averro&euml;s understands him to mean that the 
power by which the potentially intelligible is rendered actually 
intelligible is physically and topically separate from the body and is 
numerically one and common to all men. The passive intellect, which 
Averro&euml;s calls the material intellect, is also one: "Possumus 
opinari intellectum materialem esse unicum in cunctis individuis."<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> 
In the context of the passage just quoted, the active and passive 
intellects are called parts of the same intellect. Still, in a certain 
sense, it is true that there are as many intellects as there are 
individuals, for the separate intellect is communicated to the 
individual soul, just as the light, while remaining one, is 
communicated to the multiplicity of objects which it illuminates.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> 
This communication is described as continuatio or copulatio, and the 
schoolmen understood Averro&euml;s to mean that the continuation of the 
individual soul with the transcendent intellect takes place by means of 
the phantasmata of the sensitive soul.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup><p>

It is evident from this doctrine that, according to Averro&euml;s, the 
individual soul contains nothing superior to matter, and is, therefore, 
corruptible. The  
 <!--
JEWISH PHILOSOPHY 315 
 --><A NAME="p315"></a>
 impersonal intellect is immortal; but there is no personal 
immortality. Nevertheless, Averro&euml;s apparently believed in 
<i>personal</i> immortality. St. Thomas represents him as saying: "Per 
rationem concludo de necessitate quod intellectus est unus numero, 
firmiter tamen teneo oppositum per fidem."<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> The distinction to which 
allusion is made in this quotation was adopted by the Averroists of the 
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, when they maintained, in opposition 
to the fundamental principles of Scholasticism, that <i>what is true in 
philosophy may be false in theology</i>, and <i>vice versa</i>.<p>

<i>Historical Position</i>. Averro&euml;s was known as the commentator 
of Aristotle. He intended, no doubt, to reproduce as faithfully as he 
could the doctrines of the Stagirite. He did not, however, succeed in 
breaking with the pantheistic and rationalistic tradition of the 
Moorish schools; indeed, he emphasized in his commentaries those points 
of Aristotle's teaching which were opposed to Christian dogma, so that 
St. Thomas was obliged to judge him "non tam Peripateticus quam 
Peripateticae philosophiae depravator."<p>

JEWISH PHILOSOPHY<p>

<b>Authorities</b>. In addition to Munk's <i>M&eacute;langes</i> and 
Frank's <i>La Cabbale</i>, etc. (Paris, 1843), Max Doctor's <i>Die 
Philosophie des Josef (ben) Zaddik</i> (M&uuml;nster, 5895), Baeumker's 
edition of Avicebrol's <i>Fons Vitae</i> (M&uuml;nster, 1892), and 
Guttmann's <i>Die Scholastik des XIII Jahrh. in ihren Beziehungen sum 
Judentum</i> (Breslau, 1902) may be mentioned as authorities on the 
history of Jewish philosopby.<p>

The Jews, before their contact with Arabian civilization, developed a 
system of mystic philosophy based upon the cabalistic <i>Sephiroth</i>, or 
mystic numbers. It was, however, after they had come in contact with 
the Arabians in the East and in the Moorish kingdom, that Greek 
learning passed from the mosque to the synagogue, and the systems of 
philosophy were developed which influenced the course of Christian 
thought during the thirteenth century.<p>

<b>Avicebrol</b> (1020-1070) was born at Malaga. His real name was 
Salomon ben Gabirol, the name Avicebrol being the Latinized form of 
what was supposed to be an Arabian name. Indeed, it was only in recent 
times that the nationality of this philosopher was determined with 
certainty. His principal work, <i>Fons Vitae</i>, was probably composed 
in Arabic; Munk found a Hebrew copy of the work, and quite recently the 
Latin translation, made about the beginning of the twelfth century, has 
been published.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
316 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p316"></a><p>

Avicebrol's philosophy is a blending of Jewish religious doctrines with 
the doctrines of the Neo-Platonists. The importance attached to 
contemplation, and to a striving towards union with the divine, the 
doctrine of the pre&euml;xistence of the soul, of knowledge by means of 
reminiscence, of the eternity of matter, -- all these are evident 
signs of Neo-Platonic influence.<p>

The most characteristic of Avicebrol's tenets is the doctrine ascribed 
to him by Albertus Magnus<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> and St. Thomas,<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> that all things finite, 
whether corporeal or incorporeal, are composed of matter and form; that 
matter is, consequently, the <i>substratum of all finite 
existence</i>.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Gonz&aacute;lez<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup>calls attention to the similarity existing between 
Avicebrol's doctrine of universal matter and the doctrines of Duns 
Scotus regarding <i>materia primo-prima</i>. Indeed, all the first 
Franciscan masters maintained that matter is coextensive with finite 
being.<p>

<b>Moses Maimanides</b> (1135-1204), who was born at Cordova in 1135 
and died at Cairo in 1204, was the greatest of the Jewish 
Aristotelians. His philosophical treatise, entitled <i>Guide of the 
Doubting</i>, is an exposition of Aristotelian philosophy combined with 
Jewish religious teaching: "Intentio hujus libri," he says, "est docere 
sapientiam legis secundum veritatem et ex fundamentis."<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Moses departs from the teaching of Aristotle whenever he considers that 
Jewish dogma is opposed to Peripatetic philosophy. He maintains, for 
instance, that the world is not eternal, except in the sense that it 
proceeds by natural necessity from its cause which is eternal. He is 
willing, however, to grant that the eternity of the world is possible, 
although he does not agree with the Aristotelians who hold that it is 
necessary. In treating of the immortality of the soul, he cites 
passages from the Bible, quotes the opinions of the Greek and Arabian 
commentators, distinguishes between the soul that is born with us, and 
the intellect which is acquired, and ends by asserting that only the 
souls of the just are immortal.<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup> This doctrine of acquired immortality 
became one of the most distinctive doctrines of the Jewish school.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Although less original than Avicebrol, 
Maimonides was destined to exercise a more profound influence on 
succeeding generations of philosophers. To him may be traced the 
scientific movement which manifested itself among the Jews of the 
thirteenth and the two following centuries, and he is commonly regarded 
as the one who, of all the Jewish thinkers, contributed most to the 
system of Spinoza.  
 <!--
INFLUENCE OF JEWISH AND ARABIAN PHILOSOPHY 317  
 --><A NAME="p317"></a><p>

<i>Anonymous Works</i>. There were three works of doubtful authorship, 
which, on being translated from Arabic into Latin, became for the 
schoolmen common sources of information concerning Arabian, Jewish, and 
even Greek philosophy: (1) The <i>Secretum Secretorum</i>, a scientific 
miscellany, attributed to Aristotle; (2) <i>Theologia Aristotelis</i>, 
or <i>De Secretiori AEgyptiorum Philosophia</i>, which was sometimes 
attributed to Aristotle, but which is in reality a collection of 
excerpts from the <i>Enneades</i> of Plotinus; (3) <i>Liber de 
Causis</i>, which, under various titles, was ascribed to Aristotle, to 
St. Augustine, to Avempace, and to Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e. 
Albertus Magnus and St. Thomas decided against its Aristotelian 
authorship, the former ascribing it to a certain Jew named David, the 
latter judging it to be an Arabian compilation of a work by 
Proclus.<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> 
The preponderance of evidence is in favor of St. Thomas' opinion.<p> 

INFLUENCE OF ARABIAN AND JEWISH PHILOSOPHY ON SCHOLASTICISM<p>

The influence which Arabian and Jewish learning exercised on the 
schoolmen of the thirteenth century was very great. It was the Arabians 
and Jews who gave the first impulse to the study of the physical and 
metaphysical works of Aristotle. We must not, however, exaggerate the 
debt which Christian philosophy owes to the Arabians and Jews; we must 
remember that:<p>

1. Although the first translations which brought Greek philosophy 
within the reach of the schoolmen were made from the Arabic, these, as 
we shall see, were soon followed by the more accurate translations made 
from the Greek.<p>

2. If Christian Europe owes its knowledge of Aristotle to the Arabians, 
the Arabians themselves owe their knowledge of Aristotle to the 
Christian scholars of Syria.<p>

3. Although the Arabians contributed largely to the growth and 
development of the study of medicine in Europe, and although their 
contributions to mediaeval geography, astronomy, arithmetic, and 
chemistry were also important, yet in philosophy they 
 <!--
318 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p318"></a>
 exercised only an indirect influence. They provoked discussion and 
controversy; but to their direct influence not a single important tenet 
of Scholasticism can be traced.<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> The Scholastic movement was a 
creation of the Christian mind; Arabian philosophy was always
 anti-Christian in spirit and teaching. The impulse that made 
Scholasticism originated with the Carolingian renaissance. The movement 
was continued by Erigena, Gerbert, Roscelin, Anselm, and other 
Christian thinkers; and received new force from the introduction of the 
physical and metaphysical works of Aristotle. Scholastic philosophy 
owes nothing to the Arabians except what they contributed to the 
introduction of these works.<p>

The influence of the Jews was more important than that of the Arabians. 
The Jews of Moorish Spain enjoyed a large, measure of liberty, and 
among them philosophy found a home when Arabian philosophers were 
persecuted and their works consigned to the flames. Among the Jews and 
in the Jewish schools the works of the Greeks and of the Arabians were 
preserved, translated into Hebrew, and handed over to the Christian 
scholars, who in turn translated them into Latin. In this way the 
influence of the Arabians, restricted as it was, was chiefly exercised 
through the literature and philosophy of the Jews.<p>
