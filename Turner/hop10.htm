THE PLATONIC SCHOOLS</h3><p>

The <i>Laws</i>, which, according to the most probable opinion, was 
written by Plato, though it was not made public until after his death, 
bears evidence of the influence which, in the later years of his life, 
the philosophy of the Pythagoreans exercised on his mind, inclining him 
to attach more and more importance to the <i>mystic element</i> in 
philosophy and to the <i>number theory</i>. It was this phase of 
Platonic thought that was taken up and developed by the Platonic 
Academies, while in the bands of Aristotle the teachings of the earlier 
dialogues were carried to a higher development. During the lifetime of 
Plato there was little, if any, dissension among the members of the 
school which assembled in the grove of Academus; after Plato's death, 
however, Aristotle set up a school of his own, in opposition to the 
members of the Academy, who claimed to possess in their scholarch the 
authorized head of the Platonic school.<p>

The first scholarch was Speusippus, the nephew of Plato, who, according 
to Diogenes Laertius,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> received his appointment from Plato himself. 
He in turn was succeeded by Xenocrates,<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> and in this manner the 
succession of scholarchs continued down to the sixth century of the 
Christian era.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

It is customary to distinguish in the history of the Platonic school 
three periods, known as the <i>Old</i>, the <i>Middle</i>, and the 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p122"></a>
 <i>New Academy</i>. To the <i>Old Academy</i> belonged <i>Speusippus, 
Xenoerates, Heraclides</i> of Pontus, <i>Philip</i> of Opus, 
<i>Crates</i>, and <i>Crantor</i>; <i>Arcesilaus</i> and 
<i>Carneades</i> are the principal representatives of the <i>Middle 
Academy</i>, while <i>Philo</i> of Larissa and <i>Antiochus</i> of 
Ascalon are the best-known members of the New Academy.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Our sources of information concerning the history of 
the doctrines of the three Academies are for the most part secondary; 
they are scanty and cannot be relied upon in matters of detail. As far, 
however, as a general characterization of each school is concerned, our 
materials are sufficiently ample and trustworthy.<p>

<b>Old Academy</b>. The Old Academy flourished from the death of Plato 
(347 B.C.) until the appearance of Arcesilaus as scholarch (about 250 
B.C.). It is distinguished by its interpretation of the Platonic theory 
of Ideas in accordance with the <i>number theory of the Pythagoreans</i>.<p>

<b>Speusippus</b> seems to have <i>substituted numbers for Ideas</i>, 
assigning to them all the attributes, including separate existence, 
which Plato in his earlier dialogues had attributed to the Ideas.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> 
Although, according to Theophrastus, Speusippus devoted but little 
attention to the study of the natural sciences, on one important point 
of physical doctrine he differed from Plato, maintaining, if we are to 
believe our Neo-Pythagorean authorities, that the elements are five, 
not four, and deriving these five, after the manner of Philolaus, from 
the five regular figures.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> If, as is probable, Aristotle, in 
<i>Analytica Posteriora</i>, II, 13, 97 a, 6, is speaking of 
Speusippus, the latter maintained that in order to know anything we 
must know everything.<p>

<b>Xenocrates</b> continued to combine, as Speusippus had done, the number 
theory of the Pythagoreans with Plato's doctrine of Ideas. He went 
farther, however, than Speusippus in his application of number to 
theological notions, developing a 
 <!--
OLD AND MIDDLE ACADEMIES 123 
 --><A NAME="p123"></a>
 system of demonology which suggests in its elaborateness the doctrines 
of the Neo-Platonists.<p>

<b>Heraclides</b> of Pontus is remarkable for having taught the diurnal 
<i>revolution of the earth</i> on its axis, and the immobility of the 
fixed stars. These views were first proposed by Hicetas of Sicily and 
by Ecphantus, who was also a Sicilian. Our authorities are 
Theophrastus<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> and Plutarch.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Philip</b> of Opus is generally believed to be the author of 
<i>Epinomis</i> and the editor of the <i>Laws</i>, of which the 
<i>Epinomis</i> is a continuation.<p>

<b>Crates</b> and <b>Crantor</b> devoted themselves mainly to the study 
of ethical problems.<p>

<b>Middle Academy</b>. The Middle Academy was "characterized by an 
ever-increasing tendency to scepticism." Chronologically, it belongs to 
the third period of Greek philosophy, and in its spirit and contents it 
is more in keeping with the post-Aristotelian age than with the time of 
Plato and Aristotle.<p>

<b>Arcesilaus</b>, who was born about 315 B.C., is regarded as the 
founder of the Middle Academy. He combated the dogmatism of the Stoics, 
maintaining that as, according to the Stoics, the criterion of truth is 
perception, and as a false perception may be as irresistible as a true 
one, all scientific knowledge is impossible. It is, therefore, he 
concluded, the duty of a wise man to refrain from giving his assent to 
any proposition, -- an attitude of mind which the Academicians called 
<i>forbearance</i> (<b>apoche</b>). Still, Arcesilaus would grant that 
a degree of probability sufficient for intelligent action is 
possible.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Carneades</b> lived from about 210 to 129 B.C. Consequently, he was 
not the immediate successor of Arcesilaus, whose principles he 
developed into a more pronounced system of Scepticism. He held that 
there is no criterion of truth; that what we take to 
 <!--
124 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p124"></a>
 be true is only the appearance of truth,  -- <b>phainomenon 
al&ecirc;thes</b> which Cicero renders <i>probabile visum</i>.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>New Academy</b>. After the death of Carneades, the Academy abandoned 
Scepticism and returned to the dogmatism of its founder.<p>

<b>Philo</b> of Larissa and <b>Antiochus</b> of Ascalon introduced into 
the Academy elements of Stoicism and Neo-Platonism which belong to the 
third period of Greek philosophy.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The Academics, although they were the 
official representatives of Platonic philosophy, failed to grasp the 
true meaning of the theory of Ideas. By introducing Pythagorean and 
other elements they turned the tradition of the Platonic school out of 
the line of its natural development, and ended in adopting a scepticism 
or a dogmatic eclecticism, either of which is far from what should have 
been the logical outcome of Plato's teaching. They are to Plato what 
the imperfectly Socratic schools are to Socrates. The continuity, 
therefore, of Platonic thought is not to be looked for in these schools 
but rather in the school founded by Aristotle.<p>
