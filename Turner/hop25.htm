JOHN SCOTUS ERIGENA</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. John Scotus Erigena, or Ierugena, was born between the 
years 800 and 815. Ireland was probably the place of his birth.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> About 
the middle of the ninth century he appeared at the court of Charles the 
Bald, by whom he was placed at the head of the palace school. He was 
ordered by his royal patron to translate the writings of
 Pseudo-Dionysius and of  
 <!--
JOHN SCOTUS ERIGENA 247  
 --><A NAME="p247"></a>
 Maximus Confessor. He is said to have gone to Oxford at the invitation 
of Alfred the Great, and to have founded a school at Malmesbury, where, 
according to a tradition by no means reliable, he was put to death by 
his scholars. These biographical data are, with the exception of his 
relations with Charles and with the palace school, matters of great 
uncertainty. There are many reasons for supposing that Erigena was a 
layman, although St&ouml;ckl believes that he was probably a priest.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Erigena composed, besides the translations of
 Pseudo-Dionysius and Maximus Confessor, a comprehensive philosophical 
work, <i>De Divisione Naturae</i>, and a treatise, <i>De Egressu et 
Regressu Animae ad Deum</i>, of which only a fragment has come down to 
us. To the predestination controversy which was waged in the ninth 
century between <b>Gottschalk, Ratramnus</b>, and <b>Servatus 
Lupus</b>, on the one hand, and <b>Hincmar, Florus</b>, and 
<b>Remi</b>, archbishop of Rheims, on the other, Erigena contributed a 
treatise, <i>De Praedestinatione</i>, which seems to have given offense 
to both parties. In the other great controversy of the ninth and the 
following centuries, the dispute concerning the doctrine of 
transubstantiation, in which <b>Ratramnus</b> and <b>Berengar</b> were 
opposed by <b>Paschasius Radbertus</b> and <b>Lanfranc</b>, Erigena 
also took an active part. The work, however, <i>De Corpore et Sanguine 
Domini</i>, which has been ascribed to him, is undoubtedly to be assigned 
to some other writer of the ninth century, very probably to 
Ratramnus.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Of considerable importance in determining the philosophical views of 
Erigena are his <i>Expositiones</i>, -- commentaries on the works of 
Pseudo-Dionysius, -- and the commentary on Martianus Capella, fragments 
of which were published by Haur&eacute;au.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> The commentary on the 
gospel of St. John and the <i>Homilia in Prolegomenon Evangelii sec. 
Joannem</i> are  Erigena's contributions to scriptural exegesis.<p>

The works of Erigena as published by Dr. Floss are reprinted in Migne's 
<i>Patrologia Latina</i>, Vol. CXXII. The <i>De Divisione Naturae</i> 
was first published by Gale (Oxford, 1681). A recent addition to our 
secondary sources is Alice Gardner's <i>John the Scot</i> (London, 1900).<p>

ERIGENA'S PHILOSOPHY<p>

<b>General Idea of Erigena's Philosophy</b>. In its general outlines 
the philosophy of Erigena is Dionysian, that is to say Neo-Platonic. 
Erigena carries the union of philosophy and theology 
 <!--
248 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p248"></a>
 to the point of identifying the two sciences. In his work <i>De 
Praedestinatione</i> he quotes St. Augustine as saying:<p>

<blockuote>
Non aliam esse philosophiam, id est sapientiae studium, et aliam 
religionem, cum ii quorum doctrinam non approbamus nec sacramenta 
nobiscum communicant.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> 
</blodkquote>
  
But while Augustine evidently means merely that the speculative aspect 
of religion is as important as the practical, Erigena understands him 
to mean that philosophy and religion are one and the same; for he 
continues:<p>

<blockquote>
Quid est aliud de philosophia tractare nisi verae religionis, qua summa 
et principalis omnium rerum causa, Deus, et humiliter colitur et 
rationabiliter investigatur, regulas exponere? Conficitur inde veram 
esse philosophiam veram religionem, conversimque veram religionem esse 
veram philosophiam.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

We have here the characteristic trait of Scholasticism, though in an 
exaggerated form, -- the attempt, namely, to find a rational basis 
for the union of reason and revelation. Later on the great masters of 
Scholasticism, while recognizing the union of reason and revelation, 
will allot to philosophy a sphere of its own, maintaining that faith 
and science are distinct though perfectly accordant with each other. 
Thus, St. Thomas would not subscribe to Erigena's methodological 
principle that the Scripture and the Fathers are sources of proof in 
philosophy.<p>

The <i>identification of philosophy with theology</i> by Erigena is not 
to be understood as an advocacy of rationalism. It is true that Erigena 
maintains the priority of reason with respect to authority, as when he 
says, "Omnis auctoritas quae vera ratione non approbatur infirma esse 
videtur."<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> But this is a principle common to all the Scholastics. Far 
from being a rationalist Erigena is more inclined to take sides with 
the mystics, -- to belittle all reason unless in so far as reason is 
illumined from on  
 <!--
ERIGENA'S METAPHYSICS 249 
 --><A NAME="p249"></a>
 high. Instead of rationalizing theology, he would theosophize 
philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Erigena assigns to philosophy <i>a fourfold task</i>: to diyjde, to 
define, to demonstrate, and to analyze (<i>resolutiva</i>).<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> This may 
be described as Erigena's definition of the applicability of dialectic 
to philosophy and theology, -- a notion which, like that of the union 
of faith and science, is destined to develop in the subsequent growth 
of Scholastic philosophy.<p>

<b>General Metaphysical Doctrines</b>. The treatise <i>De Divisione 
Naturae</i> begins with the definition of nature. Nature is "quidquid 
vel animo percipi potest vel animi intentionem superat." Nature is 
therefore synonymous with being. The first great division of nature is 
into things <i>which are</i> and things <i>which are not</i>. Now, 
there are five ways in which a thing may be said <i>not to be</i>:<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup><p>

1. A thing is not in the sense that it <i>cannot be known</i>. "Quae 
per excellentiam suae naturae omnem sensum, intellectum rationemque 
fugiunt, jure videri non esse." In this sense God and the essences of 
things are non-existent.<p>

2. A thing is not, <i>relatively to something else</i>, in the sense 
that, being what it is, it is not that which is higher. "Inferioris 
affirmatio superioris est negatio: inferioris negatio est superioris 
affirmatio." Thus, a plant is not, because it is not an animal, and in 
like manner every being is relatively not-being.<p>

3. A thing is not when it is in mere <i>potency</i>. "Quae vero adhuc 
in naturae sinibus continentur nec in formata materia apparent . . . 
dicimus non esse.' Erigena adduces the example of the human race 
potentially constituted by God in the first man.<p>

4. A thing is not <i>in refrrence to the intellect</i>, when it is 
enveloped, as it were, in material conditions. "Quae locorum  
 <!-- 
250 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p250"></a>
 spatiis temporumque notibus variantur, colliguntur, solvuntur, vere 
dicuntur non esse."<p>

5. Finally, there is a mode of not-being which is peculiar to man. 
Man's being is the imaged beauty and holiness of God. When, by sin, he 
loses this dignity, destroying the image of God which is in him, man 
ceases to exist: he is not.<p>

Leaving this fivefold enumeration of the modes of not-being, we come to 
the celebrated division of nature into (1) <i>Natura quae creat et non 
creatur</i>; (2) <i>Natura quae creatur et creat</i>; (3) <i>Natura 
quae creatur et non creat</i>; and (4) <i>Natura quae nec creatur nec 
creat</i>.<p>

1. <i>Natura quae creat et non creatur</i> is God, the origin, 
principle, and source of all things. True to the tenets of the 
Dionysian philosophy, Erigena denies that God can know Himself. God is 
incomprehensible to Himself as He is to us. For, to know Himself, He 
should place Himself in one of the categories of thought, and that is 
impossible.<p>

In discussing the possibility of our knowing God, Erigena dwells on the 
twofold theory of <i>theological predication</i>. There is the 
<i>affirmative</i> theory, which says that substance, goodness, and so 
forth may be affirmed of God; and there is the <i>negative</i> theory, 
which maintains that all these predicates should be denied. The truth, 
according to Erigena, is that these predicates may be affirmed of the 
Supreme Being if they are taken in a metaphorical sense; in their 
proper, or literal, meaning they must be denied, because God is <i>more 
than substance, more than goodness</i>. Thus, though in speech we 
affirm these and other predicates, in thought we deny them: "in 
pronunciatione est forma <b>kataphatik&ecirc;</b>, in intellectu autem 
<b>apophatik&ecirc;</b>."<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> It is remarkable how much the first and 
most daring of the schoolmen is willing to concede to agnosticism.<p>

What is said of predicates of God in general is true also of the term 
Creator. God and the action by which He made things
 <!--
ERIGENA'S PANTHEISM 251 
 --><A NAME="p251"></a>
 are one. When, therefore, we say that God is Creator, we mean, 
according to Erigena, that He is more than Creator, that He is in all 
things as their sole substance.<p>

<blockquote>
Cum ergo audimus Deum omnia facere nil aliud debemus intelligere quam 
Deum in omnibus esse, hoc est, essentiam omnium subsistere. Ipse enim 
solus per se vere est, et omne quod vere in his quae sunt dicitur esse 
ipse solus est.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

This <i>pantheism</i> is professed over and over again, as, for 
example, "Deus namque omnium essentia est, quia solus vere est,"<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> and 
the oft-quoted formula of Pseudo-Dionysius, "Esse omnium est superesse 
Divinitatis." It is true that Engena sometimes speaks of God as 
separate from creatures: "Ipse Deus in se ipso ultra omnem creaturam 
nullo intellectu comprehenditur"; and again, "Deus non est totum 
creaturae, neque creatura pars Dei."<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> Nevertheless, we cannot, 
without accusing Erigena of self-contradiction, attach any 
philosophical value to these expressions; they are merely the 
incidental use of common modes of speech. For Erigena certainly 
maintained that the being of creatures is the being of God, and that by 
creation God becomes His creatures. This consideration leads to the 
next division.<p>

2. <i>Natura quae creatur et creat</i>. By this our philosopher 
understands God as containing in the Word (Logos) the <i>primordial 
causes, or types</i>, of things, formed before all creation.<p>

<blockquote>
Pater, i.e., omnium principium, in Verbo suo, Unigenito videlicit 
Filio, omnium rerum rationes quas faciendas esse voluit priusquam res 
fierent praeformavit.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> 
</blockquote><p>

There is no hierarchy among these types as there was among the Platonic 
Ideas; still, Erigena, following Pseudo-Dionysius, enumerates ten first 
primordial causes.<p>

These types are in God. Consequently, they are intelligent, 
understanding themselves and understanding the things of which
 <!--
252 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p252"></a>
 they are types. They are indeed made, but made from all eternity; for 
they are coeternal with God. Of this coeternity, however, Erigena is 
not altogether certain. The primordial causes proceeded from the Father 
by a process which is figuratively described as a <i>flowing</i>.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup><p>

We must be careful not to conclude too hastily, as has sometimes been 
done, that Erigena identified the primordial causes -- the world of 
Ideas -- with the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity. The Son is 
begotten from all eternity. From all eternity, too, the primordial 
causes were made; they are in the Son, of the same substance as the 
Father, yet, as the defenders of Erigena have conclusively shown, they 
are not the Son.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Here, as well as in his treatment of the first division of nature, 
Erigena's pantheism is apparent. He maintains that by the emanation, or 
flowing, of the ideas from God, the divine nature creates itself. 
"Creatur enim a seipsa in primordialibus causis ac per hoc seipsam 
creat."<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> He goes on, however, to explain that the creation in this 
case consists in a showing forth (<i>theophania</i>) of the divine nature.<p>

3. <i>Natura quae creatur et non creat</i> means the world of 
phenomena, things subject to change and to the conditions of time and 
space: "quae in generatione temporibusque et locis cognoscuntur, hoc est 
in primordialium causarum effectibus extremis."<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> Individual things -- 
creatures, as we call them -- are derived from God; they participate in 
the divine nature, for all derivation is participation. Now, the order 
of derivation is from the Father to the primordial causes, and from 
these to concrete individual existences. In the Word, which is the 
locus of the primordial causes, all things are in a condition of 
comparative undifferentiation; but when they issue forth from the Word 
to  
 <!--
ERIGENA'S DOCTRINE OF FINAL RETURN 253 
 --><A NAME="p253"></a>
 become the complex world of concrete things, they suffer separation, 
differentiation, and multiplicity. Our philosopher illustrates his 
thought by referring to the radii of a circle: at the center all the 
radii are united, but as they proceed towards the circumference they 
become distinct and separate.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> The separation of the primordial causes 
is the work of the Holy Spirit, -- of the Spirit who in the beginning 
moved over the face of the waters.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The derivation of things proceeded in definite order through the 
highest genera, lower genera, intermediate species, and special species 
to the individual. Thus did Erigena hypostatize, as it were, the 
categories and lay down the principle of the most rigorous realism, --  
that the categories of Thought and Being exist outside the mind in all 
their universality.<p>

We may, then, describe the process of the origin of things as an 
emanation, or flowing, from the first principle of existence. Erigena 
calls the process a <i>theophania</i>, or showing forth of the divine 
nature; and it is in this sense that the supreme principle of existence 
pervades or runs through all nature; for <b>theos</b> is derived from 
<b>the&ocirc;</b> (to run). Creation, in the common acceptation of the 
term, does not apply to the origin of things; yet, since God made all 
things out of His own substance, and since, in the meaning already 
described, He is non-existent, He may be said to have made all things 
ex nihilo.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup><p>

4. The fourth division of nature is <i>Natura quae nec creatur nec 
creat</i>. This is <i>God as the end of all things</i>, the goal to 
which all created beings must return. Everywhere in the universe 
Erigena finds traces or signs of the final return of creatures to the 
Creator. The heavenly sphere is constantly returning to the point where 
it was twenty-four hours previously; in four years the sun completes 
its course in the celestial circle, returning to the point whence it 
started; there is a period set for the return of the flowers and leaves 
and herbs. And so all creatures at the completion of the cosmic cycle 
will 
 <!--
254 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p254"></a>
 return to the Principle whence they came. This is especially true of 
man; for the life of man on earth is but a striving after the true, the 
beautiful, the good, the perfect, from which he came, and to which he 
must return ere he can find rest.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> God, who revealed Himself in 
creation, will retire within Himself in the final <b>apokatastasis</b>, 
or universal return of creature to Creator.<p>

Just as creatures emanated from God according to definite order, so 
shall they return to Him in order, the lower through the higher. As air 
is changed into light and metal into fire, so shall bodily substance be 
changed into soul; and, in like manner, whatever is inferior shall rise 
through higher forms to God.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> This doctrine of Erigena on the one hand 
reminds us of the Heraclitean doctrine of the upward and downward way, 
and on the other hand suggests the Hegelian theory of divine processes.<p>

<b>Problem of Universals</b>. Although the problem of universals was 
not proposed to the Scholastics of Erigena's day, our philosopher 
treats incidentally of the existence of the categories, and, placing 
himself on the side of the extreme realists, affirms the objective 
reality of the highest genera as well as of the individual. Indeed, he 
goes farther than the Platonic realists, when, not content with 
affirming the logical unity of the concept of Being, he attributes to 
Being objective or ontological unity, affirming that Being is one.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Erigena's Psychological Doctrines</b> do not occupy an important 
place in his system of thought. He divides the cognitive powers of the 
mind into sensible and supersensible. The sense-faculty is one, the
 so-called five senses being merely the different organs which the 
sense employs.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> The higher, or supersensible, faculties are 
threefold, imaging the Trinity: the first is <i>intellect</i> 
(<b>nous</b>), by which the mind contemplates God, the source and 
author of all things; the second is <i>reason</i> (<b>logos</b>), by 
 <!--
ERIGENA'S ANTHROPOLOGICAL DOCTRINES 255 
 --><A NAME="p255"></a>
 which the mind contemplates the primordial causes in the Word; the 
third is <i>internal sense</i> (<b>dianoia</b>), by which the mind 
attains a knowledge of the world of phenomena: "circa effectus causarum 
primordialium, sive visibiles sive invisibiles sint, 
circumvolvitur."<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> Now, while these three are merely phases of the 
soul, the first is properly the essential nature of the soul, the 
second is a power (<b>dunamis</b>), and the third is a kind of 
<b>energeia</b>, or actuality of the soul. The evolution, or march, of 
knowledge is twofold: <i>from the higher to the lower</i>, that is, 
from an intuitive knowledge of God (<i>gnostico intuitu</i>) to a 
knowledge of primordial causes, and thence to a knowledge of concrete 
things; and <i>from the lower to the higher</i>, that is from
 sense-experience to the internal sense which abstracts the specific 
and generic concepts, and thence through a knowledge of primordial 
causes to a knowledge of God Himself. The descending march of knowledge 
corresponds to the origin of things from God; the ascending march 
corresponds to the return of things to God. Thus, in his theory of 
knowledge Erigena is inclined to admit Aristotelian as well as
 Neo-Platonic principles. He is, however, in final analysis a
 Neo-Platonist, for he teaches that the knowledge which most avails is 
knowledge of which the origin and starting-point is God Himself.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup><p>

With regard to <i>self-knowledge</i>, the soul can know its own 
<i>existence</i> but not its <i>essence</i>. And herein the soul is 
most like to God, for of God we can know merely <i>that</i> He is, not 
<i>what</i> He is.<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> The reason adduced in proof of the soul's 
inability to know itself is interesting. A definition, our philosopher 
argues, is a place; but the containing is greater than the contained. 
If, therefore, the soul could define itself, it should be greater than 
itself, which is manifestly absurd.<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Anthropological Doctrines</b>. Man is composed of body and soul: 
"Homo autem corpus et anima est."<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup> The soul is a simple 
 <!--
256 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p256"></a>
 spiritual substance: it is the principle of life. Moreover, <i>the soul 
creates the body</i>.<p>

<blockquote>
Anima corpus suum ipsa creat non tamen de nihilo sed de aliquo. Anima 
namque incorporales qualitates in unum conglutinante, et quasi quoddam 
subjectum ipsis qualitatibus ex quantitate sumente, et supponente, 
corpus sibi creat?<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

The essence of the soul, as we have seen, is intellect. Its essential 
nature includes will also: "Tota animae natura voluntas est."<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> In fact, 
will and intellect are indissolubly associated: "Ubi rationabilitas ibi 
necessario libertas."<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In <i>the first man</i>, who was created in a state of happiness and 
lived a life like to that of the angels, were contained <i>in sola 
possibilitate</i> all his successors. "Simul ac semel in illo uno 
homine omnium hominum rationes secundum corpus et animam creatae 
sunt."<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup> This postulate being granted, it was easy for Erigena to 
explain the transmission of original sin.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. When we come to form an estimate of Erigena 
as a philosopher, we must not allow his many brilliant qualities to 
blind us as to the enormity of his errors. He was, without doubt, the 
most learned man of his century, he was the first of the 
representatives of the new learning to attempt a system of constructive 
thought, and he brought to his task a truly Celtic wealth of 
imagination and a spiritual force which lifted him above the plane of 
his contemporaries, -- mere epitomizers and commentators. His 
philosophy has all the charm which pantheism always possesses for a 
certain class of minds. It is subtle, vague, and poetic. When we come 
to examine its contents and method, we find that it is dominated by the 
spirit of Neo-Platonism. Through the works of Pseudo-Dionysius and of 
Maximus, Erigena made acquaintance with the teachings of Plotinus and 
Proclus; and when he came to construct his own system of thought, he 
reproduced the essential traits of 
 <!--
GERBERT 257 
 --><A NAME="p257"></a>
 Neo-Platonic philosophy, -- pantheism, the doctrine of intuition, 
mysticism, and universal redemption.<p>

The work <i>De Divisione Naturae</i> was condemned in 1225. Its 
heterodoxy is undeniable; yet we cannot doubt the sincerity of 
Erigena's devotion to the truth of Catholic dogma. He was, as 
Anastasius the Roman librarian described him, "vir per omnia sanctus." 
Perhaps his attitude towards dogmatic truth is best described in the 
words of Gale, who first published the <i>De Divisione Naturae</i>: 
"Potuit ergo errare; haereticus esse noluit."<p>

Erigena illustrates the many-sidedness of the Scholastic movement. To 
classify as anti-Scholastic whatever does not agree with the synthetic 
systems of the great masters of Scholasticism is to break the line of 
continuous historical development which led through the failures and 
partial successes of Erigena, Abelard, and other philosophers to the 
philosophy of the thirteenth century. Scholasticism in its final form 
is the outcome of the forces of Christian civilization which, in 
different conditions and in less favorable circumstances, produced the 
imperfect Scholasticism of the period of beginnings and the period of 
growth.<p>
