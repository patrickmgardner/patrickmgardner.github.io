THE ENGLISH ASSOCIATION SCHOOL 613  
 --><A NAME="p613"></a>
<h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXIX<br>
ENGLISH PHILOSOPHY</h3><p>

Contemporaneously with the deistic and the general empirical movement 
of the eighteenth century there arose in England the school of 
associational psychology and utilitarian ethics, which dominated 
English thought during the greater part of the nineteenth century.<p>

<b>Associational Psychology</b>.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> The physician <b>David Hartley</b> 
(1705-1757) is regarded as the founder of the association school of 
psychology. He reduces all mental phenomena to the sensation and 
association of vibrations of the white medullary substance of the brain 
and spinal cord. He does not, however, identify the brain with the 
thinking substance, or soul; for vibrations merely affect the body, the 
sensation of vibrations affecting the soul. Sensations on being 
repeated leave traces which are simple ideas. Simple ideas are, by 
association, amalgamated into complex ideas. Similarly, assent and 
belief are to be explained by association. Hartley protests against the 
materialistic identification of soul with body; he maintains that there 
is a correspondence between cerebral and psychical processes, but 
contends that the latter cannot be reduced to the former.<p>

<b>Joseph Priestley</b> (1733-1804), theologian, philosopher, chemist, 
and physicist, brought out the materialism which was latent in 
Hartley's psychology. He teaches that the soul is material, that 
thought is a function of the brain, and that psychology is merely the 
physics of the nerves. He maintains, however, that psychological 
materialism does not imply the denial of the immortality of the soul or 
of the existence of God.<p>

Priestley is best known by his great contribution to chemical science, 
-- the discovery of oxygen (1774).  
 <!--
614 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p614"></a><p>

<b>Erasmus Darwin</b> (1731-1802), who was a botanist, philosopher, and 
poet, is reckoned among the associationists of this period. In his 
Zoonomia, or the Laws of Organic Life (London, 1794-1796), he teaches 
that nature is made up of two substances: matter, which produces 
motion, and spirit, which receives and communicates motion. He teaches 
further that motion is of three kinds, gravitation, chemistry, and 
life. To the last-named kind of motion belong ideas, which are defined 
as "contractions, motions, or configurations of the fibers which 
constitute the immediate organs of sense." All the complex phenomena of 
mental life, namely sensation, comparison, judgment, reasoning, 
volition, are explained by the association of ideas which come to us 
not singly but in companies or tribes.<p>

This associational psychology necessitates the utilitarian view of 
human conduct, -- the view, namely, that certain actions are to be 
performed mainly or primarily because they are means to our enjoyment. 
This principle was developed into a system of ethics by Jeremy Bentham.<p>

<b>Utilitarian Ethics</b>.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> The founder of modern English 
utilitarianism is <b>Jeremy Bentham</b> (1748-1832). In his 
<i>Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation</i> (1789) 
and in his <i>Deontology</i> (1834) he formulates the principle that 
the end of morality is "the greatest happiness of the greatest number." 
Utility means the power of an action to produce happiness. Bentham's 
system has consequently been described by J. S. Mill as 
utilitarianism.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> In ultimate analysis it is hedonism; for it teaches 
that "every virtuous action results in a balance of pleasure." It is, 
however, a hedonism which unites altruism with egoism; for it maintains 
that while each one's primary care should be for his own welfare, the 
interest of the individual is inseparable from  
 <!--
JOHN STUART MILL 615
 --><A NAME="p615"></a>
 that of the community. The determinants of utility are, according to 
Bentham, the act, the circumstances, the intention and the 
consciousness, all of which should be taken into account in the 
estimation of the moral value of an action. All virtue he reduces to 
two kinds, prudence and benevolence.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Revived Associationalism and Utilitarianism</b>. The most important 
of Bentham's co-workers was <b>James Mill</b> (1773-1836), author of 
the <i>Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind</i> (1829).<p>

In psychology James Mill combines the doctrines of Hartley with those 
of Hume, teaching that sensations are kinds of feeling, and that ideas 
are what remains after the sensations have disappeared. He was the 
first to formulate the doctrine of inseparable association, by which he 
explains belief of every kind, -- belief in events, belief in testimony, 
and belief in (assent to) the truth of propositions. Similarly, by 
means of association, he explains the phenomena of volitional and 
emotional life.<p>

In ethics James Mill reasserts Bentham's doctrine that moral value is 
identical with utility, and proceeds to give a more definite method of 
estimating moral worth. He distinguishes three successive stages in the 
evolution or education of the moral sentiments: namely, the association 
with certain actions of pleasure or pain, the association with certain 
actions of the pleasure or pain arising from the praise or blame of 
others, and finally, the association with certain actions of the idea 
of future praise or blame.<p>

JOHN STUART MILL<p>

<b>Life</b>. John Stuart Mill, son of James Mill, was born in London in 
1806. From 1823 to 1858 he was clerk and chief examiner of 
correspondence at the India House. The remainder of his life, with the 
exception of two years (1863-1868), during which he was member of 
Parliament, was spent at Avignon, where he died in 1873.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Mill's most important philosophical works are the 
<i>System of Logic</i> (1843), <i>Utilitarianism</i> (1863), and <i>An 
Examination of Sir William  
 <!--
616 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p616"></a>
 Hamilton's Philosophy</i> (1865). He contributed valuable essays and 
treatises to the literature of social and political philosophy and to 
the history of positivism. Consult Bain, <i>John Stuart Mill, a 
Criticism</i> (1882); Douglas, <i>John Stuart Mill</i> (Edinburgh, 
1895).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Logic</b>. Mill defines logic as the science of the operations of 
the understanding which are concerned in or subservient to the 
estimation of evidence; and evidence he defines as "that which the mind 
ought to yield to, not that which it does or must yield to."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> His 
logical inquiry includes, therefore, an investigation of the nature of 
mental assent, and an empirical analysis of intuition and belief, as 
well as of judgment and reasoning; so that in spite of Mill's frequent 
repudiation of the title of metaphysician, he is obliged in his 
<i>System of Logic</i> to take up the study of many of the fundamental 
problems of metaphysics. Thus, in the chapter entitled "Of the Things 
denoted by Names,"<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> he draws up the following <i>scheme of 
categories</i>: (1) <i>feelings, or states of consciousness</i>; (2) 
<i>minds which experience these feelings</i>; (3) <i>bodies which cause 
certain of these feelings</i>; and (4) <i>the successions, 
coexistences, likenesses, and unlikenesses between feelings or states 
of consciousness</i>. Having, however, resolved to make experience the 
sole source of knowledge, and to reject all <i>a priori</i>, or 
intuitive, knowledge, Mill is obliged to reduce <i>body</i> to "the 
permanent possibility of sensations," and <i>mind</i> to "the series of 
actual and possible states." He is aware of the difficulty incident to 
any phenomenalistic concept of mind; he cannot see how a series can be 
aware of itself as a series, and admits that "there is a bond of some 
sort among all the parts of the series which makes me say that they 
were feelings of a person who was the same person throughout, and this 
bond, to me, constitutes my ego."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--
JOHN STUART MILL 617 
 --><A NAME="p617"></a>
 Here Mill definitely abandons the associationist view of matter and 
mind, and practically admits a noumenal cause of sensations and a 
noumenal mind, thus opening, as some one has said, a trapdoor in the 
middle of his own philosophy.<p>

Insisting on the principle that we must make experience the test of 
experience, Mill maintains that the <i>fundamental axioms of logic and 
mathematics</i> are merely generalizations from experience, that the 
law of contradiction is simply a summing up of the experience which 
tells us of the incompatibility of belief and non-belief, and that the 
peculiar accuracy supposed to be characteristic of the first principles 
of geometry is hypothetical, that is to say, fictitious.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> The <i>law 
of causation</i> is likewise a generalization from experience; for 
causation is nothing but "invariable and unconditional sequence."<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Mill recognizes but one kind of <i>inference</i>, namely, inference 
<i>from particulars to particulars</i>. The syllogism he teaches is not 
a proof, for it involves <i>a petitio principii</i>: its function is to 
decipher or interpret the major premise which is a record of particular 
experiences, these experiences being the only evidence on which the 
conclusion rests.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Mill's most important contribution to logic is the formulation of the 
<i>rules and methods of experimental inquiry</i>. This is the most 
successful portion of his work, and it is this which has earned for him 
the title of the Aristotle of Inductive Logic. His success is, however, 
marred by his inability to give a satisfactory account of the basis of 
induction; the uniformity of nature, which he sets down as the ground 
of all induction, depends, according to him, on induction, and is not 
unconditionally certain.<p>

<b>Ethics</b>. In the opening chapters of the sixth book of the 
<i>Logic</i>, Mill endeavors to show that the doctrine of philosophical 
necessity does not imply that our actions are performed under 
compulsion, but merely that they follow the motive causes by a 
 <!--
618 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p618"></a>
 certain unconditional sequence which renders the scientific study of 
human nature possible.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Mill adopts the utilitarian doctrine that in the <i>effects</i> of an 
action, that is to say, in its power of promoting happiness, we possess 
a clear and natural standard by which to judge its moral worth. With 
Bentham he holds that the aim of human action should be the promotion 
of the <i>greatest happiness of all sentient beings</i>. He differs, 
however, from Bentham in his analysis of the moral feeling, in his 
addition of qualitative to quantitative distinction of pleasures, and, 
in general, in his attempt to bring utilitarianism into closer harmony 
with the requirements of subjective ethics. He is an altruist, whereas 
Bentham was, in ultimate analysis, an egoist.<p>

<b>Alexander Bain</b> (1818-1903), author of <i>Senses and 
Intellect</i> (third edition, 1868), <i>The Emotions and the Will</i> 
(third edition, 1875), <i>Mental and Moral Science</i> (third edition, 
1872), and <i>Mind and Body</i> (third edition, 1874), etc., is one of 
the most distinguished recent representatives of the English school of 
psychology. He avails himself of the aid which contemporary 
physiological science affords in the study of mental phenomena, and 
while he is commonly reckoned among the associationists, he seems to 
abandon the fundamental tenet of associationism, when he acknowledges 
similarity as the basis of all association of ideas.<p>

<b>Doctrine of Evolution</b>. Evolution, in the sense of a transition 
from the simpler to the more complex, from the lower to the higher 
forms of existence, is a concept almost as old as philosophy itself. 
The evolution of the physical universe from a primitive mass by a 
process of purely mechanical changes was implicitly contained in many 
of the ancient and in some modern systems of philosophy, notably in 
Descartes' and Kant's. The idea of development was applied to history 
by Herder (1744-1803), to astronomy by Laplace (1749-1827), to the 
zoological 
 <!--
DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION 619 
 --><A NAME="p619"></a>
 sciences by <b>Buffon</b> (1707-1788), <b>Lamarck</b> (1744-1829), and 
<b>Cuvier</b> (1769-1832), to anatomy and embryology by <b>Wolff</b> 
(1733-1794) and <b>Von Baer</b> (1792-1876), and to geology by 
<b>Lyell</b> (1797-1875). The history of evolution in the modern 
meaning of the word, namely that of the development of the sum of 
living beings from less perfect forms of existence, by means of natural 
causes, begins with the name of <b>Charles Darwin</b> (1809-1882), who 
was the first to establish the doctrine of development as a scientific 
theory in biology.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup><p>

As in the case of Newton, Galileo, and Copernicus, Darwin's scientific 
discoveries, while belonging to the history of natural science, are of 
interest in the history of philosophy because of the <i>new point of 
view</i> which they established. For, just as Newton had unified the 
whole physical universe by means of a single law, so Darwin unified the 
phenomena of the biological world under a single concept, and revealed 
the existence of continuity in a region where up to that time 
continuity had not been scientifically demonstrated; and just as Lyell 
had shown that the present state of the earth's surface is to be 
explained by the agency of natural causes, which are even now at work, 
so Darwin undertook to show that the flora and fauna of the earth 
originated by development, and that the agencies in the process of 
development were the same as those which are in operation at the 
present time.<p>

<i>Darwin's method</i> affords an interesting example of the use of 
inductive and accumulative argument. During his voyage on the Beagle 
(1831-1836) he began his observations on the fauna of South America, 
noting especially the geographical distribution of species and the 
similarity and difference existing between the present and preexisting 
forms. On his return to England  
 <!--
620 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p620"></a>
 <b>Malthus</b><sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> (1766-1834) <i>Essay on Population</i> suggested to 
him the idea of the <i>struggle for existence</i>. This may be regarded 
as his provisional hypothesis, to the verification of which he devoted 
twenty-one years preliminary to publishing his celebrated work, the 
<i>Origin of Species</i> (1859). The observations on which the process 
of verification is based may be reduced to (1) observations of the 
effect of artificial selection, (2) observations of the kinship 
existing between extinct species and species which are extant, (3) 
observations of the geographical distributions of animals, and (4) 
observations of the embryological development of animals. In the work 
entitled <i>The Descent of Man</i> (1871) Darwin applied the evolution 
theory to the origin of the human species. He was, however, willing to 
concede that there are what have since been called "gaps" in 
evolution; he confessed his inability to account for the origin of 
life, and always regarded the first beginning of variation as something 
mysterious.<p>

Darwin laid the foundation of modern <i>evolutionistic</i> ethics by 
referring the moral feeling to natural selection, or the struggle for 
existence, which fosters such qualities and faculties in the individual 
as confer the greatest benefit, not on the individual, but on the group 
or species.<p>

<b>A. R. Wallace</b> (born 1822), who shares with Darwin the honor of 
establishing the doctrine of natural selection, was more careful than 
Darwin to exclude from the general process of development the higher 
powers of the human mind, and to give a large scope to the operation of 
the teleological principle in the evolutionary process.<p>

<b>W. K. Clifford</b> (1845-1879), <b>John Tyndall</b> (1820-1893), 
<b>George J. Romanes</b> (1848-1894), and <b>Thomas Huxley</b>
 (1825-1895) are the most distinguished among those who applied the 
Darwinian doctrine to the different departments of natural science. It 
was the last mentioned who in 1859 first used the word <i>agnostic</i> 
to designate one who is conscious of the inadequacy of our knowledge to 
solve the problem, What is the reality corresponding to 
 <!--
HERBERT SPENCER 621 
 --><A NAME="p621"></a>
 our ultimate scientific, philosophical, and religious ideas? I None of 
these men, however, with the exception of Clifford, attempted to 
construct a system of metaphysics, or to evolve a theory of reality 
from the principles of evolutionistic philosophy. This task was 
reserved for Spencer.<p>

HERBERT SPENCER<p>

<b>Life</b>. Herbert Spencer<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> was born in 1820 at Derby. It was at 
first intended that he should adopt the profession of teacher, to which 
his father belonged; but he decided to take up civil engineering. At 
the age of twenty-five he abandoned this profession to devote himself 
to literary work. In 1850 appeared his first important publication, 
entitled <i>Social Statics</i>. This was followed by the <i>Principles 
of Psychology</i> (1855), and <i>Progress: its Law and Cause</i> 
(1857), in which, two years before the publication of Darwin's 
<i>Origin of Species</i>, the view was expounded that all development 
is a transition from homogeneity to heterogeneity, and the principle of 
evolution was enunciated as a universal law. The <i>First 
Principles</i> (1862), <i>Principles of Biology</i> (1863-1867), 
<i>Principles of Sociology</i> (1877 ff.), and <i>Principles of 
Ethics</i> (1879-1893) form parts of a scheme of <i>Synthetic 
Philosophy</i>.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> Spencer died December 8, 1903.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

The <i>historical antecedents</i> of the synthetic philosophy may be 
reduced to three: (1) from Hamilton and Mansel, and thus ultimately 
from Kant, Spencer drew his metaphysical principles, namely, relativity 
of knowledge and agnosticism; (2) from Comte and the Comtists he 
derived the positivism which appears in his definition of the scope of 
science and in a general way in his plan of the coordination of 
sciences; and (3) from Wolff the anatomist, from Von Baer the 
embryologist, and from 
 <!--
622 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p622"></a>
 Lyell the geologist he borrowed the principle of development which the 
publication of Darwin's work elevated to the rank of a scientific law 
in the biological world.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup><p>

1. <b>Agnosticism</b>. Neither scientific ideas nor religious beliefs 
can express the ultimate nature of reality. The highest scientific 
ideas, such as space, time, matter, involve contradictions 
(antinomies), and theologians themselves admit the inadequacy of our 
idea of the Infinite; for "to think that God is as we think Him to be 
would be blasphemy." Moreover, the nature of consciousness itself shows 
that all knowledge is relative. The conclusion, therefore, is 
inevitable, that ultimate religious ideas and ultimate scientific ideas 
are merely symbols of the actual, not cognitions of it, and that "if 
religion and science are to be reconciled, the basis of reconciliation 
must be this deepest, widest, and most certain of facts, -- that the 
power which the universe manifests to us is utterly inscrutable." The 
ultimate philosophical, as well as the ultimate religious, is unknown 
and unknowable.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> Therefore, when Spencer teaches that the ultimate, 
or Absolute, reveals itself in the forms and laws under which phenomena 
occur, -- "The persistent impressions, being persistent results of a 
persistent cause, are for practical purposes the same as the cause 
itself, and may be habitually dealt with as its equivalents,"<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> -- he 
practically abandons the position of the agnostic and confesses that 
the Absolute is not utterly unknowable.<p>

2. <b>Definition and Data of Philosophy</b>. All knowledge is confined 
to the relations of things. Common knowledge is ununified knowledge; 
science is partially unified knowledge; <i>philosophy is completely 
unified knowledge</i>. The <i>data</i> of philosophy are: (1) the 
existence of likenesses and differences, as is proved by the permanence 
of our consciousness of congruity and incongruity; (2) the distinction 
of <i>self</i> and <i>not-self</i>, the former being 
 <!--
SPENCER'S DEFINITION OF EVOLUTION 623 
 --><A NAME="p623"></a>
 constituted by the current of <i>faint</i> manifestations, and the 
latter by the current of <i>vivid</i> manifestations, of the unknowable 
power; (3) space, time, matter, motion, and force, these being "certain 
most general forms" into which the manifestations of the unknowable are 
separated, and the reality of which science at every moment assumes; 
for by <i>reality</i> we are to understand <i>persistence in 
consciousness</i>, and the persistence of space and time consists in 
this, that they are the universal relations of coexistence and 
sequence, by which (as postulates) we think, while the persistence of 
matter, motion, and force consists in the indestructibility, 
continuity, and persistence, respectively, of these ultimate scientific 
ideas.<p>

Passing now from these analytic truths, we come to inquire, What is the 
<i>law of universal synthesis</i>? What is the universal formula which 
shall combine all the particular formulas of science and philosophy? 
The answer is, <i>The continuous redistribution of matter and 
motion</i>, which involves the double process of <i>evolution</i> (an 
integration of matter and a dissipation of motion) and 
<i>dissolution</i> (a disintegration of matter and an absorption of 
motion). If, now, the word <i>evolution</i> is taken to designate the 
process of development in all its complexity, "Evolution is an 
integration of matter and concomitant dissipation of motion; during 
which the matter passes from an indefinite, incoherent homogeneity to a 
definite, coherent heterogeneity; and during which the retained motion 
undergoes a parallel transformation."<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> This is proved by induction to 
be the law of the physical universe and of psychic and social life. And 
just as in Hegel's philosophy, development implied three stages, so in 
Spencer's theory, evolution starts with the instability of the 
homogeneous, and proceeds, through the multiplication of effects and 
segregation, to the equilibration of forces which constitutes the 
impassable limit of evolution, -- the point where dissolution begins. 
 <!--
624 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p624"></a><p>

3. <b>Special Philosophy of the Sciences</b>. The other portions of the 
synthetic philosophy, namely the <i>special philosophy</i> of biology, 
psychology, sociology, and ethics, are merely the application of the 
evolution formula to the different branches of philosophic inquiry.<p>

<b>Biology</b>. Spencer defines life as "the continuous adjustment of 
internal relations to external relations."<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> He then proceeds to the 
study of growth, function, adaptation, genesis, heredity, variation, 
etc. Taking up<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> the problem of the origin of life, he contrasts the 
special-creation hypothesis with the <i>evolution hypothesis</i>, and 
adduces in favor of the latter arguments from classification, 
embryology, morphology, and distribution. The <i>factors</i> in organic 
evolution are, he teaches, both internal and external.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> "He excludes 
all consideration of the question how life first arose, though it is 
clear that he regards the lowest forms of life as continuous in their 
essential nature with sub-vital processes."<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> For Darwin's phrase, 
"natural selection," Spencer substitutes "the survival of the fittest."<p>

<i>Psychology</i>. Applying to the study of mental phenomena the method 
found to be so fruitful of results in the study of vital phenomena in 
general, Spencer arrives at the conclusion that <i>among mental 
phenomena there are no organic differences</i>, -- reflex action, 
feelings, instinct, intelligence being merely different stages in the 
process of development from the simple to the complex, from the 
indefinite to the definite, from the homogeneous to the heterogeneous.<p>

With regard to the <i>substance of mind</i> Spencer holds that all 
mental action whatsoever is explained by the continuous differentiation 
and integration of states of consciousness. He is not, however, a 
phenomenalist: "Existence," he says, "means nothing more than 
persistence; and hence in mind that which  
 <!--
SPENCER'S PSYCHOLOGY 625 
 --><A NAME="p625"></a>
 persists in spite of all changes, and maintains the unity of the 
aggregate in defiance of all attempts to divide it, . . . is that which 
we must postulate as the substance of mind in contradistinction to the 
varying forms it assumes."<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> This substance of mind is unknowable.<p>

With regard to the <i>origin of ideas</i>, Spencer, rejecting on the 
one hand the empiricism of Locke and Hume, and on the other hand the 
absolute <i>a priorism</i> of Leibniz and Kant, teaches that while the 
universal and necessary elements of intellectual knowledge are <i>a 
priori</i> with reference to the individual, they are not <i>a 
priori</i> with reference to the race. Between the theory of the 
empiricist, who refers all the elements of knowledge to the experience 
of the individual, and that of the transcendentalist, who regards the 
universal and necessary elements of thought as "forms of intuition," 
Spencer finds a <i>via media</i>. In accordance with the general 
principle of evolution, he refers the elements characterizing 
intellectual thought to "organized and semi-organized arrangements," 
which, existing in the cerebral nerves of the child, sum up the 
experience of all his ancestors. Here as elsewhere Spencer seems to 
forget that the survival of the organized and semi-organized 
arrangements merely proves their practical utility in the struggle for 
existence, and can in no way guarantee their validity as tests of 
absolute truth.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup><p>

From such inherited dispositions arises our inability to conceive the 
contradictory of certain principles and truths of fact. This inability 
to conceive the contradictory is the ultimate test of all beliefs, the 
criterion of truth. The universal postulate may therefore be formulated 
as follows: "A cognition which we are obliged to accept because we 
cannot conceive its contradictory is to be classed as having the 
highest possible certainty."<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup>
 <!--
626 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p626"></a><p>

<i>Epistemology</i>. Spencer's epistemology is comprised in his 
doctrine of <i>transfigured realism</i>. He rejects idealism on the 
ground of the priority, immediateness, and superior distinctness of the 
realistic conception of mental processes.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> He next proceeds to show 
that "while <i>some</i> objective existence, manifested under some 
conditions, remains as the final necessity of thought, there does not 
remain the implication that this existence and these conditions are 
more to us than the unknown correlatives of our feelings and the 
relations among our feelings."<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> This realism "stands widely 
distinguished from crude realism; and to mark the distinction it may 
properly be called <i>transfigured realism</i>."<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Sociology</i>. In his various treatises on sociology Spencer 
conceives society, after the manner of the individual organism, as 
possessing a variety of organs and functions, and as tending to evolve 
itself by a series of adjustments to the social and physical 
environment. He insists on the <i>innerness of the principle of social 
development</i>, and emphasizes the truth that societies and 
constitutions are <i>not made</i>, but <i>grow</i>. He is, however, 
careful to point out one very important distinction between the 
individual organism and the social organism: in the individual the 
parts exist for the sake of the whole, while in the society the whole 
exists for the sake of the parts. This distinction is overlooked in 
those forms of society in which <i>militarism</i> and 
<i>officialism</i> predominate. <i>Industrialism</i> is the basis of 
modern social reconstruction. The highest type of social organization 
will, however, be reached when freer scope shall be given to the play 
of those activities which are exercised for the sake of the 
satisfaction they afford, and not for the sake of obtaining the means 
of subsistence.<p>

<i>Ethics</i>. Spencer's system of ethics may be briefly described as 
the substitution of <i>rational utilitarianism</i> for the <i>empirical 
utilitarianism</i> of the school of Bentham. The goal of the process 
 <!--
SPENCER'S ETHICS 627
 --><A NAME="p627"></a>
 of ethical development is <i>the ideal man in the ideal state</i>, -- 
a view which combines, as the earlier form of utilitarianism had 
combined, altruism with egoism. But instead of insisting on the 
"hedonistic calculus" of the earlier utilitarians, Spencer emphasizes 
the rational deduction of the moral ideal from the necessary laws, -- 
physical, biological, psychological, and sociological, -- the 
recognition of which, rather than the calculation of the happiness to 
which human action leads, furnishes the <i>cognitive basis for moral 
action</i>. Moral phenomena must be considered as part of the aggregate 
of phenomena which evolution has wrought out; the <i>moral sense</i> itself is 
a <i>product of evolution</i>: "I believe that the experiences of utility 
organized and consolidated throughout all past generations of the human 
race have been producing corresponding modifications, which, by 
continued transmission and accumulation, have become in us certain 
faculties of moral intuition, -- certain emotions responding to right 
and wrong which have no apparent basis in the individual experiences of 
utility."<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The most distinguished of the opponents of utilitarian ethics in 
England was <b>Dr. Martineau</b> (1805-1900), author of <i>Types of 
Ethical Theory</i> (1885). He defended what is known as the 
preferential theory of ethics, according to which the morality of an 
action is not to be judged by its pleasure-producing effect, but rather 
by the perfection of the motives inspiring it, virtue being defined as 
the rejection of lower and the adoption of higher motives.<p>

<b>St. George Mivart</b> (1827-1900) occupied a unique position among 
the English representatives of the philosophy of evolution during the 
latter half of the nineteenth century. In <i>The Genesis of Species</i> 
(1871), <i>On Truth</i> (1889), etc., he appeared as the defender of 
theistic evolution, and sought to reconcile the evolutionistic 
hypothesis with the essential doctrines of Scholastic philosophy.

<b>Idealism</b>. German idealism was first introduced into England by 
<b>Samuel Taylor Coleridge</b> (1772-1834) and <b>Thomas Carlyle</b> 
(1795-1881). During the latter half of the nineteenth century the 
Hegelian philosophy found many able exponents in Great Britain, of whom 
the most prominent are <b>J. H. Stirling</b> (born 1820), <b>John 
Caird</b> (1820-1898), <b>Edward Caird</b> (born 1835), and <b>Thomas 
Hill Green</b> (1836-1882).<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> Green's <i>Prolegomena to Ethics</i> 
(fourth edition, 1899) represents the first important contribution to 
English Hegelianism. Green considers that metaphysics is the foundation 
of ethics, and that <i>without a metaphysical theory a theory of ethics 
is "wasted labor."</i> The primary questions of metaphysics are: What 
are the facts of my own individual consciousness? and, What is the 
simplest explanation I can give of the origin of these facts? That is 
necessarily true which is required to explain my experience. Applying 
this test to the evolution doctrine, Green, while admitting the fact of 
the biological evolution of man, protests against any biological 
explanation which cannot account for the facts of individual 
consciousness. "If there are reasons," he writes, "for holding that 
man, in respect to his animal nature, is descended from 'mere' animals, 
. . . this does not affect our conclusion in regard to the 
consciousness of which, as he now is, man is the subject, a conclusion 
founded on analysis of what he now is and does."<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The <i>"whole" is not material, but spiritual</i>, -- a world of 
"thought relations" consisting of three main facts, <i>self, 
cosmos</i>, and <i>God</i>. Self is first in the order of knowledge: 
God the Eternal Consciousness, which manifests itself in the spiritual 
cosmos, is first in the order of being. "The unification of the 
manifold in the world implies the presence of the manifold to a mind, 
for which, and through the action of which, it is a related  
 <!--
IDEALISM IN ENGLAND 629
 --><A NAME="p629"></a>
 whole. The unification of the manifold of sense in our consciousness 
of a world implies a certain self-realization of this mind in us 
through certain processes (life and feeling) of the world which only 
exist through it."<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In his <i>ethical doctrines</i> Green insists on self-reflection as the 
only possible method of learning what is the inner man or mind that our 
action expresses, and he emphasizes the importance of man's looking 
forward to a moral ideal to be attained by conscious effort, rather 
than backward to a series of natural changes through which man came to 
be what he is. "Our ultimate standard of worth is an ideal of personal 
worth," not the well-being of the race but the <i>perfection of human 
character according to the divine plan</i>.<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. It is impossible to judge with anything 
like definiteness systems of thought, some of which are still in the 
process of formation, while others are in the process of dissolution. 
When, however, we look back over the course of English philosophy 
during the nineteenth century, two conclusions appear to be 
indisputable; namely, that the associationist account of the mind and 
of mental processes has been definitely abandoned, and that whatever 
changes the evolution doctrine may have wrought in the method and 
standpoint of philosophy, its importance as a contribution to ultimate 
philosophic truth must depend largely on whether it will materially 
affect the great gnostic idealistic movement, which during the last 
quarter of a century has apparently superseded the agnostic empirical 
movement. It is not to the evolutionistic synthesis of Spencer but 
rather to the idealistic constructions of such men as Green that we 
must look for a solution of the question, What is the present tendency, 
and what is likely to be the future trend, of philosophical speculation 
in England?<p>
