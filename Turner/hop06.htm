THE SOPHISTS</h3><p>

Sophistic philosophy, which constitutes so important a crisis in the 
history of Greek thought and civilization, was germinally contained in 
the preceding systems. Atomistic materialism culminated in the Sophism 
of Protagoras; the doctrines of Heraclitus paved the way to Scepticism, 
as was demonstrated by Cratylus, the teacher of Plato; and Gorgias the 
Sophist merely carried to excess the dialectic method introduced by 
Zeno the Eleatic. All these schools -- Atomistic, Heraclitean, Eleatic 
-- had, as has been said, attacked by the aid of specious fallacies the 
trustworthiness of common consciousness, so that until Socrates 
appeared on the scene to determine the conditions of scientific 
knowledge no positive development of philosophy was possible. Meantime 
there was nothing left but to deny the possibility of attaining 
knowledge. And that is what the Sophists did: they are the first 
Sceptics of Greece.<p>

There was, then, an inevitable tendency on the part of the prevalent 
philosophy to culminate in Scepticism. Besides, the 
 <!--
THE SOPHISTS 71 
 --><A NAME="p71"></a>
 social and political conditions of the time contributed to the same 
result by unsettling the moral and religious ideals which the Athenian 
had hitherto held as matters of tradition. The Persian wars and the 
military achievements of subsequent years brought about an upheaval in 
the social and political condition of Athens. Old ideas were being 
adjusted to new circumstances, the scope of education was being 
widened; in a word, "the whole epoch was penetrated with a spirit of 
revolution and progress," and none of the existing forces could hold 
that spirit in checks We must take into account also the development of 
poetry and especially of the drama. "The whole action of the drama," 
says Zeller, "comic as well as tragic, is based (at this time) on the 
collision of duties and rights -- on a dialectic of moral relations 
and duties."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> The period was one of revolution and readjustment.<p>

<b>History of the Sophists</b>. The word <i>Sophist</i>, etymologically 
considered, denotes a wise man. In the earlier pre-Socratic period it 
meant one who made wisdom or the teaching of wisdom his profession. 
Later on, the abuse of dialectic disputation of which the Sophists were 
guilty caused the name <i>sophism</i> to become synonymous with 
<i>fallacy</i>.<p>

The Sophists flourished from about 450 B.C. to 400 B.C.; not that 
Sophism as a profession disappeared altogether at the latter date, but, 
after the appearance of Socrates as a teacher, the importance of the 
Sophist dwindled into insignificance.<p>

The first Sophists are represented as going about from city to city, 
gathering around them the young men and imparting to them in 
consideration of certain fees the instruction requisite for the conduct 
of public affairs. In the instruction which they gave they set no value 
upon objective truth; indeed, the ideal at which they aimed was the art 
of making the worse seem the better cause, and vice versa. Readiness of 
exposition and presentation of arguments in a specious manner were all 
that they pretended to teach.<p>

Such is the history of the school in general. The chief Sophists are 
Protagoras of Abdera, the <i>individualist</i>; Gorgias of Leontini, the 
<i>nihilist</i>; Hippias of Elis, the <i>polymathist</i>; and Prodicus of Ceos, the 
<i>moralist</i>.

<b>Sources</b>. It is difficult, as Plato<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> points out, to define 
accurately the nature of the Sophist. The Sophists left no fixed 
theorems equally acknowledged by all the school. They were 
characterized more by their mode of thought than by any fixed content 
of thought. Besides, Plato, Aristotle, and all our other authorities 
are so avowedly hostile to the Sophists, and raise so unreasonable 
objections to Sophism (as when they accuse the Sophists of bartering 
the mere semblance of knowledge for gold), that we must weigh and 
examine their every statement before we can admit it as evidence.
  
DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Protagoras</b> of Abdera (born about 480 B.C.) Composed many works, 
of which, however, only a few fragments have survived. Plato<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> traces 
the opinions of Protagoras to the influence of Heraclitus. Nothing is, 
all is Becoming; but, even this Becoming is relative. As the eye does 
not see, except while it is being acted upon, so the object is not 
colored except while it acts upon the eye.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Nothing, therefore, 
becomes in and for itself but only for the percipient subject.<p>

Hence, as the object presents itself differently to different subjects, 
there is no objective truth: Man is the measure of all things. Plato 
apparently reports these as the very words of Protagoras<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup>: 
<b>ph&ecirc;si gar pou pant&ocirc;n chr&ecirc;mat&ocirc;n metron 
anthr&ocirc;pon einai t&ocirc;n men ont&ocirc;n h&ocirc;s esti, 
t&ocirc;n de m&ecirc; ont&ocirc;n h&ocirc;s ouk estin</b>.<p>

Grote<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> and others doubt whether the above is really the line of 
thought followed out by Protagoras himself. In both Plato and Aristotle 
we find allusions to the employment by Protagoras of the dialectic 
introduced by Zeno. Moreover, if we are to make the argument valid, we 
must, before we conclude that <i>all knowledge is relative</i>, 
introduce the atomistic principle that all knowledge is conditioned by 
physical alterations.<p>

The <i>relativity of knowledge</i>, as it was professed by Protagoras, 
is a denial of all objective truth and a reduction of  
 <!--
THE SOPHISTS 73
 --><A NAME="p73"></a>
 knowledge to individual opinion. It follows from this that a 
proposition and its opposite are equally true if they appear to 
different persons to be true. In this way did Protagoras lay the 
foundation of the <i>eristic</i> method, -- the method of dispute, --  
which is associated with the name <i>Sophist</i>, and which was carried 
to such extremes by the Sophists of later times.<p>

"<i>Of the gods</i>," said Protagoras, "I can know nothing, neither 
that they are nor that they are not. There is much to prevent our 
attaining this knowledge -- the obscurity of the subject and the 
shortness of human life." These are the famous words with which, 
according to Diogenes,<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Protagoras began the treatise that was made 
the basis of a charge of impiety, and led ultimately to his expulsion 
from Athens. They contain a profession of agnosticism. Perhaps the 
context, if we possessed it, would show whether Protagoras went further 
and really professed atheism, the crime of which he was accused.<p> 

<b>Gorgias</b> of Leontini, a contemporary of Protagoras, composed a 
treatise, <i>On Nature, or the Non-Existing</i>, which is preserved by 
Sextus Empiricus. We possess, as secondary authority, a portion of the 
pseudo-Aristotelian treatise <i>Concerning Xenophanes, etc.</i><p>

As it was the aim of Protagoras to show that everything is equally 
true, it may be said that Gorgias strove to show that everything is 
equally false. The latter proves by the use of dialectical reasoning 
that (1) Nothing exists; (2) Even if it existed, it could not be known; 
and (3) Even if knowledge were possible, it could not be 
communicated.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Hippias</b> of Elis, a younger contemporary of Protagoras, was 
preeminent even among the Sophists for the vanity with which he paraded 
his proficiency in rhetoric, mathematics, astronomy, and archaeology. He 
boasted that he could say something new on any topic, however often it 
might have been discussed.  
 <!--
74 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p74"></a>
 Plato<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> attributes to him the saying that law is a tyrant of men, 
since it prescribes many things contrary to nature. This was probably 
meant as a bold paradox, one of the many devices by which the Sophists 
attracted the admiration of the Athenians.<p>

<b>Prodicus</b> of Ceos was also a contemporary of Protagoras. Such was 
the esteem in which he was held by Socrates that the latter often 
called himself his pupil, and did not hesitate to direct young men to 
him for instruction.<p>

Prodicus is best known by his moral discourses, in which he shows the 
excellence of virtue and the misery of a life given over to pleasure. 
The most celebrated of these discourses is entitled <i>Hercules at the 
Cross-Roads</i>. The choice of a career, the employment of wealth, the 
unreasonableness of the fear of death, are some of the subjects on 
which he delivered exhortations.<p>

In spite of all this, Prodicus, as a Sophist, could not consistently 
avoid moral scepticism. If there is no truth, there is no law. If that 
is true which seems to be true, then that is good which seems to be 
good. He did not, accordingly, attempt to define virtue or moral good: 
he merely drew pictures of the ethical ideals, exhorting rather than 
teaching. The first to attempt a systematic treatment of ethical 
problems was he who first strove to fix the conditions of scientific 
knowledge through concepts, -- Socrates, with whom the second period 
of Greek philosophy begins.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Sophistic philosbphy was the outcome of the 
complex influences which shaped the social, political, philosophical, 
and religious conditions of Athens during the latter half of the fifth 
century before Christ. It was the philosophy which suited that age. 
Pericles found pleasure in the society of Sophists, Euripides esteemed 
them, Thucydides sought instruction from them, and Socrates sent 
them pupils.<p>

Yet Sophism did not constitute an advance in philosophic thought. It is 
true that it directed attention to the subjective 
 <!--
THE SOPHISTS 75
 --><A NAME="p75"></a>
 element in human knowledge. In fact, it made the subjective element 
everything in knowledge; it reduced truth to the level of opinion, and 
made man the measure of all things. And herein lay the essential error 
of Sophism, vitiating the whole system. Sophism was not the beginning 
of an era in philosophy: it was more properly the ending of the era 
which preceded Socrates. The onward movement of thought was not resumed 
until Socrates showed that knowledge is as far from being wholly 
subjective as it is from being wholly objective. It is Socrates, 
therefore, who inaugurates the new era.<p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. Greek philosophy exhibits in its historical 
development a rhythm of movement which is perfect in the simplicity of 
the formula by which it is expressed -- <i>objective, subjective -
objective, subjective</i>. Pre-Socratic philosophy was objective; the 
philosophy of Socrates and the Socratic schools was partly objective, 
partly subjective, while the philosophy of later times was almost 
entirely subjective. By the objectivity of pre-Socratic philosophy is 
meant that:<p>

1. It concerned itself almost exclusively with the problems of the 
physical world, paying little attention to the study of man, his 
origin, dignity, and destiny.<p>

2. It did not busy itself with the problems of epistemology. At first 
all sense-presentations were taken without question or criticism as 
true presentations of reality, and even when the Eleatics distinguished 
between reason and sense they did not go any farther towards 
determining the conditions of rational knowledge.<p>

3. Ethics was not studied scientifically; compared with cosmogony, 
cosmology, and metaphysics, it did not receive proportionate attention.<p>

Briefly, the philosophy of Greece before the time of Socrates possessed 
all the <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> that was to be expected in the first 
speculative attempts of a people who never tired of nature and never 
looked beyond nature for their ideals.<p>
