CATHOLIC PHILOSOPHY IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY</h3><p>

Philosophy is more closely allied to theology and to literature than is 
any of the other sciences. If, therefore, the manifold relations of 
philosophy to literature entitle us to speak of German, French, and 
English philosophy, surely the intimate alliance of philosophy with the 
doctrinal system of the Church justifies the appellation Catholic 
philosophy. 
 <!--
638 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p638"></a><p>

Few of the names of those who represented Scholastic philosophy during 
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have risen into prominence in 
the history of philosophy. The following, however, rendered 
considerable service to Scholastic philosophy by their interpretations 
and expositions of the schoolmen: <b>Cosmo Alemanni</b> (1559-1634), 
<b>Sylvester Maurus</b> (1619-1687), both of whom were Jesuits and 
taught at the Roman College,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> the Dominican <b>Antoine Goudin</b> 
(1639-1695), the authors of the <i>Cursus Philosophiae Complutensis</i> 
(Alcal&aacute;),<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> and the Franciscan <b>Claudius Frassen</b>
 (1620-1711), whose <i>Scotus Academicus</i> is being republished by 
the Franciscans of the College of Sant' Antonio (Rome, 1900 ff.). These 
belong to the seventeenth century. To the seventeenth century belong 
also <b>Caramuel</b> (1606-1682), <b>Roselli</b> (end of seventeenth 
century), whose <i>Summa Philosophica</i> is said to have furnished the 
basis for the Thomistic reconstruction of the nineteenth century, and 
<b>Guerinois</b> (1640-1703), whose <i>Clypeus Philosophiae 
Thomisticae</i>, etc., is an elaborate refutation of Cartesianism. To 
the eighteenth century belong Father <b>Boscovich</b>, S.J. (1711-1787), 
and Cardinal <b>Gerdil</b> (1718-1802). Father Boscovich was professor of 
philosophy and mathematics at the Roman College. He attained very great 
prominence by his theory of the ultimate composition of matter, which 
may be described as a modification of Leibniz' monadism. Matter, 
Boscovich taught, is composed of indivisible, unextended points, which 
were originally placed at a fixed distance from each other and endowed 
with the forces of attraction and repulsion. 
 <!--
CATHOLIC PHILOSOPHY 639 
 --><A NAME="p639"></a>
 Cardinal Gerdil defended the philosophy of Descartes and Malebranche, 
and advocated a modified ontologism.<p>

During the nineteenth century Germany, France, Spain, and Italy 
produced a large number of distinguished philosophers who admitted in 
one form or another the supremacy of Christian revelation as contained 
in the teachings of the Catholic Church, and are on this account to be 
included in the history of Catholic philosophy.<p>

<b>Germany</b>. In Germany <b>Franz Baader</b> (1765-1841), of whom 
mention has already been made,<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> opposed the anti-Christian tendencies 
in the philosophical systems of Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel. In 
his account, however, of the origin of the universe he shows traces of 
the influence of the transcendentalists, and in his theory of the soul 
he betrays the influence of Origen and the Gnostics. <b>Johann 
Frohschammer</b><sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> (born 1821) also occupied himself with the 
refutation of anti-Christian theories, devoting special attention to 
the criticism of materialism. But, like Baader, he was led by his study 
of the transcendentalists to profess a form of philosophic belief 
incompatible with Catholic dogma. In the work, <i>Die Phantasie als 
Grundprincip des Weltprocesses</i> (1877), he proposes imagination in 
place of the Hegelian spirit and Schopenhauer's will, as the immanent 
and transcendent principle of the evolution of the world. He is 
careful, however, to make a formal declaration of the superiority of 
God with respect to this principle of evolution. There is apparent in 
his writings a tendency to rationalize theology to the extent of 
bringing the mysteries of faith within the scope of philosophical 
speculation, -- a tendency which became a principle openly avowed in 
the writings of <b>Georg Hermes</b> (1775-1831). Hermes makes reason 
the ultimate criterion of all truth, supernatural as well as natural, 
and attempts to establish by the aid of reason the dogmas of the 
Catholic faith. His doctrines 
 <!--
640 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p640"></a>
 were condemned by the Church,<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> and his writings placed on the 
<i>Index</i> (1835). Another movement towards the identification of 
theology with philosophy is represented by <b>Anton G&uuml;nther</b><sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> 
(1783-1863), who maintained that if revelation is necessary it is 
because of the "weakness of the understanding" which results from 
original sin; that, <i>of itself</i>, human reason is capable of 
proving all truth; but that in man's present condition, faith is the 
foundation of all knowledge. These errors were condemned in 1857.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The most remarkable of the German Catholic philosophers of this period 
was <b>Joseph G&ouml;rres</b> (1776-1848), who, in <i>Die Christliche 
Mystik</i> and other writings, developed a fantastic system of 
spiritism. He maintained that, besides the visible material body, man 
possesses a subtle body composed of imponderable fluid which remains 
united to the soul after death and returns to earth with the soul 
whenever the latter appears as a ghost.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Mention must also be made of <b>Franz Anton Staudenmaler</b>
 (1800-1856), who was associated with Gunther and Frohschammer in the 
refutation of anti-Christian doctrines, while he differed from them in 
his adherence to strict orthodoxy and his condemnation of rationalism 
and semi-rationalism. It was, however, the Jesuit Father 
<b>Kleutgen</b> (1811-1883), author of the <i>Philosophie der 
Vorzeit</i> (1860 ff.), and <b>Dr. Albert St&ouml;ckl</b> (1823-1895), 
author of the <i>Geschichte der Philosophie des Mittelalters</i>
 (1864-1866), who rendered the greatest service to the cause of 
Scholastic philosophy in Germany, and prepared the way for the 
contemporary Neo-Scholastic movement in that country.  
 <!--

<b>France</b>. In France the traditionalists and ontologists were 
succeeded by a group of distinguished <i>conf&eacute;renciers</i> and 
apologists, who in their discourses and writings expounded and defended 
the traditional philosophy of the Schools in its application to 
practical issues. Chief among these were <b>P&egrave;re Lacordaire</b>, 
O.P. (1802-1861), <b>P&egrave;re de Ravignan</b>, S.J. (1795-1858), 
<b>Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Ozanam</b> (1813-1853), <b>Mgr. D'Hulst</b> 
(1841-1896), and <b>L'Abb&eacute; de Broglie</b> (1834-1895).<p>

<b>Spain</b>. In Spain<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> the succession of philosophical systems 
during the nineteenth century was almost identical with that which 
occurred in France. During the first years of the century, 
philosophical speculation in Spain reflected the sensism and empiricism 
of Condillac's school. Then came a reaction in favor of spiritualistic 
philosophy in the form of a modified traditionalism and ontologism.<p>

The most distinguished name in the history of philosophic thought in 
modern Spain is that of <b>Jaime Balmes</b> (1810-1848), author of 
<i>Filosof&iacute;a fundamental</i> and of <i>El Protestantismo 
comparado con el Catolicismo</i>. The basic principles of Balmes' 
philosophy are Thomistic; to these, however, he adds elements derived 
from Descartes, Leibniz, and the Scottish school. He restricts, for 
example, the region of <i>rational certitude</i> to subjective 
phenomena, maintaining that the certitude which we possess with 
reference to objective phenomena is instinctive and more akin to the 
certitude of faith than to scientific certitude. He departs also from 
the teachings of St. Thomas in rejecting the <i>active intellect</i> 
and the <i>intelligible species</i>. His discussion of the <i>criteria 
of truth</i>, to which he devoted a special treatise (<i>El 
Criterio</i>), is perhaps his most valuable contribution to philosophy. 
Exceedingly able, too, is his refutation of scepticism in the work 
entitled <i>Cartas d un esc&eacute;ptico</i>.<p>

<b>Juan Donoso Cort&eacute;s</b> (1809-1853), "the De Maistre of 
Spain," although not a professed philosopher of any school, 
contributed 
 <!--
642 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p642"></a>
 to the establishment of the spiritualistic philosophy by his profound 
philosophical reflections on the religious, political, and social 
topics of the day. His principal work is entitled <i>Ensayo sobre el 
Catolicismo, el liberalismo y el socialismo</i>.<p>

<b>England</b>. In England the Oxford movement, which is the most 
striking illustration of the assertion of the principle of authority as 
opposed to individualism in matters of religious thought, gave to 
Catholic intellectual activity in that country a decidedly theological 
trend. Cardinal Newman (1801-1890) may be said to have formulated in 
his <i>Grammar of Assent</i> a theory of estimation of theological 
evidence. <i>The Metaphysics of the Schools</i>, by Father <b>Thomas 
Harper</b>, S.J., is an elaborate attempt at presenting Scholastic 
philosophy in a form accessible to English readers.<p>

<b>Italy</b>. In Italy Catholic philosophy during the nineteenth 
century experienced a revival which, within the last twenty-five years, 
has spread its influence throughout the entire Church. During the reign 
of Pius IX, Fathers <b>Liberatore</b> (1810-1892), <b>Cornoldi</b> 
(1822-1892), and others contributed to the <i>Civilt&agrave; 
Cattolica</i> articles in which the principles of Rosmini's idealism 
were criticised and the traditional philosophy of the schools expounded 
and defended. To Father Cornoldi belongs the honor of having founded at 
Bologna, in 1874, the Philosophical Academy of St. Thomas of Aquin, 
which, until the year 1891, continued to publish <i>La Scienza 
Italiana</i>. Canon <b>Sanseverino</b> (1811-1865), author of 
<i>Philosophia Christiana cum Antiqua et Nova Comparata</i>, his pupil 
Canon <b>Signoriello</b> (1821-1889), author of a <i>Lexicon 
Peripateticum Philosophico- Theologicum</i>, and Mgr. <b>Talamo</b>, 
author of <i>l' Aristotelismo della Scolastica, etc.</i>, are to be 
mentioned among those who prepared the way for the Neo-Scholastic 
movement inaugurated at the beginning of the reign of Leo XIII.<p>

<b>Neo-Scholastic Movement</b>. In the encyclical <i>Inscrutabili Dei 
Consilio</i> published in 1878, in the encyclical <i>AEterni Patris</i> 
(1879), in briefs relating to the foundation of the Roman Academy of 
St. Thomas (1879) and of the Institut Sup&eacute;rieur 
 <!--
THE NEO-SCHOLASTIC MOVEMENT 643 
 --><A NAME="p643"></a>
 de Philosophie at the University of Louvain (1894), and in many other 
documents, Leo XIII has encouraged and promoted the study of the great 
masters of Scholasticism, and in particular the study of St. Thomas of 
Aquin. In all these documents Pope Leo insists on: (1) the return to 
the study of the texts of the Scholastic writers of the thirteenth 
century: "Providete ut sapientia Thomae ex ipsis ejus fontibus 
hauriatur"; (2) the exclusion of such problems as are more subtle than 
profitable, and the rejection of such doctrines of the schoolmen as 
have been proved to be false: "Si quid est a doctoribus Scholasticis 
vel nimia subtilitate quaesitum, vel parum considerate traditum, si quid 
cum exploratis posterioris aevi doctrinis minus cohaerens . . . id nullo 
pacto in animo est aetati nostrae ad imitandum proponi"; and (3) the 
extension and completion of the Scholastic system: "Vetera novis augere 
et perficere." It is, therefore, in no spirit of undiscriminating 
devotion to the past, but rather in the spirit of thorough and 
scholarly appreciation of the past, that the representatives of
 Neo-Scholasticism have discarded as useless those <i>Compendia ad 
Mentem Divi Thomae</i> in which Scholastic philosophy was watered down 
to the taste of the modern reader, and have gone back to the study of 
the texts of the masters.<p>

Prominent among those who have contributed to the success of the
 Neo-Scholastic movement are Cardinals <b>Pecci</b> (1807-1890), 
<b>Zigilara</b> (1833-1893), and <b>Satolli</b>, Mgr. 
<b>Lorenzelli</b>,<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> the Jesuit Fathers <b>De Maria</b> and <b>De 
Mandato</b>, and the Dominican Father <b>Lepidi</b>.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> In 
 <!--
644 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p644"></a>
 Germany the movement was taken up by Father <b>Tilmann Pesch</b> and 
the other Jesuit authors of the <i>Philosophia Lacensis</i>, while in 
France it has had many able representatives, among them the Sulpician, 
M. l'Abb&eacute; <b>Farges</b>.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> The most notable English 
contribution to the Neo-Scholastic literature is the <i>Stonyhurst 
Series of Manuals of Catholic Philosophy</i>. Mention must also be made 
of the excellent publications of the Institut Sup&eacute;rieur de 
Philosophie of the University of Louvain, namely, the <i>Cours de 
Philosophie</i> by Mgr. <b>Mercier, K. De Wulf, D. Nys</b>, and others, 
and also of the periodicals <i>Divus Thomas, La Revue Thomiste</i>, and 
<i>La Revue N&eacute;o-Scolastique</i>.<p>
