<h3 align="center">CHAPTER V<br>
THE ATOMISTS</h3><p>

The Atomists represent the last phase of Ionian speculation concerning 
nature. They accept the dualistic ideas which characterize the Later 
Ionian philosophy, but by their substitution of necessity for 
intelligent force they abandon all that dualistic philosophy had to 
bequeath to them, and fall lower than the level which the early 
hylozoists had reached.<p>

It was at Miletus that the Ionian philosophy first appeared, and it was 
Miletus that produced Leucippus, the founder of Atomism, who virtually 
brings the first period of Greek philosophy to a close. So little is 
known of Leucippus that his very existence has been questioned.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> His 
opinions, too, have been so imperfectly transmitted to us that it is 
usual to speak of the tenets of the Atomists without distinguishing 
how much we owe to Leucippus, who by Aristotle and Theophrastus is 
regarded as the founder of the system, and how much we owe to 
Democritus, who was the ablest and best-known expounder of atomistic 
philosophy.<p>

DEMOCRITUS<p>

<b>Life</b>. Democritus of Abdera was born about the year 460 B.C. It is 
said -- though it is by no means certain -- that he received instruction 
from the Magi and other Oriental teachers. It is undoubtedly true that, 
at a later time, he was regarded as a sorcerer and magician, -- a 
fact which may account for the legend of his early training. He was 
probably a disciple of Leucippus. There is no historical foundation for 
the widespread belief that he laughed at everything.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Sources</b>. If, as is probable, Leucippus committed his doctrines 
to writing, no trustworthy fragment of his works has reached us. From 
the titles and  
 <!--
66 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p66"></a>
 the fragments of the works of Democritus it is evident that the latter 
covered in his written treatises a large variety of subjects. The most 
celebrated of these treatises was entitled <b>megas diakosmos</b>. Mullach 
(<i>Fragmenta</i>, I, 340 ff.) publishes fragments of this and other 
Democritean writings.<p>

Aristotle in the <i>Metaphysics</i> and elsewhere gives an adequate 
account of the doctrines of Leucippus and Democritus.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>General Standpoint</b>. One of the reasons which led the Eleatics to 
deny plurality and Becoming was that these are inconceivable without 
void, and void is unthinkable. Now, the Atomists concede that without 
void there is no motion, but they maintain that void exists, and that 
in it exists an infinite number of indivisible bodies (<b>atomoi</b>) 
which constitute the plenum. Aristotle is therefore justified in 
saying<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> that according to Leucippus and Democritus the elements are 
the full (<b>pl&ecirc;res</b>) and the void (<b>kenon</b>). The full 
corresponds to Eleatic Being and the void to not-Being. But the latter 
is as real as the former.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> On the combination and separation of atoms 
depend Becoming and decay.<p>

<b>The Atoms</b>. The atoms, infinite in number and indivisible, differ 
in shape, order, and position.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> They differ, moreover, in quantity, or 
magnitude,<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> for they are not mere mathematical points, their 
indivisibility being due to the fact that they contain no void. They 
have, as we would say, the same specific gravity, but because of their 
different sizes they differ in weight.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The <b>Motion</b> by which the atoms are brought together is not caused 
by a vital principle inherent in them (hylozoism), 
 <!--
THE ATOMISTS 67 
 --><A NAME="p67"></a>
 nor by love and hatred, nor by any incorporeal agency, but by 
<i>natural necessity</i>, by virtue of which atoms of equal weight come 
together. It is, therefore, incorrect to say that the Atomists 
explained the motion of the atoms by attributing it to <i>chance</i>. 
Aristotle gave occasion to this misunderstanding by identifying 
<b>automaton</b> and <b>tuch&ecirc;</b> though it is Cicero<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> who is 
accountable for giving the misapprehension the wide circulation which 
it obtained.<p>

The atomistic explanation was, therefore, that atoms of different 
weights fell with unequal velocities in the primitive void. The heavier 
atoms, consequently, impinged on the lighter ones, imparting to them a 
<i>whirling motion</i> (<b>din&ecirc;</b>). The Atomists, as Aristotle 
remarks,<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> did not advert to the fact that <i>in vacuo</i> all bodies 
fall with equal velocity. Nowhere in the cosmological scheme of the 
Atomists is there place for mind or design; it is utter materialism and 
casualism, if by casualism is meant the exclusion of intelligent 
purpose.<p>

<b>Anthropology</b>. Plants and animals sprang from moist earth. 
Democritus, according to our authorities, devoted special attention to 
the study of Man, who, he believes, is, even on account of his bodily 
structure alone, deserving of admiration. He not only describes as 
minutely as he can the bodily organization of man, but, departing from 
his mechanical concept of nature, takes pains to show the utility and 
adaptation of every part of the human body. But over all and permeating 
all is the <i>soul</i>. Now the soul, for the Atomists, could be 
nothing but corporeal. It is composed of the finest atoms, perfectly 
smooth and round, like the atoms of fire.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> Democritus, accordingly, 
does not deny a distinction between soul and body. He teaches that the 
soul is the noblest part of man; man's crowning glory is moral 
excellence. He is said to have reckoned the human soul among the 
divinities.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> And yet, for Democritus, as for every 
 <!--
68 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p68"></a>
 materialist, the soul is but a finer kind of matter. Indeed, according 
to Aristotle,<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> the Atomists identified soul-atoms with the atoms of 
fire which are floating in the air.<p>

The Atomists' <i>theory of cognition</i> was, of course, determined by 
their view of the nature of the soul. They were obliged to start out 
with the postulate that all cognitive processes are corporeal 
processes, and since the action of body upon body is conditioned by 
contact, they were obliged to conclude that all the senses are mere 
modifications of the sense of touch.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The contact which is a necessary condition of all sense-knowledge is 
effected by means of <i>emanations</i> (<b>aporroai</b>, -- the term is 
Aristotle's), or <i>images</i> (<b>eid&ocirc;la, deikela</b>). These 
are material casts, or shells, given off from the surface of the 
object; they produce in the medium the impressions which enter the 
pores of the senses. They are practically the same as the Epicurean 
<i>effluxes</i>, which Lucretius describes:<p>

<blockquote>
Quae, quasi membranae, summo de corpore rerum<br> 
Dereptae, volitant ultro citroque per auras.  
</blockquote><p>

<i>Thought</i> cannot differ essentially from sense-knowledge. They are 
both changes (<b>heteroi&ocirc;seis</b>) of the soul-substance 
occasioned by material impressions. Logically, therefore, Democritus 
should have attached the same value to thought as to sense-knowledge, 
and since sense-knowledge is obscure (skoti&ecirc;), he should have 
concluded that no knowledge is satisfactory. He saves himself, however, 
from absolute Scepticism, although at the expense of logical 
consistency; for he maintains that thought, by revealing the existence 
of invisible atoms, shows us the true nature of things. The doctrine 
which Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> attributes to Democritus is his opinion as to what 
Democritus should have taught, rather than an account of what he 
actually did teach.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--

<b>Ethics</b>. Although most of the extant fragments which contain 
Democritus' ethical teachings are merely isolated axioms without any 
scientific connection, yet our secondary authorities attribute to him a 
<i>theory of happiness</i> which is really the beginning of the science 
of ethics among the Greeks. From what Democritus says of the 
superiority of the soul over the body, of thought over sense, it is 
natural to expect that he should place man's supreme happiness in a 
right disposition of mind and not in the goods of the external world. 
"Happiness," he says,<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> "and unhappiness do not dwell in herds nor in 
gold; the soul is the abode of the Divinity." Happiness is in no 
external thing, but in "cheerfulness and well-being, a right 
disposition and unalterable peace of mind." The word which is here 
rendered <i>cheerfulness</i> (<b>euthumia</b>) is interpreted by Seneca 
and other Stoics as <i>tranquillity</i>. Democritus, however, was more 
akin to the Epicureans than to the Stoics, and it is probable that by 
<b>euthumia</b> he meant "delight" or "good cheer."<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> There is in the 
moral maxims of Democritus a note of pessimism. Happiness, he believes, 
is difficult of attainment, while misery seeks man unsought.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The atomistic movement is recognized as an 
attempt to reconcile the conclusions of the Eleatics with the facts of 
experience. It is not easy, however, to determine with accuracy how far 
the Atomists were influenced by their predecessors and contemporaries. 
Even if the dates of Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Empedocles, and Leucippus 
were known more definitely than they are, it would still be a matter of 
no small difficulty to show in what degree each philosopher depended on 
and in turn influenced the thought and writings of the others. One 
thing is certain: it was Atomism which more than any of the other
 pre-Socratic systems prepared the way for Sophism and the consequent 
contempt of all knowledge.  
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 70 
 --><A NAME="p70"></a><p>

In the first place, atomistic philosophy was materialistic, and 
"Materialism ends where the highest problems of philosophy begin." 
Moreover, the armor of the Atomist offered several vulnerable points to 
the shafts of Sophism. He fallaciously concluded that atoms are 
uncaused because they are eternal; and, what is worse, he 
inconsistently maintained the difference in value between
 sense-knowledge and thought. The Sophists might well argue, as indeed 
some of them did argue, that if the senses are not to be trusted, 
reason also is untrustworthy, for the soul, according to the Atomists, 
is, like the senses, corporeal. Thus did atomistic philosophy prepare 
the way for Sophism.<p>
