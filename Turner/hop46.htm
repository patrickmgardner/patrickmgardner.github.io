THE MYSTIC SCHOOL</h3><p>

The revival of the principles of mysticism was a natural result of the 
decadent condition of philosophy during the fourteenth and fifteenth 
centuries. The heaping of subtlety on subtlety and the interminable 
controversies of the advocates of Thomism and Scotism bewildered and 
disgusted the serious seeker after spiritual light and drove him 
eventually to abandon all intellectual philosophy in favor of a life of 
contemplation and prayer. Many believed with the author of the 
<i>Imitation of Christ</i> that it is better to feel contrition than to 
know its definition, and that he is very learned indeed who does the 
will of God and renounces his own will. However, the condemnation of 
philosophy by the mystics reacted on the mystics themselves. Being 
unwilling to enter into the disputes of the schools, and obeying to the 
letter their resolve to abstain from philosophical speculation, they 
were unable to detect error when it was introduced into their own 
school. They judged all philosophy by the decadent systems which then 
flourished, and in their depreciation of purely rational speculation 
they overlooked the fact that without the safeguard of systematic dogma 
mysticism is unable to resist the inroads of pantheism and other 
errors. Thus it happened that the first mystics, who drew from the pure 
Christian sources, were soon followed by others, who drew from sources 
tainted with the pantheism of the Averroists. We must distinguish, 
therefore, the orthodox mystics and the heterodox mystics.<p>

<b>Orthodox Mystics. John Ruysbroek</b> (1293-1381) may be regarded as 
the founder of the orthodox mysticism of this period. After having been 
chaplain at St. Gudule, in Brussels, he retired to the convent of the 
Augustinians at Groenendael, where he gave himself to the study and 
practice of asceticism. Through <b>Gerhard Groot</b> (1340-1384), the 
founder of the Brothers 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p412"></a>
 of the Common Life, the influence of Ruysbroek reached the members of 
the community at Deventer, among whom was <b>Thomas Hemerken</b> or 
<b>&agrave; Kempis</b> (1380-1471),<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> the author of the Imitation of 
Christ.<p>

GERSON<p>

<b>Life</b>. The most influential of the orthodox mystics of the 
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was John Gerson, <i>Doctor 
Christianissimus</i>. He was born at Gerson, in the diocese of Rheims, 
about the year 1364. After having studied under Peter d'Ailly in the 
Faculty of Arts at Paris, he entered the department of theology, and in 
1395 became chancellor of the university. In 1397 he went to Bruges, 
where he made the acquaintance of the Flemish exponents of mysticism. 
In 1401 he returned to Paris, but about the year 1419 was obliged to 
retire from the university for having advocated the cause of the 
opponents of papal authority. He entered the monastery of the 
Celestines at Lyons, and there devoted himself to prayer and study. He 
died in the year 1429. His works, which were published in 1483, include 
<i>De Theologia Mystica Speculativa, De Theologia Mystica Practica, De 
Elucidatione Scholastica Mysticae Theologiae</i>, and many other 
treatises on philosophy, theology, and canon law.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Gerson was opposed equally to the formalism of the Scotists and to the 
terminism of the Ockamists. Indeed, he was opposed to all philosophy 
except in so far as philosophy is seasoned with piety. In a sermon, 
<i>De 
Omnibus Sanctis</i>, he condemns those self-dubbed philosophers who 
separate philosophy from the practice of religion, "qui se dici 
philosophos volunt, et non sunt, quoniam dum a religione secernere 
putant philosophiam, utramque perdunt."<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> In the treatise <i>De Mystica 
Theologia Speculativa</i> he  
 <!--
THE MYSTIC SCHOOL 413 
 --><A NAME="p413"></a>
 describes contemplative ecstasy after the manner and almost in the 
words of his favorite author, St. Bonaventure: "Est igitur extasis 
raptus mentis cum cessatione omnium operationum in inferioribus 
potentiis."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DENIS THE CARTHUSIAN<p>

<b>Life</b>. Denis the Carthusian,<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> <i>Doctor Ecstaticus</i>, was 
born at Ryckel, in the Belgian province of Limbourg, in 1402. After 
having obtained the degree of Master of Arts at Cologne, he entered the 
Carthusian monastery at Roermonde. He died in 1471. A complete edition 
of the works of the Carthusian is being published by the monks of Notre 
Dame des Pr&eacute;s. The eighteenth volume appeared in 1899.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Denis carefully avoids entering into the subtleties of the 
controversies which were agitating the schools in his day. 
"Impertinentes subtilitates vitare propono."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> In the main his system 
of philosophy and theology is Thomistic. He considers, however, all 
speculative knowledge to be merely an introduction to the interior life 
of contemplation and ecstasy. In the mystic elements of his system he 
draws largely from the Pseudo-Dionysius.<p>

<b>Heterodox Mystics</b>. The Averroism which prevailed during the 
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, whether openly professed as it was 
by <b>John of Gand</b> (or <b>John of Jandun</b>, erroneously called 
John of Ghent), or taught more covertly as it was in different forms by 
John De Mirecourt and Guido<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> of Medonta, took the form of an
 anti-Scholastic movement tending towards a revival of the pantheism of 
the twelfth century. A similar tendency towards pantheism led some of 
the mystics of this 
 <!--
414 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p414"></a>
 time to maintain the identity of the creature with the Creator in the 
act of contemplative ecstasy -- a doctrine which was repudiated by 
orthodox mystics. Some of the first heterodox mystics, such as Eckhart, 
show little or no trace of Averroistic influence; it was on the 
societies or brotherhoods of mystics that the Averroists brought their 
pantheistic doctrines to bear, thus widening the gulf between true and 
false mysticism.<p>

ECKHART<p>

Master Eckhart<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> (or Eckhardt) was born about the year 1260. He 
studied first at Cologne, and afterwards at Paris. He belonged to the 
order of St. Dominic. In 1326 the archbishop of Cologne instituted 
proceedings against Eckhart, who was then teaching in the convent of 
his order at Cologne. Eckhart repelled the charge of heresy, and in 
1327 appealed to the Holy See. He died in 1327. In 1329 twenty-eight 
propositions taken from his writings were condemned by John XXII.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

In his Latin work entitled <i>Opus Tripartitum</i>, and in his sermons, 
written in German, Eckhart advocated a system of mysticism in which he 
maintained the disappearance of all distinction between the Creator and 
the creature in the act of contemplation. He taught that the supreme 
happiness of man consists in a deification by which man becomes one 
with God.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Henry Suso</b> (died 1366) and <b>John Tauler</b> (1290-1361), who 
were influenced by Eckhart's mystic doctrines, prepared the way for the 
Protestant mysticism of <b>Sebastian Franck</b> (1500-1545), 
<b>Valentine Weigel</b> (1533-1588), and <b>Jakob B&ouml;hme</b>
 (1575-1624), which, together with the cabalistic mysticism of <b>John 
Reuchlin</b> (1455-1522), flourished in the Renaissance period.<p>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a></a> Fifteenth century writers, including Thomas himself (<i>cf.</i> 
<i>Opera</i>, ed. 1576, Vol. I, pp. 453 ff.), refer to the order as 
<i>Canonici Regulares Sancti Augustini, vulgo dicti Fratres</i>. It was 
Florentius, successor of Gerhard Groot, who founded the community at 
Agnetenberg, near Zwolle, where Thomas spent the greater part of his 
life. A recent work on Thomas &agrave; Kempis is Scully's <i>Life of 
Venerable Thomas &agrave; Kempis</i> (London, 1901).<p>
