<h3 align="center">CHAPTER LVII<br>
ENGLISH EMPIRICISM</h3><p>

The tendency of British philosophy has always been towards the 
positivistic and practical rather than towards the mystical and 
speculative. This trait we have already observed in the philosophy of 
Hobbes and Bacon. It reappeared during the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries in the critical and empirical philosophy of Locke, in the 
natural philosophy of Newton, and in the theological doctrines of the 
Deists. How the British moralists of the eighteenth century applied the 
principle of empiricism to ethical problems, will be seen in the next 
chapter.<p>

JOHN LOCKE<p>

<b>Life</b>. John Locke was born in 1632 at Wrington, near Bristol. In 
1646 he entered Westminster School and in 1652 he entered Christ 
Church, Oxford. Here, although he found Scholasticism still in the 
ascendency, he began to take an interest in Cartesian philosophy, and, 
while it is certainly incorrect to regard Locke's empiricism as an 
English branch of Cartesianism, there can be no doubt as to the 
important influence of this early study of Descartes on the 
philosophical career of Locke. On leaving Oxford Locke entered the 
household of Lord Ashley, afterwards Earl of Shaftesbury, as secretary, 
tutor, and physician. After the downfall and death of his patron Locke 
took up his residence in Holland (1683). There he remained until 1689, 
when he returned to England in the suite of William of Orange. He died 
at Oates, in Essex, in the year 1704.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Locke's works, which were first published in nine 
volumes (London, 1714), include the <i>Essay concerning Human 
Understanding, Thoughts concerning Education, Two Treatises on 
Government, The Reasonableness of Christianity as delivered in 
Scripture</i>, and other treatises. The best edition of the 
<i>Essay</i> is that of Alexander Campbell Fraser (2 vols., Clarendon 
Press, 1894). Manuals to be consulted: Fraser's <i>Locke</i> 
(Blackwood's Philosophical Classics, Edinburgh and Philadelphia, 1890) 
and Marion's <i>J. Locke, sa vie et son oeuvre</i> (Paris, 1893).<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup>
 <!--
LOCKE'S ANALYSIS OF EXPERIENCE 487  
 --><A NAME="p487"></a><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Starting Point</b>. All Locke's Philosophy centers in his theory of 
cognition, and his theory of cognition is based on the principle which 
may be enunciated negatively by saying that there are no innate ideas, 
or affirmatively by saying that all knowledge comes from experience.<p>

<i>There are no innate ideas</i>. The first book of the <b>Essay</b> is 
devoted to proving that "there are no innate principles in the mind." 
Locke observes that the universal acceptance of certain principles is 
taken as a proof of their innateness. He then proceeds to show that 
facts do not sustain the contention that the principles in question, 
or, indeed, any principles, are universally accepted. Children and 
uneducated persons are ignorant of the principles of identity and 
contradiction; the existence of atheism and polytheism demonstrates 
that the idea of God is not present in the minds of all men from the 
beginning and the well-known diversity of the moral ideals of different 
races and nations proves that the elementary principles of morality are 
not universally accepted. He further adduces positive evidence against 
the innateness of these principles, arguing that the ideas which 
compose them are abstract, and therefore do not appear in consciousness 
until a comparatively late period in the mental development of the 
individual. Here, as well as elsewhere Locke assumes that <i>to be in 
the mind</i> and <i>to be known</i> are one and the same.<p>

The mind, therefore, is in the beginning a blank sheet, or, to use the 
Aristotelian phrase, a <i>tabula rasa</i>. It remains to inquire how 
our ideas are acquired.<p>

<b>Analysis of Experience</b>. The second book of the <i>Essay</i> is 
devoted to the task of showing how our ideas originate by experience 
Experience, Locke teaches, is twofold: <i>sensation</i>, or the 
perception of external phenomena by means of the senses, and 
<i>reflection</i> or the perception of the internal phenomena, that 
 <!--
488 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p488"></a>
 is, of the activity of the understanding itself. From these two 
sources arise all our <i>ideas</i>. Now, our ideas are either 
<i>simple</i> or <i>complex</i>. Simple ideas are those which are 
"furnished" to the mind by sensation and reflection, the understanding 
itself remaining perfectly passive; complex ideas are those which the 
understanding "makes" by "repeating, comparing, and combining" simple 
ideas.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

(a) Simple ideas. Simple ideas are divided into four classes: 
(1) those which come into the mind by one sense only; (2) those which 
convey themselves into the mind by more senses than one; (3) those 
which are had from reflection only; (4) those which are suggested to 
the mind by all the ways of sensation and reflection. To the first 
class belong not only the ideas of color, taste, etc., but also that of 
solidity, or impenetrability. It is this quality, and not, as Descartes 
taught, extension, that is the primary attribute of body. To the second 
class belong our ideas of motion, space, etc. As examples of the third 
class Locke instances the ideas of thought and will, while to the last 
class he assigns our ideas of pleasure and power.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

With regard to the validity of simple ideas, Locke adopts Boyle's 
division of the qualities of bodies into primary and secondary. 
Secondary qualities, such as colors, tastes, etc., do not really exist 
in bodies; real existence can be attributed only to primary qualities, 
such as bulk, figure, motion, etc., which have the power to produce in 
us the simple ideas of secondary qualities. Here Locke fails to 
distinguish between the psychic and the physical aspect of secondary 
qualities, and from the undeniable fact that the quality of color, for 
example in its psychic aspect, exists in the mind alone, concludes 
that, in no true sense of the word, can color be said to exist outside 
the mind.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

(b) Complex ideas. In the twelfth chapter of the second book of the 
<i>Essay</i>, Locke divides complex ideas into three classes ideas of 
modes, ideas of substances, and ideas of relations. 
 <!--
A LOCKE'S DOCTRINE OF SUBSTANCE 489  
 --><A NAME="p489"></a><p>

(alpha) <i>Modes</i> are defined as "complex ideas which, however 
compounded, contain not in them the supposition of subsisting by 
themselves, but are considered as dependencies on or affections of 
substances." <i>Simple</i> modes are combinations of the same simple 
idea: thus, distance, surface, figure are modifications and 
combinations of the simple idea of space; duration, time, and eternity 
are simple modes of the idea of duration, while memory, reasoning, and 
judging are simple modes of the idea of thinking. <i>Mixed</i> modes 
are combinations of different kinds of simple ideas. For example, the 
idea of sacrilege or of murder is made up of the simple ideas of 
action, circumstance, motive, etc.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

(beta) <i>Substance</i>. Not being able to conceive how simple ideas 
can subsist by themselves, we form a complex idea of <i>substance</i> 
as the substratum which "upholds" them. Substance, then, is not 
primarily conceived as that which is capable of subsisting by itself, 
but rather as that which upholds or supports the qualities of 
things.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> Thus, the substance of the rose is the complex idea of that 
which upholds or supports the simple ideas, color, fragrance, softness, 
etc.<p>

Whatever Locke may have meant when he said that our idea of substance 
is obscure, his First Letter to the Bishop of Worcester removes all 
doubt as to his belief in the <i>real existence of substance</i>. 
Indeed, the letter explicitly distinguishes between our knowledge that 
substance is and our knowledge of what it is.<p>

Substance is threefold, -- <i>bodily, spiritual</i>, and <i>divine</i>. 
We have as clear an idea of spiritual substance as we have of bodily 
substance; for thought is as easily known as extension, and will is as 
easily known as impulsion or force. And the idea of divine substance 
offers no special difficulty; for it is merely the complex idea made up 
of our ideas of existence, power, knowledge, etc., to which is added 
the idea of infinite. The idea of infinite is obtained by the addition 
of finite to finite. 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 490 
 --><A NAME="p490"></a><p>

(gamma) <i>Relations</i>. A <i>relation</i> arises "when the mind so 
considers one thing that it does, as it were, bring it to, and set it 
by another, and carries its view from the one to the other."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup>
Relations are innumerable. Locke undertakes to discuss merely the 
principal relations, as, for example, causality and identity.<p>

Although Locke's analysis of the relation of <i>causality</i> seems 
unimportant when compared with Hume's more thorough analysis of the 
causal axiom, nevertheless the mere fact of reducing causality to a 
relation rather than to the category of substance or action is a 
revolution in philosophy. Locke defines a <i>cause</i> as that which 
produces, and an <i>effect</i> as that which is produced. He does not, 
therefore, reduce causality to mere sequence; he teaches that there are 
real causes as there are real substances.<p>

The relation of <i>identity</i> arises "when, considering anything as 
existing at any determined time and place, we compare it with itself 
existing at another time."<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Locke teaches that the principle of 
individuation is existence itself; but as the existence of living 
bodies is not the same as that of mere masses of matter, the identity 
of living bodies is the permanence of organization, while the identity 
of a mere mass of matter is the identity of its aggregated particles 
(atoms). <i>Personal identity</i> (the identity of man) is the 
continuity of consciousness. Locke apparently fails to distinguish 
between the psychological and the ontological aspect of the problem of 
personality, -- between the question, How is personal identity known? 
and the question, How is personal identity constituted?<p>

<b>Philosophy of Language</b>. In the third book of the <i>Essay</i> 
Locke treats of the philosophy of language. Words do not, as is 
generally supposed, signify things. Neither do they, in their primary 
or immediate signification, stand for ideas common to all men, but 
merely for the ideas in the mind of him who uses them. Now, it is 
impossible that every particular thing should have its own name; 
indeed, "the greatest part of words are 
 <!--
LOCKE'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 491 
 --><A NAME="p491"></a>
 general terms" used to express general ideas. The generality and 
universality of names and ideas are, therefore, mere creatures and 
inventions of the understanding and belong not to the existence of 
things (nominalism). Locke considers, in particular, the relation of 
our universal ideas to the essences of things, pointing out the 
distinction between <i>nominal</i> and <i>real</i> essences. Real 
essence is "the very being of anything, whereby it is what it is"; 
nominal essence is "the abstract idea which the general name stands 
for."<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> Thus, the real essence of gold is that which makes gold to be 
what it is (the "substantial form" of Aristotle and the schoolmen), 
while the nominal essence is the complex idea of the color, weight, 
malleability, etc., of gold. Now we can and do know the nominal 
essences of material substances, but, as to real essences, although we 
know that they exist we cannot know what they are; for we have no means 
of judging whether the real essence which constitutes the "insensible" 
parts of gold is like the nominal essence, which is the complex idea 
including yellow, malleable, etc. We know the surface qualities of 
things, but we are no more competent to judge what the real essence is 
than the countryman who sees the exterior of the clock at Strasburg and 
hears it strike is competent to judge of the mechanism with which the 
clock is provided.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> Locke grants that the qualities which constitute 
the nominal essence are produced by the real essence, but apparently 
overlooks the principle that, by virtue of the similarity of effect to 
cause, we may proceed from the knowledge of the effect to the knowledge 
of the cause.<p>

<b>Theory of Knowledge</b>. The fourth book of the <i>Essay</i> is 
devoted to the study of the extent and validity of knowledge. Knowledge 
is defined<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> as "the perception of the connexion of and agreement or 
disagreement and repugnance of our ideas." It is of three kinds, -- 
<i>intuitive, demonstrative</i>, and <i>sensitive</i>. <i>Intuitive</i> 
knowledge is "the perception of the agreement or 
 <!--
492 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p492"></a>
 disagreement of two ideas immediately by themselves without the 
intervention of any other." It is by means of this knowledge that we 
perceive that three equals one and two, and it is on the same kind of 
knowledge that the certainty and evidence of all our knowledge 
depend.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> <i>Demonstrative</i> knowledge is the perception of the 
agreement or disagreement of two ideas by the intervention of other 
ideas, as, for example, the perception of the agreement of the sum of 
the three angles of a triangle and two right angles. <i>Sensitive</i> 
knowledge is "the perception of the particular existence of finite 
beings without us."<p>

Intuitive knowledge is the basis of all certitude; demonstrative 
knowledge is less clear than intuitive knowledge, and, therefore, 
inferior to it; but demonstrative knowledge is, in turn, superior to 
sensitive knowledge. Yet, while rating sensitive knowledge so low, and 
describing it as "going beyond bare probability," Locke does not deny 
the validity of sensitive knowledge when it testifies to the existence 
of external things.<p>

Our knowledge of our own existence is intuitive; our knowledge of the 
existence of God is demonstrative; and our knowledge of other things is 
sensitive.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Moral and Political Doctrines</b>.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> Locke's ethical and political 
doctrines bear the general character of his theoretical speculations
 -- they aim at being empirical. There are <i>four determinants of 
moral good</i>: reason, the will of God, the general good, and
 self-interest. To each of these in turn Locke appeals without 
determining the relations of one to the others.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> In his treatises on 
political government he <i>combats the principles of state 
absolutism</i>, maintaining that natural rights were in no way 
abrogated by the transition of primitive man from the state of nature 
to the conditions of political life. He defends the  
 <!--
HISTORICAL POSITION OF LOCKE 493
 --><A NAME="p493"></a>
 constitutional theory, advocates the supremacy of the legislative 
power, and teaches that, in a conflict between the legislative and the 
executive powers, the will of the nation is supreme, because, in such 
an event, sovereign authority reverts to the source whence it is 
derived, namely the people. Locke is commonly regarded as the founder 
of that philosophy of civil government which inspired the great modern 
movements towards popular representation, the extension of the rights 
of subjects, and the restriction of monarchical privileges.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Locke is commonly styled the successor of 
Bacon and Hobbes, although it is sometimes denied that he was 
influenced directly by the writings of either of these philosophers. 
The man, however, who exercised the greatest influence on Locke was 
Descartes.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> This influence was indirect as well as direct. Thus, 
Locke begins his <i>Essay</i> by denying the innateness of ideas, -- a 
distinctive]y Cartesian doctrine; and throughout his inquiry into the 
nature and value of knowledge he is constantly denying what Descartes 
affirmed, and affirming what Descartes denied. And yet the cardinal 
idea of Cartesianism, namely the antithesis between mind and matter, 
appears as a tacit assumption in Locke's inquiry, and underlies 
everything that Locke wrote concerning human knowledge.<p>

Locke's original contribution to philosophy may be described by saying 
that he introduced the critical spirit. For him the paramount problem 
was to determine the nature, value, and extent of human knowledge, and 
the method which he employed was the empirical rather than the 
rational, or deductive. He applied to the study of the mind the method 
which Bacon advocated as best suited to the study of nature. The result 
which he reached was the establishment of an empiricism which is, in 
ultimate analysis, a system of sensism. His chief defect is 
superficiality, -- a defect common to his school. He stopped where 
the real problems of philosophy begin, and although, as 
 <!--
494 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p494"></a>
 the subsequent development of empiricism in France has shown, his 
premises led inevitably to materialism, he himself maintained, with 
characteristic inconsistency, the spirituality of the human soul and 
the existence of purely spiritual substances.<p>

NEWTON<p>

Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) is the most important representative of 
the scientific phase of the English empiricism of the seventeenth 
century. His chief works are <i>Philosophiae Naturalis Principia 
Mathematica</i> (1687) and <i>Opticks</i> (1704). The philosophical 
importance of his discovery of the law and theory of universal 
gravitation lies in this, -- that it established the fact that the 
physical laws which hold good on the surface of the earth are valid 
throughout the universe, as far as we can know anything about it.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup><p>

THE DEISTIC CONTROVERSY<p>

Before the time of Locke, <b>Lord Herbert of Cherbury</b> (1581-1648) 
had advocated a naturalistic philosophy of religion, thus planting the 
seed of the deistic doctrines which appeared after the days of Locke 
and found a congenial soil in English empiricism. <i>Deism</i> may be 
described as a movement tending to free religious thought from the 
control of authority. Its chief thesis is that there is a <i>universal 
natural religion</i>, the principal tenet of which is, "Believe in God 
and do your duty"; that positive religion is the creation of cunning 
rulers and crafty priests; that Christianity, in its original form, was 
a simple though perfect expression of natural religion; and that 
whatever is <i>positive</i> in Christianity is a useless and harmful 
accretion. These principles naturally provoked opposition on the part 
of the defenders of Christianity, and there resulted a controversy 
between the deists,  
 <!--
BRITISH DEISTS AND MORALISTS 495 
 --><A NAME="p495"></a>
 or <i>freethinkers</i>, as they were called, and the representatives 
of orthodoxy.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup><p>

To the deistic side of the argument <b>John Toland</b> (1670-1722) 
contributed <i>Christianity not Mysterious</i>; <b>Anthony Collins</b> 
(1676-1729), a <i>Discourse on Freethinking</i>; <b>Matthew Tindal</b> 
(1657-1733) <i>Christianity as old as the Creation</i>; and <b>Thomas 
Chubb</b> (1679-1747), <i>The True Gospel of Jesus Christ</i>. 
<b>Thomas Morgan</b> (died 1743), author of <i>The Moral 
Philosopher</i>, and, according to some, Henry St. John, Viscount 
<b>Bolingbroke</b> (1678-1751), are also to be reckoned among the 
deistic opponents of Christianity.<p>

Chief among the defenders of Christianity were <b>Samuel Clarke</b> 
(1675-1729), who is best known by his controversy with Leibniz 
concerning space and time, <b>William Wollaston</b> (1659-1724), 
<b>George Berkeley</b> (1685-1753), <b>Joseph Butler</b> (1692-1752), 
author of the <i>Analogy of Religion</i>, and George Campbell
 (1719-1796).<p>

While this controversy was being waged, the principles of empiricism 
were being applied to psychology by the founders of the association 
school, and to ethical problems by the founders of the British schools 
of morals. As we shall have occasion to return to the beginnings of the 
association school when we come to deal with the English philosophy of 
the nineteenth century, we shall now take up the study of the British 
schools of morals.<p>
