GERBERT</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. Gerbert was born in Aquitaine, about the middle of the 
tenth century. He became a monk at the monastery of Aurillac, and 
there, according to Richer, a contemporary and disciple, he met the 
count of Barcelona, with whom he went to Spain in order to study 
mathematics and the physical sciences. Thence, at the request of Otho 
II, he went to Rome. From Rome he went back to France, and in 991 
became archbishop of Rheims. In 997 he was transferred to the see of 
Ravenna. In 999 he became pope, taking the name of Sylvester II. He 
lived until 1003.<p>

Gerbert is credited with being the first to introduce the Arabic 
numerals into Christian Europe.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> He is said also to have constructed 
clocks and other

 mechanical contrivances. It was probably his acquaintance with 
astronomy and his success as a mechanical inventor that earned for him 
the reputation of magician. The legends collected and published by 
Benno in the eleventh century represent Gerbert as in league with the 
devil. The less ignorant, however, among Gerbert's contemporaries 
acknowledged him to be a pious monk and a man of extraordinary 
learning.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Migne, in his <i>Patrologia Latina</i>, Vol. CXXXIX, 
publishes the following works of Gerbert: <i>Libellus de Numerorum 
Divisione; De Geometria; De Sphaerae Constrictione</i>; and <i>Libellus 
de Rationali et Ratione Uti</i>. Gerbert's letters were published by 
Masson in 611, and republished by Duchesne in 1636. Richer's 
<i>Histories</i>, which throw so much light on the life and character 
of Gerbert as well as on some important points of his doctrine, were 
first published by Pertz in the <i>Monumenta Germaniae</i>.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> To these 
sources must be added a poem by Adalbero, published in the 
<i>Patrologia Latina</i>, Vol. CXLI, and a letter of Leo, abbot and 
papal legate, which is found in Vol. CXXXIX of the <i>Patrologia 
Latina</i>. The work <i>De Corpore et Sanguine Domini</i>, attributed 
to Gerbert by Pertz and others, is of doubtful authenticity.<p>

An excellent monograph of the life and teaching of Gerbert is M. 
Picavet's <i>Gerbert, un pape philosophe</i> (Paris, 1897). <i>cf.</i> 
<i>Catholic University Bulletin</i>, Vol. IV, pp. 295 ff. (July, 1898).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Gerbert as a Teacher</b>. In the midst of the wars and other 
external circumstances which combined to bring about a state of almost 
universal neglect of learning, Gerbert revived at the school of Rheims 
the best traditions of the early days of the Scholastic movement. He 
taught the dialectic of Aristotle, using a translation of the 
<i>Categoriae</i> in addition to the <i>Isagoge</i> of Porphyry and the 
commentaries of Boethius. He also taught rhetoric, employing, it is 
said, a mechanical contrivance in order to express the different 
combinations of figures of speech, and in one of his letters he speaks 
of a sphere by means  
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p259"></a>
 of which he illustrated "the horizon and the beauties of the heavens." 
His work <i>De Divisione Numerorum</i> shows that he occupied himself 
with the task of popularizing the theory of multiplication.<p>

<b>Gerbert as a Philosopher</b>. 1. Richer, a contemporary and disciple 
of Gerbert, gives a most interesting description of an encounter which 
took place at Ravenna in the year 980 between Gerbert, master of the 
schools at Rheims, and Otric, the most famous of the masters of the 
German schools. The Emperor, Otho II, and many distinguished prelates 
lent solemnity to the scene by their presence. Gerbert opened the 
discussion by defining philosophy as "divinarum et humanarum rerum 
comprehensio veritatis," thus identifying philosophy with knowledge. 
Then he proceeded to divide philosophy into theoretical and practical. 
He further distinguished physics, mathematics, and theology 
(<i>theologia intellectibilis</i>) as parts of theoretical philosophy, 
and moral (<i>dispensativa</i>), economic (<i>distributiva</i>), and 
political (<i>civilis</i>) philosophy as subdivisions of practical 
philosophy. After a discussion as to the place which physiology and 
philology should occupy in this classification of philosophical 
sciences, the disputants passed on to the question, "What is the <i>aim 
of philosophy</i>?" Gerbert answered that the final cause of 
philosophical study is a knowledge of things human and divine, in other 
words, that philosophy is, so to speak, its own reward. At this point 
the argument veered round to the Platonic account of <i>the cause of 
the world</i>. Next the disputants took up the discussion of the cause 
of shadows, and when, at the close of the day's debate, the Emperor put 
an end to the disputation, the question under discussion was whether 
<i>mortal</i> is to be subordinate to <i>rational</i> or vice versa, 
or, as we should say, whether the term <i>mortal</i> or the term 
<i>rational</i> has the greater extension.<p>

2. The <i>Libellus de Rationali et Ratione Uti</i>, addressed to the 
Emperor, takes up <i>the problem of predication</i> at the point where 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 260 
 --><A NAME="p260"></a>
 the oral discussion had been interrupted, and inquires whether 
<i>ratione uti</i> should be predicated of <i>rationale</i>. It was a 
principle admitted by dialecticians that the predicate should possess 
wider extension than the subject; since, therefore, <i>reasonable</i> 
is of wider extension than <i>using reason</i>, is not Porphyry wrong 
when he says that <i>using reason</i> may be predicated of 
<i>reasonable</i>? Gerbert approaches the problem by stating the 
objections which may be urged from three sources, namely, from the 
relation of <i>power</i> to <i>act</i>, from the relation of the 
<i>accidental</i> to the <i>substantial</i>, and from the relation of 
the <i>higher concept</i> to the <i>lower</i>. He then proceeds to 
elucidate these notions, determining the nature of act and power, thus 
using the objections in order to throw light on the problem, so that 
when he comes to the thesis that <i>ratione uti</i> may be predicated 
of <i>rationale</i> he has no difficulty in proving his proposition by 
the use of the concepts, act, power, etc., on which the objections 
rested.<p>

This little treatise is, therefore, the first sample of the use of the 
<i>Scholastic method</i>, which, a century later, was employed in 
Abelard's <i>Sic et Non</i>, and was perfected by the philosophers of 
the thirteenth century. It is by reason of its method rather than of 
its contents that the treatise occupies so important a place in the 
history of Scholastic philosophy.<p>

3. <i>Adalbero</i>, who was at one time a disciple of Gerbert at 
Rheims, and who died in 1030, mentions in a poem addressed to Robert II 
of France certain theories concerning the origin of the universe and 
adds, "I found these things, being not unmindful of what I have heard." 
If the theories in question are those of Gerbert, and it is natural to 
suppose that Adalbero is speaking of his former teacher, it is evident 
that our philosopher did not confine his philosophical teaching to the 
problems of dialectic, but that he carried his inquiries into the 
region of cosmogony and anthropology.<p>

4. The letter of Leo, the papal legate appointed to inquire into the 
rival claims of Gerbert and Arnoulf to the see of Rheims, 
 <!--
THE SCHOOL OF AUXERRE 261 
 --><A NAME="p261"></a>
 bears further testimony to the many-sidedness of Gerbert's teaching. 
It implies that Gerbert included in his curriculum the study of nature 
and, perhaps, the study of animal life. This is all the more remarkable 
when we recall that Gerbert belonged to an age to which Aristotle's 
treatises on the natural sciences were completely unknown.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Gerbert must have exercised considerable 
influence on his own generation. The very grotesqueness of the notions 
which the superstitious entertained concerning him is proof of his 
preeminence. He is in the tenth century what Erigena was in the ninth 
and what Abelard will be in the twelfth. His influence, however, was 
exercised by his oral teaching rather than by his written works. To his 
disciples, and to the masters who succeeded him in the schools in 
France, the dialectical movement which was continued by Roscelin, 
Abelard, and St. Anselm, and by them transmitted to the thirteenth 
century, owes a larger debt than can be accurately determined.<p>
