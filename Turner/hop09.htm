<h3 align="center">CHAPTER IX<br>
PLATO</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. Plato was born at Athens some years after the beginning of 
the Peloponnesian War. The exact year of his birth is unknown, but 427 
or 428 B.C. is the most probable date. His father's name was Aristo; 
his mother, Perictione, was descended from Dropides, a near relative of 
Solon. Plato was originally called Aristocles, <b>Plat&ocirc;n</b> 
being a nickname given by his master in gymnastics on account of his 
broad build.<p>

Concerning his early life we do not possess much reliable information. 
We may, however, presume that he profited by all the educational 
advantages that were within the reach of a noble and wealthy Athenian 
youth. Zeller<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> calls attention to three circumstances which had a 
determining influence on the development of Plato's mind. The first of 
these was the political condition of Athens. The city was just then 
experiencing the full effects of demagogic rule, and the conditions at 
home and abroad were such that the mind of the aristocratic young 
student naturally turned towards idealistic schemes of state 
organization, schemes which were later to find expression in <i>The 
Republic</i>. The second circumstance is the fact that in early life 
Plato devoted much attention to poetry, composing poems of no mean 
artistic value. These early studies were not without effect on his 
philosophy; they influenced the entire spirit of his system as well as 
the language, so remarkable for its grace and beauty, in which that 
system was set forth. Indeed, it is true, in a sense, that Plato became 
a philosopher without ceasing to be a poet. The circumstance, however, 
which was most decisive in determining the life and philosophy of Plato 
was the personal influence of Socrates; for though he had studied the 
doctrines of Heraclitus under Cratylus, his philosophical training may 
be said to date from his first meeting with Socrates. 
 <!--
94 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p94"></a><p>

After the death of Socrates, Plato, who had spent about eight years as 
disciple, began his travels preparatory to establishing a school of his 
own. He first repaired to Megara,<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> where some of the disciples of 
Socrates were gathered under the leadership of Euclid. Thence he went 
to Italy to obtain a more intimate acquaintance with the doctrines of 
the Pythagoreans. The exact order of his subsequent journeys is not 
certain still, there is no reason to doubt that he visited Egypt, 
although the tales that are told of the vast stores of learning which 
he acquired in that country are far from reliable. We may accept as 
true the story of his journeys to Sicily, and of his relations with the 
elder Dionysius, who sold him into slavery, as well as with Dionysius 
the younger, whom he tried to convert to his Utopian scheme of state 
government.<p>

It was after his first journey to Sicily that Plato began his career at 
Athens as a teacher. Imitating his master, Socrates, he gathered round 
him the young men of the city, but, unlike Socrates, he refused to 
teach in the public squares, preferring the retirement of the groves 
near the gymnasium of Academus. There he met his disciples, conversing 
with them after the manner of Socrates, though it is natural to suppose 
that in his style as well as in his choice of illustrations he departed 
from the Socratic example of studied plainness. On his return from his 
third journey to Sicily, Plato took up his residence permanently in 
Athens, and thenceforth devoted himself unremittingly to teaching and 
writing. He lived to the age of eighty, dying in the midst of his 
intellectual labors. If Cicero's story be true,<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> he died in the act of 
writing; according to another tradition prevalent in ancient times, he 
died at a wedding feast.<p>

<b>Plato's Character</b>. Even in antiquity, the character of Plato was 
violently assailed. His dealings with Socrates and afterwards with his 
own disciples, his visits to Sicily, his references to the 
philosophical systems of his predecessors, were all made the pr../resource 
for accusations of self-assertion, tyranny, flattery of tyrants, 
plagiarism, and willful misrepresentation. His aristocratic ways and 
his disdain of the ostentatious asceticism of the Cynics served as the 
basis for charges of love of pleasure and immorality. The evidence on 
which all these accusations rests is of the flimsiest nature, while, on 
the contrary, everything that Plato wrote bears testimony to the lofty 
nobility of the man. The truth is that Plato's character was not easily 
understood. When the idealism and poetic temperament which were his by 
instinct and early training broke loose from the restraint of Socratic
 <!--
PLATO'S WRITINGS 95 
 --><A NAME="p95"></a>
 influence, he was merely realizing in his personal character the ideal 
of Greek life -- an ideal which, by reason of its many-sidedness, was 
a contradiction and a scandal to the narrow-minded advocates of 
asceticism and abstemiousness. The importance which Plato attached to a 
larger culture was taken by the Cynics and his other adversaries as a 
sign that he had abandoned, whereas he was in reality but rounding out 
and perfecting, the Socratic idea of what a philosopher ought to be.<p>

Plato's Writings.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> We are fortunate in possessing all the genuine 
works of Plato. The so-called Platonic dialogues which are spoken of as 
lost are certainly spurious. The <i>Divisions</i> mentioned by 
Aristotle is neither a Platonic nor an Aristotelian treatise; the 
<b>agrapha dogmata</b>, of which Aristotle also makes mention, is most 
likely a collection of the views which Plato himsell had not committed 
to writing, but which some disciple collected for the use of the 
school.<p>

While nothing that Plato wrote has been lost, it is by no means easy to 
determine how many of the thirty-six dialogues that have come down to 
us are undoubtedly authentic. With respect to <i>Phaedrus, Protagoras, 
The Banquet, Gorgias, The Republic, Timaeus, Thaetetus</i>, and 
<i>Phaedo</i> , there can be no reasonable doubt. Others, like 
<i>Parmenides, Cratylus, The Sophist</i>, are not so certainly genuine; 
while in the case of <i>Minos, Hipparchus</i>, etc., the balance of 
evidence is against their authenticity.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Next comes the question of the <i>order</i> or <i>plan</i> of the 
Platonic dialogues. Ueberweg mentions the three principal theories held 
by scholars. They are (1) that Plato wrote according to a definite 
plan, composing first the <i>elementary</i> dialogues, then the 
<i>mediatory</i>, and finally the <i>constructive</i> discourses; (2) 
that he had no definite plan, but that the dialogues represent the 
different stages in the development of his mind; (3) that he 
deliberately portrayed in his dialogues the several stages in the life 
of Socrates, the ideal philosopher. Zeller, however, very sensibly 
remarks<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> that the question has been argued too much on <i>a 
priori</i> grounds, and suggests that the first thing to do is to 
determine the order in which the dialogues were written -- a task that 
is by no means easy.  
 <!--
96 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p96"></a><p>

The form of the Platonic writings is, as is well known, the dialogue; 
the reasons why Plato adopted this literary form are not far to seek. 
In the first place, he was influenced by the Socratic method; secondly, 
he was poet enough to recognize the dramatic effect of which the 
dialogue is capable, and the room which it affords for local coloring 
and portrayal of character. Finally, he must have recognized that the 
dialogue afforded him the amplest opportunity of presenting the life of 
the model philosopher in the words and acts of the idealized Socrates. 
Philosophy was for Plato a matter of life as well as of thought; "true 
philosophy, therefore, could only be represented in the perfect 
philosopher, in the personality, words, and demeanor of Socrates."<p>

The Platonic dialogue has been well described as occupying a middle 
position between the personal converse of Socrates and the purely 
scientific continuous exposition of Aristotle.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Plato, adopting a 
stricter idea of method than Socrates adopted, excludes the personal 
and contingent elements which made the discourse of Socrates so 
picturesque; while at times, when he explains the more difficult points 
of doctrine, he abandons almost altogether the inductive method for the 
deductive, the dialogue well-nigh disappears and gives way to unbroken 
discourse. This is especially true of the <i>Timaeus</i>.<p>

In his use of the dialogue, Plato constantly has recourse to the myth 
as a form of expression. The poetical and artistic value of the myth is 
conceded by all, but it offers no small difficulty when there is 
question of the philosophical doctrine which it was meant to convey. 
Whatever may have been Plato's purpose in introducing the myth, --  
whether it was to elucidate by concrete imagery some abstract 
principle, or to mislead the unthinking populace as to his religious 
convictions, or to conceal the contradictions of his thought, striving 
to "escape philosophical criticism by seeking refuge in the license of 
the poet," -- there can be no doubt that the myth was intended to be a 
mere allegory, and Plato himself warns us against taking such 
allegories for truth, the shadow for the substance.<p>

PLATO'S PHILOSOPHY<p>

<b>Definition of Philosophy</b>. Plato's philosophy is essentially a 
completion and extension of the philosophy of Socrates. What Socrates 
laid down as a principle of knowledge, Plato enunciates as a principle 
of Being; the Socratic concept, which was 
 <!--
PLATO'S DEFINITION OF PHILOSOPHY 97 
 --><A NAME="p97"></a>
 epistemological, is succeeded by the Platonic Idea, which is a 
metaphysical notion. Socrates taught that knowledge through concepts is 
the only true knowledge; therefore, concludes Plato, the concept, or 
the Idea, is the only true reality. Thus, for Plato, philosophy is the 
science of the Idea, or, as we should say, of the unconditioned basis 
of phenomena.<p>

In the <i>Phaedrus</i><sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Plato describes how the soul, at sight of 
singular phenomena, is moved to a remembrance of its heavenly home 
and of the archetypes which it contemplated in a previous existence, 
and of which it now beholds the imperfect copies. Thereupon, the soul, 
falling into an ecstasy of delight, wonders at the contrast between the 
Idea (archetype) and the phenomenon (copy), and from this wonder 
proceeds the impulse to philosophize, which is identical with the 
impulse to love. For, while it is true that there is a contrast between 
every Idea and its phenomenon, the contrast is more striking in the 
case of the <i>Idea of the beautiful</i>, this Idea shining through its 
visible copies more perfectly than any other Idea. Philosophy, then, 
is the effort of the human mind to rise from the contemplation of 
visible copies of Ideas to the knowledge of Ideas themselves.<p>

To the question, How is this knowledge of Ideas to be attained? Plato 
answers, By means of dialectic -- to this all other training is 
preliminary. Plato, moreover, is careful to distinguish between 
<i>knowledge</i> (<b>epist&ecirc;m&ecirc;</b>) and <i>opinion</i> 
(<b>doxa</b>), -- so that, when he defines philosophy as knowledge, we 
must understand him to speak of knowledge in the stricter sense of the 
term.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Division of Plato's Philosophy</b>. Plato, unlike Aristotle, neither 
distinguished between the different parts of philosophy, nor made each 
part the subject of a separate treatise. Still, the doctrines found in 
the dialogues may be classed under the three heads of <i>Dialectic, 
Physics, and Ethics</i> -- a division which, according to Cicero, was 
made by Plato himself, although it is more probable 
 <!--
98 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p98"></a>
 that it was first formulated by Xenocrates, as Sextus<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> says. Under 
the title <i>Dialectic</i> it is customary to include not only logic, 
but also the doctrine of Ideas. Under the division <i>Physics</i> are 
comprised Plato's doctrine concerning the world of phenomena in 
general, his teaching regarding the relation between Idea and 
phenomenon, his cosmogenetic theories, his notions of matter, space, 
and so forth. Finally, under <i>Ethics</i> are included not only 
questions which belong to the science of morals, but also the political 
doctrines which play so important a part in the Platonic system.<p>

<b>Dialectic</b>.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> It would be idle to look to Plato for a system of 
logic. We find, indeed, that he mentions certain laws of thought, but 
he enunciates them as laws of being, making them serve a metaphysical 
rather than a logical purpose.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> It is owing, perhaps, to this 
tendency of Plato's mind towards the metaphysical view that definition 
and division receive more of his attention than do the other problems 
of logic; dialectic, he teaches, is concerned (as is every part of 
philosophy) with the Idea, or, more explicitly, dialectic has for its 
object to reduce what is manifold and multiple in our experience of 
phenomena to that unity of concept which belongs to a knowledge of 
Ideas, and, furthermore, to establish an organic order among the 
concepts thus acquired. Dialectic has, therefore, the double task of 
defining universal concepts by <i>induction</i> 
(<b>sunag&ocirc;g&ecirc;</b>) and classifying them by <i>division</i> 
(<b>diairesis</b>).<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Definition and division together with some remarks on the problem of 
language are the only logical doctrines to be found in the dialogues. 
Dialectic, however, includes, besides logical doctrines, the theory of 
Ideas, which is the center of all Platonic thought; for dialectic is 
the doctrine of the Idea in itself, just as physics is the doctrine of 
the Idea imitated in nature, or as 
 <!--
PLATO'S THEORY OF IDEAS 99 
 --><A NAME="p99"></a>
 ethics is the doctrine of the Idea imitated in human action. Under the 
title of <i>Dialectic</i>, therefore, the theory of Ideas is studied; it 
includes the following questions: <i>(1) origin of the theory of Ideas; 
(2) nature and objective existence of the Ideas; (3) their expansion 
into plurality: formation of the world of Ideas.</i><p>

1. <i>Origin of the theory of Ideas</i>. The theory of Ideas, as has 
been remarked above, is a natural development of the Socratic doctrine 
of concepts. Knowledge, as distinct from opinion, is the knowledge of 
reality. Now, Socrates taught that in order to know a thing it is 
necessary and sufficient to have a concept of that thing. Therefore, 
the concept, or Idea, is the only reality.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> To deny that the Idea is a 
reality is to deny the possibility of scientific knowledge.<p>

Such is the first and most immediate derivation of the theory of Ideas. 
Starting from Socratic premises, Plato argues that the theory of Ideas 
is the only explanation of the objective value of scientific knowledge. 
Elsewhere, however, as in the <i>Philebus</i>,<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> he derives the 
doctrine of Ideas from the failure of Heraclitus and the Eleatics to 
explain Being and Becoming. Heraclitus was right in teaching that 
Becoming exists; he was wrong in teaching that Being does not exist. 
The Eleatics, on the contrary, were right in teaching that Being is, 
but they were wrong in teaching that Becoming is not. The truth is that 
both Being and Becoming exist. When, however, we come to analyze  
Becoming we find that it is made up of Being and not-Being. 
Consequently, in the changing world around us, that alone is real which 
is unchangeable, absolute, one, namely the Idea. For example, the 
concrete, changeable just is made up partly of what we would call the 
contingent element, the element of imperfection, of not-Being, and 
partly of the one immutable Idea, justice, which alone possesses real 
being. To say, then, that the Idea of <i>justice</i> does not exist is 
to say that <i>the just</i> (a just man  
 <!--
100 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p100"></a>
 or a just action) is all not-Being and has no reality. And what is 
said of justice may be said of any other Idea. The Idea is the core of 
reality underlying the surface qualities which are imperfections, 
<i>i.e.</i>, unrealities.<p>

Thus the reality of Being and the reality of scientific knowledge 
demand the existence of the Idea, and this <i>double aspect</i> of the 
Idea is never absent from Plato's thought: the Idea is a necessary 
postulate if we maintain, as we must maintain, the reality of 
scientific knowledge and the reality of Being. These are the two 
roads that lead to the Idea, -- the Socratic doctrine of concepts and 
the problem of Being and Becoming, a problem that was stated, though 
not satisfactorily solved, by Heraclitus and the Eleatics.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Besides these philosophical principles which led to the theory of 
Ideas, there existed in the mind of Plato what may be called a 
temperamental predisposition to adopt some such theory as the doctrine 
of Ideas and by means of it to explain knowledge and reality; for Plato 
was a poet and in him the <i>artistic sense</i> was always predominant. 
He was a Greek of the Greeks, and the Greek even in his mythology loved 
clearly cut, firmly outlined forms, definite, visible shapes. It was 
natural, therefore, for Plato not merely to distinguish in things the 
permanent element which is their Being and the object of our knowledge, 
but also to extract, as it were, this element from the manifold and 
changeable in which it was embedded, and to hypostatize it, causing it 
to stand out in a world of its own, in all its oneness and definiteness 
and immutability.<p>

2. <i>The nature and objective existence of the Ideas</i>. From what 
has been said, it is clear that the Idea is the element of reality in 
things -- the one uniform, immutable element, unaffected by 
multiplicity, change, and partial not-Being. The expressions which 
Plato uses to describe the Idea always imply one or several of these 
attributes. For instance, he calls it 
 <!--
PLATO'S THEORY OF IDEAS 101 
 --><A NAME="p101"></a><p>

<b>ousia, aidios ousia, ont&ocirc;s on, pantel&ocirc;s on, kata tauta 
on, aei kata tauta echon akin&ecirc;t&ocirc;s</b>, etc. The name, 
however, by which the Idea is most commonly designated is <b>eidos</b>, 
or <b>idea</b>, which primarily denotes something objective, though in 
a secondary sense the Platonic Idea is also an idea in our meaning of 
the word, a concept by which the object is known. But whether the Idea 
be considered subjectively or objectively, -- and the objective aspect 
is always to be considered first, -- it is essentially universal, or, 
to use Aristotle's phrase, <b>hen epi poll&ocirc;n</b>. We may call it 
the <i>universal essence</i> if we are careful to dissociate from the 
word <i>essence</i> the meaning of something existing in things; for 
nothing is clearer than that Plato understood by the Idea something 
existing apart from (<b>ch&ocirc;ris</b>) the phenomena which make up 
the world of sense. The Idea transcends the world of concrete 
existence; it abides in the heavenly sphere, the <b>topos noetos</b>, 
where the gods and the souls of the blessed contemplate it. It is 
described in the <i>Phaedrus</i><sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> as follows: "Now of the heaven 
which is above the heavens no earthly poet has ever sung or ever will 
sing in a worthy manner. I must tell, for I am bound to speak truly 
when speaking of truth. The colorless and formless and intangible 
essence is visible to the mind, which is the only lord of the soul. 
Circling this in the region above the heavens is the place of true 
knowledge." In <i>The Banquet</i><sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> the Idea of beauty is described 
"beauty only, absolute, <i>separate</i>, simple, and everlasting." 
There can be no doubt, therefore, that Plato separated the world of 
Ideas from the world of concrete existence. He hypostatized, so to 
speak, the Idea, and it was against this separation 
(<b>ch&ocirc;rizein</b>) of the Idea that Aristotle directed his 
criticism of Plato's theory. According to Aristotle, the Platonic world 
of Ideas is a world by itself, a prototype of the world which  
we see, and in this interpretation Aristotle is supported and 
sustained by all the later Scholastics. It is no longer seriously 
 <!--
102 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p102"></a>
 maintained that the Platonic Ideas exist merely in the human mind. 
More worthy of consideration is the view of St. Augustine, who, 
following the example of early Christian Platonists, identifies the 
world of Platonic Ideas with <i>the mind of God</i>. This view, 
supported as it is by the authority of some of the greatest of 
Christian philosophers as well as by that of the later Platonists and 
of all the Neo-Platonists, is not lightly to be set aside. On the other 
hand, the statements of Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> are explicit, and we must remember 
that Aristotle was an immediate disciple of Plato; we have no reason to 
suppose that he willfully misrepresented his master in this most 
important point, and we have every reason to believe that he was fully 
capable of understanding his master's teaching.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup><p>

So far the Idea has been described as the objective correlative of our 
universal concept; but while the universality of our concepts is a 
product of dialectical thought, the universality of the Idea is 
<i>objective</i>, that is, independent of the human mind. This 
objective universality is explained in the <i>Sophist</i>,<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> in which 
Plato attacks the Eleatic doctrine of the oneness of Being, maintaining 
that the Idea is at the same time <i>one</i> and <i>many</i>. But how 
are the unity and multiplicity of the Idea to be reconciled? Plato 
answers that they are reconciled by the <i>community</i> 
(<b>koin&ocirc;nia</b>) <i>of concepts</i>. As a concept, for example 
Being, is differentiated into its determinations, such as motion and 
rest, so in the objective order (as Plato shows in the 
<i>Parmenides</i><sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> by a more cogent process of direct argument) the 
Idea is identical with another thing (<b>tauton</b>) and at the same 
time is different from other things (<b>thateron</b>). In this way, we 
have <i>unity in plurality</i> and <i>plurality in unity</i>. A 
Scholastic would say that the fundamental unity of the subject is not 
incompatible with the formal multiplicity of its qualities, and while 
this is not precisely  
 <!--
PLATO'S THEORY OF IDEAS 103 
 --><A NAME="p103"></a>
 what Plato meant, it is certainly a better illustration of Plato's 
meaning than is the Neo-Platonic interpretation, according to which by 
Ideas Plato meant numbers. It is, however, very likely that Plato did 
not clearly understand how unity and multiplicity could belong to the 
Idea.<p>

Just as Plato attacked the Eleatic doctrine of the oneness of Being so 
did he<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> attack the Eleatic doctrine of immobility. <i>The Idea is 
active</i>, for, if it were inert, it would be capable neither of being 
known by us nor of constituting reality; and to cause things to be 
known and to constitute their reality are, so to speak, the two 
functions of the Idea. Not only is the Idea described as active,<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> but 
even as the only true cause. In a remarkable passage,<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> Socrates is 
represented as saying that he was dissatisfied with the speculations of 
the Physicists, that he was disappointed in his hope that Anaxagoras 
would explain the origin of things, and that he finally discovered that 
Ideas are the only adequate causes of phenomena. Aristotle, therefore, 
is right in saying<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> that he knew of no efficient causes in the 
doctrine of Plato except Ideas, and thus we are forced to accept 
without attempting to explain the Platonic doctrine that Ideas, without 
being caused, are causes; that although they are not subject to 
Becoming, they are the power by whose agency all phenomena become. 
Still, in justice to Plato, it should be remembered that while he 
maintains the dynamic function of the Ideas, holding them to be living 
powers, he is primarily concerned with their static, or plastic, 
function, inasmuch as they are the forms, or types, of existing things.<p>

3. <i>The world of Ideas</i>. Plato hardly ever speaks of the Idea, but 
always of Ideas in the plural, for there is a world of Ideas. Indeed, 
we may say that for Plato there are three worlds: world of concrete 
phenomena, the world of our concepts, and the world of Ideas 
(<b>kosmos</b>, or <b>topos no&ecirc;tos</b>). The relation 
 <!--
104 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p104"></a>
 between the first and third of these worlds will be discussed later 
under the head of Physics. The relation between the world of concepts 
and the world of Ideas lies in the fact that the former is the faint 
reflection of the latter. This is how Plato would describe it; in 
modern terminology we should say the world of Ideas is the logical and 
ontological <i>prius</i> of the world of concepts. But, however we view 
the relation between the two worlds, it cannot be denied that there is 
at least a <i>parallelism</i> between them. To every concept 
corresponds an Idea, and to the laws of thought which rule the world of 
concepts correspond the laws of Being which rule the world of Ideas.<p>

In the first place, just as our concepts are many, the Ideas are many. 
Everything has its Idea, -- what is small and worthless as well as 
what is great and perfect. Products of art as well as objects of 
nature; substances, qualities, relations, mathematical figures, and 
grammatical forms, -- all these have their Ideas.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> That alone has no 
Idea which is mere Becoming. The number of Ideas, then, is indefinite.<p>

In the second place, our concepts possess a logical unity, and so in 
all the multiplicity of Ideas there is <i>a unity which may be called 
organic</i>. The Ideas form a series descending in well-ordered 
division and subdivision from the highest genera to the individual, and 
it is the task of science to represent this series, -- to descend in 
thought from the one to the multiple. Plato himself<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> attempted to 
perform this task, naming, as the most universal Ideas, <i>Being and
 not-Being, like and unlike, unity and number, the straight and the 
crooked</i>, -- an attempt which suggests on the one hand the ten 
opposites of the Pythagoreans and on the other hand the ten 
Aristotelian categories. The classification is of course incomplete.<p>

Of greater importance than this incomplete enumeration of the highest 
kinds of Ideas is Plato's doctrine of the supremacy of the <i>Idea of 
good</i>. As in the material universe the sun is the 
 <!--
PLATO'S THEORY OF IDEAS 105 
 --><A NAME="p105"></a>
 source of light and life, illumining the earth and filling every part 
of it with life-producing warmth, so in the supersensible world of 
Ideas the Idea of good is the light and life of all the other Ideas 
causing them both to be and to be known.<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> But what does Plato mean by 
this Idea of good? Is it merely the absolute good, acting as final 
cause, the goal of human activity, the ultimate end of all things? If 
this were Plato's meaning, the good might be defined as a final cause; 
it could not be defined as efficient cause, and it certainly is so 
described.<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup> Moreover, in the <i>Philebus</i><sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> the good is 
identified with divine reason. The only rational interpretation, 
therefore, of Plato's doctrine of the good is that by the Idea of good 
Plato meant God Himself. It is true that for us who are accustomed to 
represent the Deity as a person, it is not easy to realize how Plato 
could hypostatize a universal concept and call it God, or how he could 
conceive the source of life and energy to be intelligent, and yet 
describe it in terms inconsistent with self-consciousness.  The correct 
explanation seems to be that the relation between personality and 
intelligence did not suggest itself to Plato. (Not only he, but the 
ancient philosophers in general, lacked a definite notion of what 
personality is. Plato, it must be understood, did not deny the 
personality of God. Indeed, he often speaks of God as a person. He was 
simply unconscious of the problem which suggests itself so naturally 
to us, How to reconcile the notion of personality with the Idea of good 
which he identified with God?<p>

From the consideration of the Idea of good we are led to the next 
division of Plato's philosophy, namely, physics; it was because of his 
goodness that God created phenomena. We pass therefore, as it were, 
through the Idea of good, from the world of Ideas to the world of 
phenomena.<p>

<b>Physics</b>. Under this head are included all the manifestations of 
the Idea in the world of phenomena. Now the world 
 <!--
106 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p106"></a>
 of phenomena is the world of sense-presentation, the region of change 
and multiplicity and imperfection and, therefore, of partial not-Being. 
It presents a striking contrast to the world of Ideas, which stands "in 
viewless majesty" above it, and where there is no change, no 
imperfection, no not-Being. Yet these two worlds have something in 
common: there is a <i>contact</i> (<b>koin&ocirc;nia</b>) of the lower 
with the higher, for the phenomenon partakes (<b>metechei</b>) of the 
Idea.<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> Thus the <i>concrete good</i> (good men, good actions) 
partakes of the <i>absolute good</i>: a horse or a fire in the concrete 
world partakes of the horse-in-itself or of the fire-in-itself which 
exists in the world of Ideas. In the <i>Parmenides</i><sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup> the 
participation is explained to be an <i>imitation</i> 
(<b>mim&ecirc;sis</b>), the Ideas being <i>prototypes</i> 
(<b>paradeigmata</b>) of which the phenomena are ectypes, or 
<i>copies</i> (<b>eid&ocirc;la</b>). This participation is, however, so 
imperfect that in beauty and luster and grandeur the world of phenomena 
falls far short of the world of Ideas.<p>

1. Whence, we are forced to ask, comes this imperfection, this partial 
not-Being? For answer, Plato is obliged to assume a principle directly 
antithetical to the Idea. He does not call this principle 
<i>matter</i>, the word <b>hul&ecirc;</b> being first used in this 
sense by Aristotle; and it is a mistake to interpret Plato's thought as 
if by the principle of imperfection he meant a material substratum of 
existence. The phrase by which it is designated varies in the different 
dialogues; it is called, for example, <i>space</i> 
(<b>ch&ocirc;ra</b>), <i>mass</i> (<b>ekmageion</b>), <i>receptacle</i> 
(<b>pandeches</b>), the <i>unlimited</i> (<b>apeiron</b>), and, 
according to some interpreters, it is <i>not-Being</i> (<b>m&ecirc; 
on</b>), and the <i>great and small</i>. It is described in the 
<i>Timeaus</i><sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup> as that in which all things appear, grow up, and decay. 
Consequently, it is a negative principle of limitation, more akin to 
space than to matter, and Aristotle is right in contrasting<sup><small><a name="n35"><a href="#n_35">{35}</a></a></small></sup> his own 
idea of the limiting principle with that of Plato. The so-called 
Platonic matter is essentially a negation, whereas in
 <!--
PLATO'S PHYSICS 107 
 --><A NAME="p107"></a>
 Aristotle's philosophy negation (<b>steresis</b>) is but a quality of 
matter.<p>

The concept of Platonic matter is not easy to grasp. It is a mere form, 
yet it is not a form of the mind in any Kantian sense. It is a form 
objectively existing, and yet it is not a reality. Plato himself 
recognized the difficulty which the concept of the principle of 
limitation involved. In the <i>Timaeus</i><sup><small><a name="n36"><a href="#n_36">{36}</a></a></small></sup> he tells us that it is 
known by a kind of <i>spurious reason</i> (<b>logism&ocirc; 
noth&ocirc;</b>) and is hardly a <i>matter of belief</i>. The 
confession does not surprise us, for in this attempt to designate a 
limiting principle lies the fatal flaw of the whole Platonic theory. To 
derive the limited from the unlimited, the partial not-Being from 
Being, is a task which neither Plato nor Spinoza could fulfill 
consistently with his first assumptions. Aristotle detected this 
weakness in the idealistic monism of Plato, as well as in the 
materialistic monism of the early Physicists, and it was in order to 
supply the defects of both that he introduced the dualistic concept of 
a world which is the outcome of the potential and the actual.<p>

Plato, therefore, failed to account satisfactorily for the derivation 
of the sensuous from the supersensuous world. He had recourse, as 
Aristotle remarks,<sup><small><a name="n37"><a href="#n_37">{37}</a></a></small></sup> to such widely different expressions as 
<i>participation, community</i> (<b>koin&ocirc;nia</b>), 
<i>imitation</i> ; but he must have been aware that by these phrases 
he evaded rather than solved the real problem. One point, however, is 
beyond dispute: Plato assumed that a limiting principle, the source of 
all evil, and imperfection, exists. He assumed it, illogically, in 
defiance of his doctrine that the Idea is the only reality. He is, 
therefore, as one who would be a dualist did his premises allow him to 
depart from the monism which is the starting point of all his 
speculation.<p>

2. In order to explain the world of phenomena, Plato was obliged to 
postulate, besides the Idea and the principle of limitation, the 
existence of a <i>world-soul</i> (<b>Nous</b>), which mediates 
 <!--
108 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p108"></a>
 between the Idea and matter and is the proximate cause of all life and 
order and motion and knowledge in the universe. The universe, he 
taught, is a living animal (<b>z&ocirc;on ennoun</b>), endowed with the 
most perfect and most intelligent of souls, because, as he argues in 
the <i>Timaeus</i>,<sup><small><a name="n38"><a href="#n_38">{38}</a></a></small></sup> if God made the world as perfect as the nature 
of matter (the principle of limitation) would allow, He must have 
endowed it with a soul that is perfect. This soul is a perfect harmony: 
it contains all mathematical proportions. Diffused throughout the 
universe, ceaselessly self-moving according to regular law, it is the 
cause of all change and all Becoming. It is not an Idea, for the Idea 
is uncaused, universal, all-Being, while the world-soul is derived and 
particular and is partly made up of not-Being. Although it is conceived 
by a kind of analogy with the human soul, the question whether it is 
personal or impersonal never suggested itself to Plato.<sup><small><a name="n39"><a href="#n_39">{39}</a></a></small></sup><p>

After the general problem of the derivation of the sensuous from the 
supersensuous world come the particular questions which belong to what 
we call <i>cosmology</i>. Plato himself informs us<sup><small><a name="n40"><a href="#n_40">{40}</a></a></small></sup> that since nature 
is Becoming rather than Being, the study of nature leads not to true 
scientific knowledge (<b>epist&ecirc;me</b>), but to <i>belief</i> only 
(<b>pistis</b>). Cosmology, therefore, and physical science in general 
have a value far inferior to dialectic, which is the science of the 
pure Idea.<p>

3. As to the <i>origin of the universe</i>: The so-called Platonic 
matter is eternal. The universe, however, as it exists had its origin 
in time. This seems to be the natural and obvious sense of Timeus, 28, 
although Xenocrates, an immediate disciple of Plato, was of opinion 
that Plato taught the temporal origin of the world merely for the sake 
of clearness -- to emphasize the fact that it had an origin. Now, 
since matter existed from eternity, the universe was not created. From 
out the chaos which was ruled by necessity (<b>anagke</b>), God, the 
Demiurgos, or Creator, brought order, fashioning the phenomena in 
matter according to 
 <!--
PLATO'S COSMOLOGY 109 
 --><A NAME="p109"></a>
 the eternal prototypes, the Ideas, and making the phenomena -- for He 
was free from jealousy -- as perfect as the imperfection of matter 
would allow. First, He produced the world-soul; then, as the sphere is 
the most perfect figure, He formed for this soul a spherical body 
composed of fire, air, earth, and water -- substances which Empedocles 
had designated as the root principles of the world, and which are now, 
for the first time in the history of philosophy, called 
<i>elements</i>. The question, Why are the elements four in number? 
Plato answers by assigning a teleological as well as a physical 
reason,<sup><small><a name="n41"><a href="#n_41">{41}</a></a></small></sup> thus exhibiting the two influences, Socratic and 
Pythagorean, which more than any other causes contributed to determine 
his physical theories. The four elements differ from one another by the 
possession of definite qualities; all differences of things are 
accounted for by different combinations of the elements themselves --  
bodies are light or heavy according as the element of fire, which is 
light, or the element of earth, which is heavy, prevails.<p>

4. In his explanation of the <i>world-system</i> as it now is, Plato 
shows still more evidently the influence of the Pythagoreans, and 
especially of Philolaus.<sup><small><a name="n42"><a href="#n_42">{42}</a></a></small></sup> Add to this influence the natural tendency 
of Plato's mind towards the idealistic and artistic concept of 
everything, and the doctrine that <i>the heavenly bodies are created 
gods</i> -- the most perfect of God's creatures, from whose fidelity to 
their paths in the firmament man may learn to rule the lawless 
movements of his own soul<sup><small><a name="n43"><a href="#n_43">{43}</a></a></small></sup>  --  will cease to appear out of keeping 
with the seriousness of Plato's attempt to solve the problems of human 
knowledge and human destiny.<p>

5. In Plato's <i>anthropological doctrines</i> the mixture of myth and 
science is more frequent and more misleading than in any other portion 
of his philosophy. As to the <i>origin of the soul</i>, he teaches<sup><small><a name="n44"><a href="#n_44">{44}</a></a></small></sup> 
that when the Creator had formed the universe and the stars He 
commanded the created gods to fashion the human 
 <!--
110 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p110"></a>
 body, while He Himself proceeded to form the human soul (or at least 
the rational part of it), taking for this purpose the same materials 
which He had used to form the world-soul, mixing them in the same cup, 
though the mixture was of inferior purity.<p>

Plato rejects<sup><small><a name="n45"><a href="#n_45">{45}</a></a></small></sup> the doctrine that the soul is a harmony of the body, 
on the ground that the soul has strivings which are contrary to the 
inclinations of sense, and which prove it to be of a nature different 
from that of the body. The soul is expressly defined<sup><small><a name="n46"><a href="#n_46">{46}</a></a></small></sup> as a
 <i>self-moving principle</i>. It is related to the body merely as a 
<i>causa movens</i>. How, then, did it come to be united to the body? 
Plato<sup><small><a name="n47"><a href="#n_47">{47}</a></a></small></sup> answers by the "figure," or allegory, in which is conveyed 
the doctrine of <i>pre&euml;xistence</i>. In the <i>Timaeus</i>, 
however, the mythical form of expression is laid aside, as when, for 
example,<sup><small><a name="n48"><a href="#n_48">{48}</a></a></small></sup> the soul is said to have been united to the body by virtue 
of a cosmic law.<p> 

The doctrine of pre&euml;xistence gave rise to the doctrine of 
<i>recollection</i>, although sometimes, as in the <i>Meno</i>,<sup><small><a name="n49"><a href="#n_49">{49}</a></a></small></sup> the 
previous existence of the soul is proved from the possibility of 
learning. The doctrine of recollection implies that in our 
supercelestial home the soul enjoyed a clear and unclouded vision of 
the Ideas, and that, although it fell from that happy state and was 
steeped in the river of forgetfulness, it still retains an indistinct 
memory of those heavenly intuitions of the truth; so that the sight of 
the phenomena -- mere shadows of the Ideas -- arouses in the soul a 
clearer and fuller recollection of what it contemplated in its previous 
existence. The process of learning consists, therefore, in recalling 
what we have forgotten: <i>to learn is to remember</i>.<p>

If pre&euml;xistence is one pole in the ideal circle of the soul's 
existence, <i>immortality</i> is the other. The sojourn of the soul in 
the world of ever-changing phenomena is but a period of punishment which 
ends with the death of the body. Underlying the mythical language in 
which Plato conveyed his psychological 
 <!--
PLATO'S DOCTRINE OF IMMORTALITY 111  
 --><A NAME="p111"></a>
 doctrines, there is a deep-seated conviction of the reality of the 
future life, a genuine belief in the immortality of the soul. Indeed, 
Plato is the first Greek philosopher to formulate in scientific 
language and to establish with scientific proof an answer to the 
question, Does death end all things? Hitherto, the immortality of the 
soul had been part of the religious systems of Asia and of Greece; now 
it appears for the first time as a scientific thesis, as part of a 
purely rational system of philosophy.<p>

The dialogue which deals expressly with the problem of immortality is 
the <i>Phaedo</i>; there Socrates is represented by the narrator as 
discoursing on the future existence, while the jailer stands at the 
door of the prison with the fatal draught in his hand. The arguments 
which Socrates uses may be summed up as follows:<p>

1. Opposites generate opposites. Out of life comes death: therefore, 
out of death comes life.<sup><small><a name="n50"><a href="#n_50">{50}</a></a></small></sup><p>

2. The soul, being without composition, is akin to the absolutely 
immutable Idea. The body, on the contrary, is, by its composition, akin 
to things which change. When the body is destroyed, the soul, by virtue 
of its affinity to the indestructible, is enabled to resist all decay 
and destruction.<sup><small><a name="n51"><a href="#n_51">{51}</a></a></small></sup><p>

3. If the soul existed before the body, it is natural to expect that it 
will exist after the body. That it existed before the body is proved by 
the doctrine of recollection.<sup><small><a name="n52"><a href="#n_52">{52}</a></a></small></sup><p>

4. Besides these arguments, the following proof is used by Plato.<sup><small><a name="n53"><a href="#n_53">{53}</a></a></small></sup> 
The dissolution of anything is accomplished by the evil which is 
opposed to it. Now, moral evil is the only evil which is opposed to the 
nature of the soul; if, then, sin does not destroy the soul, -- as 
it certainly does not, -- the reason must be that the soul is 
indestructible.<p>

Underlying all the foregoing arguments is the one pivotal thought of 
Plato's psychology, that <i>life necessarily belongs to the  
 <!--
112 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p112"></a>
 Idea of the soul</i>. This thought is brought out in the last of the 
Socratic arguments.<p>

5. An Idea cannot pass into its opposite, -- a Scholastic would say 
essences are immutable. An Idea, therefore, which has a definite 
concept attached to it excludes the opposite of that concept. Now, life 
belongs to the Idea of the soul. Consequently, the soul excludes death, 
which is the opposite of life. A dead soul is a contradiction in 
terms.<sup><small><a name="n54"><a href="#n_54">{54}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The same <i>ontological argument</i> occurs in <i>Phaedrus</i>, 245, 
and it is evidently the chief argument on which Plato bases his 
conviction that the soul is immortal. Yet in the <i>Phaedo</i>, after 
each of Socrates' listeners has signified his acceptance of the proof, 
Socrates is made to agree with Simmias that there is no longer room for 
any uncertainty <i>except that which arises from the greatness of the 
subject and the feebleness of the human mind</i>.<sup><small><a name="n55"><a href="#n_55">{55}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Closely allied with the doctrine of immortality is the doctrine of 
<i>transmigration of souls</i> and of <i>future retribution</i>. Plato 
recognized that immortality involves the idea of future retribution of 
some sort, just as the necessity of a future retribution involves 
immortality. He did not determine scientifically the precise nature of 
retribution in the next life. He was content with adopting the 
transmigration myths which he derived from the mysteries. Yet, for 
Plato, these myths contained a germ of truth, although the most that 
can be safely said is that he seriously maintained the doctrine of 
transmigration in a generic sense: the details so carefully set forth 
in the <i>Timaeus</i> and in the <i>Phaedo</i> are not to be taken as 
part of Plato's scientific thought.<p>

When we speak of immortality we must not imagine that Plato held every 
part of the soul to be immortal. He enumerates three <i>parts of the 
soul</i>,  -- the <i>rational</i> (<b>logos</b>), the <i>irascible</i> 
(<b>thumos</b>), and the <i>appetitive</i> (<b>epithumia</b>) parts. 
These are not faculties or powers of one substance, but parts 
(<b>mer&ecirc;</b>) the distinction 
 <!--
PLATO'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 113 
 --><A NAME="p113"></a>
 of which is proved by the fact that appetite strives against reason, 
and anger against reason and appetite.<sup><small><a name="n56"><a href="#n_56">{56}</a></a></small></sup> Reason resides in the head; 
the irascible soul, the seat of courage, is in the heart; and appetite, 
the seat of desire, is in the abdomen.<sup><small><a name="n57"><a href="#n_57">{57}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Of these three, the rational part alone is immortal. It alone is 
produced by God. By maintaining that the soul has parts Plato weakens 
his doctrine of immortality and exposes it to many objections.<p>

Plato in his <i>theory of knowledge</i> bases his distinction of kinds 
of knowledge on the distinction of objects. Objects of knowledge<sup><small><a name="n58"><a href="#n_58">{58}</a></a></small></sup> are 
divided as follows:<p>

<ul>
<li>Supersensible objects (<b>No&ecirc;ton genos</b>)
<ul>
<li> Ideas (<b>Ideai</b>)
<li> Mathematical entities (<b>Math&ecirc;matika</b>)
</ul>
<li>Sensible objects (<b>Horaton genos</b>)
<ul> 
<li> Real bodies (<b>S&ocirc;mata</b>)
<li> Semblances of bodies (<b>Eikones</b>)
</ul>
</ul><p>

To this corresponds the division of knowledge:<p>

<ul>
<li>Supersensible knowledge (<b>No&ecirc;sis</b>)
<ul>
<li> Intellect (<b>Nous</b>)
<li> Reason (<b>Dianoia</b>)
</ul>
<li>Opinion: sense-knowledge (<b>Doxa</b>)
<ul>
<li> Sense-perception (<b>Pistis</b>)
<li> Imagination (<b>Eikasia</b>)
</ul>
</ul><p>

Knowledge begins with sense-perception. The senses, however, cannot 
attain a knowledge of truth. They contemplate the imperfect copies of 
the Ideas; as long as we look upon the objects of sense we are merely 
gazing at the shadows of things which, according to the celebrated 
Allegory of the Cave,<sup><small><a name="n59"><a href="#n_59">{59}</a></a></small></sup> are moving where we cannot see them, namely, 
in the world of Ideas from which the soul has fallen. (Yet though the 
senseperceived world cannot lead us to a knowledge of Ideas, it can
 <!--
114 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p114"></a>
 and does remind us of the Ideas which we saw in a previous existence. 
It is by the doctrine of recollection, therefore, that Plato bridges 
over the chasm between sense-knowledge and a knowledge of reality. 
Phenomena are not the causes, but merely the occasions of our 
intellectual knowledge; for in knowledge, as in existence, the 
universal, according to Plato, is the <i>prius</i> of the individual.<p>

The doctrine of the <i>freedom of the will</i> assumes a novel phase in 
the philosophy of Plato. Plato unequivocally asserts that the will is 
free.<sup><small><a name="n60"><a href="#n_60">{60}</a></a></small></sup> Not only is freedom of choice a quality of adult human 
activity, but it is free choice also that decides our parentage, 
hereditary tendencies, physical constitution, and early education, for 
all these are the result of actions freely performed during the 
previous existence of the soul. Notwithstanding this doctrine of 
freedom, Plato<sup><small><a name="n61"><a href="#n_61">{61}</a></a></small></sup> holds the Socratic principle that no one is 
voluntarily bad.<p>

Plato's <i>physiological doctrines</i> are of interest as serving to 
show the futility of attempting to explain the complicated phenomena of 
life with such inadequate experimental data as he had at his command. 
He was forced by his philosophical principles to neglect observation 
and to underestimate sense-knowledge. Aristotle, who attached greater 
value to empirical knowledge, was far more successful in his 
investigation of natural phenomena.<p>

<b>Ethics</b>. Under this head are included Plato's ethical and 
political doctrines. If Plato's physics was styled the study of the 
Idea in the world of phenomena, this portion of his philosophy may be 
called the study of the Idea in human action and human society. Ethics, 
however, is vastly more important than physics in the Platonic system 
of thought; for physics is treated as if it were scarcely more than a 
science of the apparent, while such is the importance attached to 
ethics that Plato's philosophy as a whole has been described as 
primarily ethical. 
 <!--
PLATO'S ETHICS 115  
 --><A NAME="p115"></a>
 And the description is true to a certain extent. All Platonic, as well 
as Socratic, speculation starts with an inquiry about the good and the 
beautiful, and proceeds, in the case of Plato, through the doctrine of 
concepts to the theory of Ideas. Nevertheless, while Socratic influence 
is more apparent in Plato's ethics than in any other portion of his 
philosophy, it is true that the system of ethics in its completed form 
is part of the Platonic structure, and is conditioned by the 
metaphysics, anthropology, and physics of Plato, as well as by the 
Socratic inquiries concerning virtue.<p>

1. <i>The highest good</i>, subjectively considered, is happiness<sup><small><a name="n62"><a href="#n_62">{62}</a></a></small></sup>; 
objectively, it is the Idea of good, which, as has been seen, is 
identified with God.<sup><small><a name="n63"><a href="#n_63">{63}</a></a></small></sup> Consequently, the aim of man's actions should 
be to free himself from the bonds of the flesh, from the trammels of 
the body in which the soul is confined, and by means of virtue and 
wisdom to become like to God, even in this life.<sup><small><a name="n64"><a href="#n_64">{64}</a></a></small></sup> Here, however, 
Plato shows a moderation which presents a striking contrast to the 
narrow-mindedness and intolerance of the Cynics as well as to the 
sensualism of the Hedonists; for though virtue and wisdom are the chief 
constituents of happiness, there is place also for right opinion, art, 
and for such pleasures as are genuine and free from passion.<sup><small><a name="n65"><a href="#n_65">{65}</a></a></small></sup><p>

2. <i>Virtue</i> differs from the other constituents of happiness in 
this, that it alone is essential. It is defined<sup><small><a name="n66"><a href="#n_66">{66}</a></a></small></sup> as the order, 
harmony, and health of the soul, while vice is the contrary condition. 
Socrates had identified all virtue with wisdom; Plato merely assigns to 
wisdom the highest place among virtues, reducing all virtues to four 
supreme kinds, -- <i>wisdom, fortitude, temperance</i>, and 
<i>justice</i>.<sup><small><a name="n67"><a href="#n_67">{67}</a></a></small></sup> He differs also from Socrates in his attempt to 
reduce the idea of virtue to its practical applications. Socrates, as 
has been pointed out, based all practical virtue on  
 <!--
116 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p116"></a>
 expediency; Plato, on the contrary, abandoned the utilitarian view, 
and by attaching to virtue an independent value inculcated greater 
purity of intention.<p>

3. It is in the <i>State</i> that we find the most important 
applications of Plato's doctrine of virtue. Man should aim at being 
virtuous, and could, even in his savage condition, attain virtue. 
Without education, however, virtue would be a matter of mere chance, 
and without the State education would be impossible. While, therefore, 
the State is not the aim and end of human action, it is the 
indispensable condition of knowledge and Virtue.<sup><small><a name="n68"><a href="#n_68">{68}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Accordingly, <i>the State should have for its object virtue</i>, or, as 
we should say, the establishment and maintenance of morality. Now, the 
only power that can remove from virtue what is contingent and casual 
and can place morality on a firm foundation is philosophy. 
Consequently, in the Platonic State, philosophy is the dominant power, 
and Plato teaches expressly that "unless philosophers become rulers or 
rulers become true and thorough students of philosophy, there will be 
no end to the troubles of states and of humanity."<sup><small><a name="n69"><a href="#n_69">{69}</a></a></small></sup> The ideal State 
is <i>modeled on the individual soul</i>, for the State is the larger 
man. Now, in the soul there are three parts; in the State, therefore, 
there are three orders, -- <i>rulers, warriors</i>, and 
<i>producers</i>.<sup><small><a name="n70"><a href="#n_70">{70}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In the details of his scheme for the government of the ideal State, 
Plato is led by his aristocratic tendencies to advocate a system of 
<i>state absolutism</i>. He abolishes private interests and private 
possessions. He sacrifices the individual and the family to the 
community. He subordinates marriage and education to the interests of 
the State. He acknowledges, however, that his schemes are difficult of 
realization, and it is for this reason that in the <i>Laws</i> he 
sketches the scheme which, though inferior to the scheme outlined in 
<i>The Republic</i>, is nearer to the level of what the average State 
can attain. 
 <!--
PLATO'S RELIGIOUS DOCTRINES 117
 --><A NAME="p117"></a><p>

<b>Religion and AEsthetics</b>. This title does not, like physics and 
ethics, designate a portion of Plato's philosophy. It is merely a 
convenient heading under which are grouped the doctrines of Plato 
concerning the existence of God and the nature of the beautiful.<p>

1. <i>Religion</i>. Plato, as we have seen, identifies true religion 
with philosophy. The highest object of philosophical speculation and 
the object of religious worship are one and the same, for philosophy is 
a matter of life and love as well as of theoetical thought. Atheism, 
therefore, is as irrational as it is impious. The <i>existence of 
God</i> is evident from the order and design which Plato recognizes 
as existing not only in animal organisms but also in the larger world 
of astronomy, in the cosmos whose soul is so much superior to the souls 
of animals and of men.<sup><small><a name="n71"><a href="#n_71">{71}</a></a></small></sup> Besides this teleological argument Plato makes 
use of the argument from efficient cause.<sup><small><a name="n72"><a href="#n_72">{72}</a></a></small></sup> He combats the principles of 
the early Physicists, according to whom all things, including reason 
itself, came originally from matter. This he considers to be an 
inversion of the true sequence; for reason precedes matter and is the 
cause of all material motion and of all the processes of matter.<p>

The Divinity is the Absolute Good, the Idea of Goodness. Plato extols 
His power, His wisdom, and His all-including knowledge and freely 
criticises the prevailing anthropomorphic notions of God. God is 
supremely perfect: He will never show Himelf to man otherwise than He 
really is; for all lying is alien His nature. He exercises over all 
things a Providence which orders and governs everything for the 
best;<sup><small><a name="n73"><a href="#n_73">{73}</a></a></small></sup> sometimes<sup><small><a name="n74"><a href="#n_74">{74}</a></a></small></sup> Plato speaks of God as a personal Being. Besides 
this sovereign Divinity, Plato admits the existence of <i>subordinate 
created gods</i>.<sup><small><a name="n75"><a href="#n_75">{75}</a></a></small></sup> It is they who mediate between God and matter, and 
fashion the body of man as well as the irrational parts of his 
 <!--
118 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p118"></a>
 soul. Chief among the created gods are the world-soul, the souls of 
the stars, and the demons of ether, air, and water.<p>

With regard to popular mythology, Plato employs the names of the gods; 
he speaks of Zeus, Apollo, and the other divinities. But "the existence 
of these divinities, as held by the Greeks, he never believed, nor does 
he in the least conceal it."<sup><small><a name="n76"><a href="#n_76">{76}</a></a></small></sup><p>

2. <i>AEsthetics</i>. When we consider the importance of art in the 
thought and civilization of Greece, we are surprised at the scant 
attention which aesthetics received from Greek philosophers before 
Plato. And even Plato, though he concerned himself with the analysis of 
the beautiful into its metaphysical constituents, seems to have 
overlooked the necessity of a psychological study of the sentiment of 
the beautiful.<p>

Although the <i>good</i> is the highest of the Ideas, the 
<i>beautiful</i> is of greatest interest in philosophy, because it 
shines more clearly through the veil of phenomena than does any of the 
other Ideas. For the essence of the beautiful is harmony, symmetry, and 
order, -- qualities which strike the mind of the intelligent observer 
of the world of phenomena, even though he fail to penetrate to the 
depths of the phenomenon where the good lies hidden.<p>

By a convenient phrase (<b>kalokagathon</b>) the Greeks identified the 
beautiful with the good. The phrase, however, is capable of two 
interpretations. It was commonly understood to mean that <i>the 
beautiful is good</i>. Plato, following Socrates, interpreted it to 
mean that <i>the good is beautiful</i>. Corporeal beauty, he taught, is 
lowest in the scale of beautiful things; next come fair souls, fair 
sciences, and fair virtues; highest of all is the pure and absolute 
beauty to which none of the grossness of the phenomenon cleaves. Now, 
the good is harmonious and symmetrical Being. The good, therefore, is 
beautiful, and the phenomenon which partakes of the good partakes in 
like manner of the beautiful.<sup><small><a name="n77"><a href="#n_77">{77}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--
PLATO'S THEORY OF ART 119  
 --><A NAME="p119"></a><p>

Art has for its object the realization of the beautiful. All human 
products are imitations; but while, for example, good actions are 
imitations of the Idea of good, and beautiful actions are imitations 
of the Idea of the beautiful, works of art are imitations of phenomena,  
-- imitations of imitations. Consequently, art is not to be compared 
with dialectic, nor with industry, nor with the science of government; 
it is merely a pastime intended to afford pleasure and recreation,  
-- strange doctrine, surely, for one who was himself a poet! Like 
other pastimes, it must be controlled, for art too often flatters the 
vulgar taste of the wicked and the base. Plato, accordingly, taught 
that all artistic productions, the works of sculptors and painters as 
well as those of poets and rhetoricians, should be submitted to 
competent judges, to whom should be delegated the authority of the 
State;<sup><small><a name="n78"><a href="#n_78">{78}</a></a></small></sup> for rhetoric and all the other arts should be placed at the 
service of God, and should be so exercised as to assist the statesman 
in establishing the rule of morality.<sup><small><a name="n79"><a href="#n_79">{79}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. There is scarcely, a portion of Plato's 
philosophy which does not betray the influence of his predecessors. The 
Socratic principle was his starting point. The Pythagorean school 
determined to a large extent his cosmological doctrines as well as his 
speculations about the future life. Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and the 
Earlier Ionians influenced his cosmogenetic theories and his doctrine 
of elements, while Heraclitus, Zeno the Eleatic, and Protagoras the 
Sophist contributed each in his own way to the Platonic theory of 
knowledge. Yet it goes without saying that Plato was no mere compiler. 
He modified even the Socratic teaching before making it part of his 
philosophical system, and whatever he derived from those who went 
before him he molded and wrought so as to fit it for its place in the 
vast philosophical edifice the foundation of which is the <i>theory of 
Ideas</i>. This 
 <!--
120 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p120"></a>
 distinctively Platonic theory is the basis on which rests the whole 
superstructure of physics, dialectic, ethics, theology, and aesthetics. 
It is also the unifying principle in Plato's system of thought. Whether 
the problem he discusses be the immortality of the soul, the nature of 
knowledge, the conditions of the life after death, the mission of the 
State, or the nature of the beautiful, his starting point is always the 
Idea. It is, therefore, no exaggeration to say that with the doctrine 
of Ideas the entire system of Platonic philosophy stands or falls. 
Consequently, our judgment of the value of the contents of Plato's 
philosophy must be postponed until we can enter with Aristotle into a 
critical examination of the value of the theory of Ideas. But whatever 
may be our judgment as to the value of his philosophy, no adverse 
criticism can detract from his preeminent claim to the first place 
among the masters of philosophical style. Even though we refuse to call 
him "profound," we cannot but subscribe to the verdict by which all 
ages have agreed to give to him the titles divine and sublime. 
Subsequent speculation, subsequent discovery, and subsequent increase 
in the facilities for acquiring knowledge have corrected much that 
Plato taught and added much to what he said, and yet not a single 
master has appeared who could dream of rivaling, not to say excelling, 
the literary perfection of his philosophical dialogues. This literary 
perfection goes deeper than words. It includes a peculiar charm of 
manner, by which Plato lifts us from the sordid world of material 
things to a world of exalted types and ennobling ideals. His aim as a 
philosopher is to demonstrate that true knowledge and true reality 
should be sought, not in the things of earth, but in those of that 
other world beyond the heavens, where there is no imperfection, change, 
or decay. It is this charm of manner that Joubert had in mind when he 
wrote: "Plato shows us nothing, but he brings brightness with him; he 
puts light into our eyes, and fills us with a clearness by which all 
objects afterwards become illuminated.

 He teaches us nothing; but he prepares us, fashions us, and makes us 
ready to know all. The habit of reading him augments in us the capacity 
for discerning and entertaining whatever fine truths may afterwards 
present themselves. Like mountain air, it sharpens our organs and gives 
us an appetite for wholesome food."<p>
