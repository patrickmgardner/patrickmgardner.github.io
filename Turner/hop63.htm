<h2 align="center">THIRD PERIOD -- FROM KANT TO OUR OWN TIME</h2><p>

One of the most striking results of the French and German illumination 
was the <i>nationalization of philosophy</i>. During the Middle Ages 
Latin was the language of the scientific world, and even long after 
most of the manners and customs of the Middle Ages had disappeared it 
continued to be the language in which philosophical treatises were 
composed. Contemporaneously with the rise of the deistic controversy in 
England and the spread of the illumination in France and Germany, Latin 
was discarded and philosophy began to speak in the vernacular. The 
result of this change was that philosophy ceased to be cosmopolitan in 
character, and racial and national traits, which had always been 
distinguishable, became more strongly marked. Hence we have, during the 
nineteenth century, <i>German, English, French, Scotch</i>, and 
<i>Italian</i> philosophy, each possessing its distinctly national 
characteristics. It will, therefore, be found more convenient from this 
point onward to follow philosophy in its national development, and to 
treat the history of philosophy according to nations rather than 
according to schools and systems.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup>

GERMAN PHILOSOPHY</h3><p>

Although the greater part of Kant's life lies within the eighteenth 
century, his philosophy belongs to the nineteenth. It is from the 
fundamental principles of his system of thought that the great 
speculative and practical tendencies of this third period spring. With 
Kant, therefore, begins the last period in the history of modern 
philosophy.<p>

KANT<p>

<b>Life</b>. Immanuel Kant was born at K&ouml;nigsberg in the year 
1724. His parents were, according to family tradition, of Scotch 
descent. At the age of sixteen he entered the University of 
K&ouml;nigsberg, and there, for six years studied Wolff's philosophy 
and Newton's physics, having for teacher Martin Knutzen. On leaving the 
university he spent nine years as tutor in several distinguished 
families. He returned to K&ouml;nigsberg in 1755 to qualify himself for 
the position of licensed but unsalaried teacher (<i>Privatdocent</i>) 
at the university, a career in which he lingered for fifteen years. His 
first book, which was published in 1747, under the title <i>Gedanken 
von der wahren Sch&auml;tzung der lebendigen Kr&auml;fte</i>, "Thoughts 
on the True Estimation of Living Forces," was followed by several 
others which treated of physical and metaphysical problems. Meantime he 
continued to lecture on Wolffian philosophy, employing the text-books 
then commonly in use, although it is evident from his written works and 
from the programme of his lectures that he had at this time begun to 
criticise both Wolff and Newton. The first outline of a definite 
independent system appears in the dissertation <i>De Mundi Sensibilis 
atque Intelligibilis Formis et Principiis</i>, which was published in 
1770. In the same year Kant was appointed to the chair of philosophy at 
K&ouml;nigsberg, which he held until 1797. His epoch-making work, the 
<i>Kritik der reinen Vernunft</i>, appeared in 1781. This was followed 
by the <i>Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten</i> (1785), the 
<i>Kritik der praktischen Vernunft</i> (1788), the <i>Kritik der 
Urtheilskraft</i> (1790), and the <i>Religion innerhalb der Grenzen der 
blossen Vernunft</i> (1794). The last of these works provoked the 
hostility of the orthodox, and was the occasion of a reprimand from the 
government of East Prussia. 
 <!--
KANT'S DEFINITION OF PHILOSOPY 529 
 --><A NAME="p529"></a><p>

Kant spent the greater part of his life as professor at 
K&ouml;nigsberg. He never traveled, and had no appreciation of art; he 
was, however, thoroughly in sympathy with Nature in all her moods, 
professing unbounded admiration for "the starry sky above him and the 
moral law within him." He died in 1804.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The three <i>Critiques</i> -- the <i>Critique of Pure 
Reason</i> (the argument of which is presented in shorter and more 
readable form in the <i>Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysic</i>), the 
<i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>, and the <i>Critique of the Faculty 
of Judgment</i> -- form a trilogy of Kantian literature. Kant's 
complete works were published at various times, the best editions being 
Hartenstein's second edition, in eight volumes (Leipzig, 1867-1869), 
and Rosenkranz and Schubert's edition, in twelve volumes (Leipzig,
 1838-1842). A new edition is being published by the Berlin Academy of 
Sciences. The <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> was translated into 
English by Meiklejohn (London, 1854) and by Max M&uuml;ller (London, 
1881); the <i>Prolegomena</i>, by Mahaffy and Bernard (London, 1889); 
the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>, by Abbott (London, 1889); and 
the <i>Critique of Judgment</i>, by Bernard (London, 1892). To the list 
of secondary sources<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> must be added M. Ruyssen's <i>Kant</i> 
(<i>Grands Philosophes</i> series, Paris, 1900) and Paulsen's 
<i>Kant</i> (trans. by Creighton and Lefevre, New York, 1902). 
Wallace's <i>Kant</i> (<i>Blackwood's Philosophical Classics</i>, 
Edinburgh and Philadelphia, 1892) and E. Caird's <i>Critical Philosophy 
of Kant</i> (London, 1889) are the best English presentations of Kant's 
system.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>General Standpoint and Aim</b>. In the introduction to the 
<i>Prolegomena</i>, Kant informs us of the origin and aim of his 
philosophical investigations. "It was," he observes, "the suggestion of 
David Hume which first interrupted my dogmatic slumber and gave my 
investigations in the field of speculative philosophy quite a new 
direction. I first tried whether Hume's objection could not be put into 
a general form, and soon found that the  
 <!--
530 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p530"></a>
 concept of the connexion of cause and effect was by no means the only 
one by which the understanding thinks the connexion of things <i>a 
priori</i>. I sought to make certain of the number of such connexions, 
and when I had succeeded in this, by starting from a single principle, 
I proceeded to the deduction of these concepts which I was now certain 
were not deduced from experience, as Hume had apprehended, but sprang 
from the pure understanding."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> If, therefore, we divide systems of 
philosophy into <i>rational</i> and <i>empirical</i>, according as they 
lay stress on the <i>a priori</i> concepts and principles of the pure 
understanding, or on the <i>a posteriori</i> impressions and 
associations of the empirical faculties, we may describe Kant as 
dissatisfied with the rational philosophy because it exaggerated the 
<i>a priori</i>, and with the empirical philosophy because it 
exaggerated the <i>a posteriori</i> elements of knowledge. Consequently 
he sets himself the task of examining or criticising all knowledge for 
the purpose of determining or, as he says, "deducing," the <i>a 
priori</i> concepts or forms of thought. And if it is the task of 
philosophy to answer the questions, What can I know? What ought I to 
do? What may I hope for? Kant considers that the answers to the second 
and third questions depend on the answer given to the first. His 
philosophy is, therefore, a <i>transcendental criticism</i>,<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> that 
is, an examination of knowledge for the purpose of determining the <i>a 
priori</i> elements, which are the conditions of knowledge, and which 
we cannot know by mere experience.<p>

<b>Division of Philosophy</b>. Kant, as is well known, first devoted 
his attention to the transcendental criticism of <i>pure reason</i>, 
and afterwards took up the transcendental criticism of <i>practical 
reason</i>. In the first part of the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> he 
distinguishes the <i>transcendental aesthetic</i> and the 
<i>transcendental 
 <!--
KANT'S TRANSCENDENTAL LOGIC 531
 --><A NAME="p531"></a>
 logic</i>, and subdivides the latter into <i>transcendental 
analytic</i> and <i>transcendental dialectic</i>.<p>

<b>Transcendental AEsthetic</b> is defined as the "science of all the 
principles of sensibility <i>a priori</i>,"<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> or <i>the inquiry into 
the</i> a priori <i>conditions of sensation</i>. Now, our external 
senses represent their objects as extended in <i>space</i>, and our 
internal senses represent our conscious states as succeeding each other 
in <i>time</i>. Space and time are the <i>a priori</i> conditions of 
external and internal sensation, -- conditions or forms which make 
sensation possible. They are, therefore, anterior to all experience. 
Space and time are not, as is commonly supposed, empirical concepts 
derived from experience; their <i>a priori</i> character appears from 
the very fact that knowledge based on the nature of space and time 
(mathematical knowledge) is necessary and universal; for it is a 
primary postulate of all Kant's transcendental inquiry that <i>nothing 
which is necessary and universal</i> can come from experience. Space 
and time are not properties of things; they belong to the subject, 
inhere in the subject, and are, so to speak, part of the subjective 
world. Their r&ocirc;le is to reduce the multiplicity of the object to 
that unity which is an essential condition of being perceived by the 
subject, which is <i>one</i>. They are the conditions of sensitive 
intuition, and have no objective reality, except in so far as they are 
applied to real things in the act of perception. "Space and time are 
the pure forms of our intuition, while sensation forms its matter."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Transcendental Logic</b>. General logic treats either of the pure 
forms of thought, or of these forms in their relation to concrete 
experience (applied logic). Transcendental logic treats of the origin, 
extent, and validity of concepts, which are neither of empirical nor of 
aesthetic origin, but are <i>a priori</i>. It is divided into 
<i>transcendental analytic</i> and <i>transcendental dialectic</i>: the 
first treats of the forms of the pure understanding (judgment), 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="_"></a>
 while the second treats of the elements of that knowledge which is 
pure understanding applied to objects given in intuition; and as this 
application is made by the reason, we may describe transcendental 
dialectic as the criticism of reason in the stricter sense of the 
word.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

A. <i>Transcendental Analytic</i>. The <i>a priori</i> forms of the 
pure understanding are the categories, which stand to intellectual 
knowledge in the relation in which space and time stand to
 sense-knowledge. It will be well to consider: (a) the existence of the 
categories; (b) the construction of the table of categories; (c) the 
nature of the categories; and (d) the objective value of the 
categories.<p>

a. <i>The existence of the categories</i>. All intuitions being 
sensuous, and the understanding being a supersensible faculty, it is 
evident that the concepts which belong to the understanding are not 
immediately referred to an object, but to some other representation, 
that is, to an intuition or to another concept. All the acts of the 
understanding may therefore be reduced to judgments.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> Now there are 
judgments which are merely contingent and particular, as, "This table 
is square"; and there are judgments which are necessary and universal, 
as, "The sides of a square are equal to one another." But (and this is 
the fundamental assumption in Kant's <i>Critique</i>) wkat is necessary 
and universal in our knowledge is <i>a priori</i>. "Therefore, there is 
in our knowledge of necessary and universal propositions an <i>a 
priori</i> element, and this is the <i>form</i>, or <i>category</i>.<p>

b. <i>Construction of the table of categories</i>. Kant considers that 
Aristotle failed to draw up a complete and scientific table of the 
highest genera because that "acute thinker" did not realize that the 
right method to be pursued is not the analysis of being, but the analysis 
of thought. Now, according to Kant, to think is to judge, and to judge 
is to synthesize, or unite, two representations, namely subject and 
predicate. But since we 
 <!--
KANT'S TABLE OF CATEGORIES 533
 --><A NAME="p533"></a>
 are inquiring into the <i>a priori</i> elements of thought we must 
empty the subject and predicate of all their empirical and intuitional 
content, and consider merely their relations to each other. On the 
different kinds of relation which exist between subject and predicate 
we shall base our construction of the table of categories. These 
relations Kant reduces to twelve, to which, therefore, correspond the 
twelve categories:<p>

<center><table cellpadding="8">

<tr><td>&nbsp; &nbsp; Singular</td><td>Totality </td></tr>

</table></center><p>

It may be observed, in <i>criticism of this system of categories</i>, 
that an analysis of judgment is not a complete analysis of thought; for 
the ideas of which the judgment is composed are themselves capable of 
analysis. Indeed, while the analysis of judgment may be made the basis 
of a system of predicables, it is on an analysis of ideas that a system 
of categories must be based. Moreover, it is evident that in the 
Kantian table of categories, correctness of analysis is sacrificed. to 
symmetry of arrangement. 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 534 
 --><A NAME="p534"></a><p>

c. <i>The nature of the categories</i>. Kant's <i>a priori</i> forms, 
or categories, are not mere subjective dispositions, mere tendencies 
such as Leibniz attributed to the psychic monad, -- capabilities to 
be evolved into actuality in the process of ideation. Nor are they 
full-fledged ideas such as Plato attributed to the soul in its prenatal 
existence. they are the empty forms of intellectual knowledge, all the 
contents of intellectual knowledge being derived from experience.<p>

The nature of the categories is best understood by a study of their 
<i>function</i>. All knowledge, whether sensuous or intellectual, is 
conditioned by unity, and is effected by a synthesis of the manifold of 
representations (sense impressions, etc.). Now, "How," Kant asks, 
"should we, <i>a priori</i>, have arrived at such a synthetical unity 
if the subjective grounds of such unity were not contained <i>a 
priori</i> in the original sources of all our knowledge ? "<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> We have 
seen that the <i>a priori</i> forms which effect the requisite unity in 
the case of sense-knowledge are space and time. The function of the 
categories is entirely similar: to effect the requisite unity in the 
case of intellectual knowledge, -- to synthesize the manifold of 
experience. But how is the application of the form to the contents 
brought about? The <i>a priori</i> forms must be brought down to the 
empirical contents <i>anteriorly to experience</i>; for they render 
empirical knowledge possible. Kant is therefore obliged to have 
recourse to the doctrine of <i>schematism</i>. The <i>schemata</i> are 
the work of the synthetic imagination, and mediate between the <i>a 
priori</i> form and the manifold of experience. Thus "the 
transcendental determination of time (which is the principal 
<i>schema</i>) is so far homogeneous with the category that it is 
general and founded on a rule <i>a priori</i>; and it is, on the other 
hand, so far homogeneous with the phenomenon that time must be 
contained in every empirical representation of the manifold."<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> From 
the fundamental schema, which is time, are derived as many schemata as 
there are categories. 
 <!--
KANT'S DOCTRINE OF CATEGORIES 535 
 --><A NAME="p535"></a><p>

The mental field thickens with the multitude of media through which and 
by means of which the process of intellectual knowledge takes place. We 
have, first, the manifold representations of sense-impression; then the 
application of the forms of space and time resulting in
 sense-intuition; next, we have the schema, and last of all the <i>a 
priori</i> form. And yet all this multiplicity is introduced in order 
to effect the synthetic unity without which knowledge is impossible. 
The representations are unified by the application of the <i>a 
priori</i> forms of space and time; the intuitions resulting from this 
application are in turn unified by the determining schema, which gives 
reality to the highest unifying form, namely the category. Finally, 
above all these is the unity of consciousness.<p>

The doctrine of the function of the categories is well summed up in the 
formula, <i>representations without the categories are blind, the 
categories without representative or other empirical content are 
empty</i>. With regard to the schematism of our understanding applied 
to phenomena and their mere form, it were well, perhaps, to content 
ourselves with Kant's saying that such schematism is "an art hidden in 
the depth of the human soul, the true sense of which we shall hardly 
ever be able to understand."<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup><p>

d. <i>The objective value of the categories</i>. The value of the 
categories lies in this, that they render synthetic <i>a priori</i> 
judgments possible and thus make intellectual knowledge possible. In 
judgments which are merely analytical we remain within the given 
concept, while predicating something of it; but in judgments which are 
synthetic we go beyond the concept, in order to bring something 
together with it which is wholly different from what is contained in 
it.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> It is therefore by means of synthetic <i>a priori</i> judgments 
that we make progress in our intellectual knowledge of reality, and 
since the categories are the <i>a priori</i> elements of such 
judgments, -- the elements which confer
 <!--
536 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p536"></a>
 necessity and universality on them, thereby making them to be 
scientific, -- it is evident that it is the categories that render 
intellectual knowledge possible. Without the categories the objects of 
intellectual knowledge would be <i>given</i> in experience, but not 
<i>known</i>.<p>

Although the categories are <i>a priori</i>, that is, independent of 
sensation, they <i>do not extend our knowledge beyond phenomena</i>; 
they do not lead us to a noumenal knowledge of that which is 
<i>given</i> in sensation. Of themselves they are empty; in order to be 
valid they must be filled by experience, and all the content which 
experience can put into them is phenomenal. "The understanding <i>a 
priori</i> can never do more than anticipate the form of a possible 
experience; and, as nothing can be an object of experience except the 
phenomenon, it follows that the understanding can never go beyond the 
limits of sensibility. As phenomena are nothing but representations, 
the understanding refers them to a something as the object of our 
sensuous intuition. This means a something equal to x, of which we do 
not, nay, with the present constitution of our understanding can not, 
know anything."<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> This something is the <i>noumenon, the 
transcendental object, the thing-in-itself (Ding an sich)</i>.<p>

B. <i>Transcendental Dialectic</i>, which is the third portion of the 
<i>Critique of Pure Reason</i>, has for its object the examination or 
criticism of the ideas. These are forms less general than the 
categories, elements of reasoning rather than of judgment, serving to 
unify the manifold of intellectual experience, just as the categories 
and space and time serve to unify the manifold of sense-representation 
and impression. Consequently they do not refer immediately to the 
objects of intuition, but only to the understanding and its judgments. 
Now, just as the forms of judgment furnished us with a basis for the 
system of categories, so the forms of inference serve as a basis for 
the enumeration of ideas. To the three forms of syllogistic reasoning, 
namely 
 <!--
KANT'S TRANSCENDENTAL DIALECTIC 537 
 --><A NAME="p537"></a>
 categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive, correspond the three ideas 
of the reasoning faculty, namely the <i>idea of the soul</i>, or 
thinking subject, the <i>idea of matter</i>, or the totality of 
phenomena, and the <i>idea of God</i>, the supreme condition of all 
possibility.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> Reason being immanent, that is, having no direct relation 
to objects, these three ideas, the psychological, the cosmological, and 
the theological, should remain immanent. The attempt to establish them 
as existing outside the mind must necessarily lead to an entanglement 
of contradictions, and it is the aim of the transcendental dialectic to 
expose these contradictions and so dispel the transcendental illusion, 
which has vitiated every system of psychology, cosmology, and theology.<p>

a. <i>Psychological idea</i>. Kant rejects the rational psychology 
which attributes to the soul identity, substantiality, immateriality, 
and immortality. The whole Wolffian and Cartesian system of psychology 
he considers to be false in its starting point, -- the assumption, 
namely, that we have an intuitive knowledge of the understanding. We 
have, he contends, no such intuition. Thought is a succession of 
unifications, or syntheses: at the apex of the pyramid, the base of 
which is the manifold representation, stands the conscious principle; 
but as the conscious principle is devoid of empirical content, it is, 
like the noumenon, an <i>x</i>, an unknown quantity. Descartes says "I 
think," but what, Kant asks, is the I? It is <i>the emptiest of all 
forms</i>, a psychological subject of conscious states, which never can 
become the logical subject of a predicate referring to these states or 
to anything else. <i>Empirical psychology</i>, which alone can extend 
our knowledge of mental life, does not aim at telling us anything about 
the ego; <i>rational psychology</i>, which does aim at establishing 
truths concerning the ego, is wrong in its very starting point and is 
full of contradictions in the course of its development.<p>

Kant, of course, does not deny the unity, substantiality, etc., of the 
soul; for he contends that reason is as far from being 
 <!--
538 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p538"></a>
 able to disprove as it is from being able to prove these truths, 
which, as the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i> will demonstrate, 
rest ultimately on man's moral consciousness.<p>

b. <i>Cosmological idea</i>. The totality of phenomena, or the world of 
which the cosmologists speak, presents, according to Kant, difficulties 
similar to those presented by the psychological idea. To every 
<i>thesis</i> which is formulated concerning the ultimate nature of 
matter, may be opposed an equally plausible <i>antithesis</i>. The 
<i>antinomies</i>, however, as these apparent contradictions are 
called, do not disprove the formal correctness of the inferential 
process employed in rational cosmology; they merely show that the 
cosmical concepts -- matter, cause, etc. -- extend beyond the limits 
of empirical knowledge and rational experience. The antinomies are 
four, corresponding to the four classes of categories: 
<blockquote><p>

alpha. Thesis: The world must have a beginning in time and be inclosed 
in finite space. Antithesis: The world is eternal and infinite.<p>

beta. Thesis: Matter is ultimately divisible into simple parts (atoms 
or monads) incapable of further division. Antithesis. Every material 
thing is divisible; there exists nowhere in the world anything simple.<p>

gamma. Thesis: Besides the causality which is according to the laws of 
nature and, therefore, necessary, there is causality which is free. 
Antithesis: There is no freedom; everything in the world takes place 
entirely according to the laws of nature.<p>

delta. Thesis: There exists an absolutely necessary Being belonging to 
the world, either as a part or as a cause of it. Antithesis. There 
nowhere exists an absolutely necessary Being, either within or without 
the world.  
</blockquote><p>

It is only in the case of the first two antinomies that Kant considers 
both the <i>thesis</i> and <i>antithesis</i> to be false.<p>

c. <i>Theological idea</i>. The idea of God is, according to Kant, the 
ideal of reason, that is, the expression of the need which reason has 
of coming to a perfect unity. Kant nowhere denies the objective 
validity of this idea; he contends, however, as we shall see, that it 
rests on the moral consciousness, not on any speculative basis. The 
criticism of the theological idea is, 
 <!--
KANT'S CRITICISM OF THE IDEA OF GOD 539 
 --><A NAME="p539"></a>
 therefore, confined to an examination of the <i>ontological, 
cosmological</i>, and <i>physico-theological</i> proofs which natural 
theology brings forward to establish the thesis that God exists.<p>

The <i>ontological</i> proof, which was formulated successively by St. 
Anselm, Descartes, and Leibniz, deduces the existence of God from the 
concept which we are able to form of Him. Kant points out the 
impossibility of arguing from the idea of a thing to the existence of 
that thing. Existence, he observes, is not a quality or attribute of 
the same nature as goodness or greatness: it adds nothing to the 
content of the idea. "A hundred real thalers contain no more, as to 
concept, than a hundred possible ones." Besides, all existential 
propositions are synthetical, because existence is not a quality of an 
idea, but a relation between the idea and experience. Therefore an 
existential proposition cannot be demonstrated from a concept without 
reference to experience.<p>

The <i>cosmological</i> proof argues from the existence of contingent 
being to the existence of necessary Being. Kant criticises the argument 
from the view point of his own theory of cognition. Since the axiom of 
causality, on which the argument rests, is a synthetic judgment, it 
cannot be applied beyond the limits of experience. "The principle of 
causality has no meaning and no criterion for its use beyond the world 
of sense, while here it is meant to help us beyond the world of 
sense."<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The <i>physico-theological</i> argument is that which is commonly 
called the argument from the purposiveness or design which is evident 
in the order of nature. Now, order and design "may prove the 
contingency of the form but not of the matter"; they may prove that 
there is a designer, but not that there is a creator, of the universe. 
Kant wishes to "commend and encourage" the use of such a line of 
reasoning, but he maintains that "it cannot by itself alone establish 
the existence of a Supreme Being."<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup>
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 540 
 --><A NAME="p540"></a><p>

The conclusion of the transcendental dialectic is, therefore, that 
<i>the ideas do not add to our experience</i>. Speculative philosophy 
does not add to our knowledge of the soul, the world, and God. 
Nevertheless, these ideas, although they do not constitute experience, 
regulate it, so that we cannot better order the faculties of the soul 
than by acting as if there were a soul; neither can we better order our 
experience of the external world than by representing it as made up of 
a multiplicity of created things, each of which stands to the rest of 
reality in reciprocal relation necessitated by law, and all of which 
spring from a common ground of unity and are ruled by the same guiding 
principle. Moreover, the criticism of the ideas shows that, while 
speculative philosophy is unable to establish the existence of God, the 
immortality of the soul, and the freedom of the will, materialism, 
fatalism, and atheism are equally unable to overthrow our belief in the 
truth of these doctrines. The ideas therefore clear the way for a 
rational faith founded on the moral consciousness.<p>

Before we come to the constructive portion of Kant's philosophy as 
contained in the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>, we may here sum 
up the results of his destructive criticism of speculative philosophy 
and of theoretical knowledge in general. There is <i>no transcendent 
knowledge</i>, -- no knowledge beyond the limits of experience. In our 
knowledge of the empirical world there is, however, <i>a transcendental 
element</i>, -- the <i>a priori</i> forms of sensation, the categories 
and the regulative ideas, which make empirical knowledge possible, 
although they do not add to it either in content or in extension. The 
moral consciousness alone takes us beyond experience to the immutable, 
eternal, and universally valid ground on which all higher truth rests.<p>

<b>Critique of Practical Reason</b>. When we pass from the <i>Critique 
of Pure Reason</i> to the <i>Critique of Practical Reason</i>, from the 
study of what is, or must be, to the study of what ought to be, from 
the inquiry into the conditions of possible theoretical experience to 
the inquiry into the conditions of actual moral 
 <!--
KANT'S CRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON 541 
 --><A NAME="p541"></a>
 experience, from the analysis of thought to the analysis of action, we 
find ourselves in an altogether new atmosphere. The second 
<i>Critique</i> discovers in the obligation of the moral law the 
<i>aliquid inconcussibile</i>, which, as the first <i>Critique</i> 
taught us, is not to be found in rational speculation; and thus are 
restored the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and the 
freedom of the will, which in the first <i>Critique</i> were relegated 
to the rank of mere regulative formulas.<p>

Kant's emphatic assertion of the <i>supremacy of the moral law</i> is 
well known. The starry heaven above us and the moral law within us are, 
he was accustomed to say, the only objects worthy of supreme 
admiration. But on what is the moral law founded? Consciousness tells 
me that I ought to perform certain actions, and a little thought 
suffices to convince me that the <i>oughtness</i> is <i>universal and 
necessary</i>. If I analyze, for example, the sense of obligation in 
the negative principle, Lie not, I find that, apart from the question 
of motive or utility, which are contingent determinants, it is a 
principle valid throughout all time and space. Now it is these 
properties, necessity and universality, that will enable us to answer 
the question, On what is the moral law founded?<p>

It is necessary, however, to remark that, according to Kant, the 
<i>universality and necessity affect the form, not the contents</i>, of 
the moral law, so that in the example just mentioned the universality 
of the prohibition, Lie not, is derived from the general formula, into 
which all obligation is translatable, -- So act that you can will that 
the maxim on which your conduct rests should become a universal 
law.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> More simply, the maxim on which your conduct rests must be fit 
to be an element of universal legislation.<p> 

The moral law is <i>not founded on pleasure</i>; for nothing is more 
unstable than feeling, which is the determinant of pleasure,  
 <!--
542 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p542"></a>
 whereas the moral law, because of its universality and necessity, must 
rest on an unchangeable foundation. It is <i>not founded on 
happiness</i>; for the essential characteristic of the moral law is its 
obligatoriness, and no one is obliged to be happy. It is <i>not founded 
on a moral sense</i>; for mere sense cannot represent obligation as 
necessary and universal. Finally, it is <i>not founded on perfection of 
self</i>; for perfection is, in final analysis, reducible to pleasure 
or happiness.<p>

The moral law is <i>its own foundation</i>; it is autonomous, being 
neither imposed by any external motive, nor deduced by the purely 
speculative reason from theoretical principles, but being impressed on 
the will by the practical reason<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> and revealed to us by immediate 
consciousness. Thus it stands on a basis firmer than that which 
theoretical knowledge can furnish, and it remains unaffected by the 
contention and clamor of metaphysical discussion.<p>

The moral law is <i>imperative</i>: consciousness reveals it to us as 
commanding, not merely as persuading or advising. Its command may be 
<i>categorical</i>, as, Thou shalt not lie! or <i>hypothetical</i>, as, 
If you wish to become a clergyman you must study theology. The 
categorical imperative is, however, the characteristic expression of 
the moral law, and it is only in the authoritative though "hollow" 
voice of the universal categorical imperative, So act, etc., that the 
moral law speaks with all the authority of a universal and necessary 
moral determinant.<p>

The moral law is the form which imparts to the contents of an action 
its goodness. The contents may be good relatively; the will, which is 
the form, is an absolute good. "Nothing," Kant observes, "can be called 
good without qualification except a good will." Effects and 
circumstances are not, therefore, of themselves, determinants of moral 
value: the sense of duty is alone praiseworthy. The only moral motive 
is respect for 
 <!--
KANT'S CRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON 543
 --><A NAME="p543"></a>
 the moral law. Thus does Kant carry his reverence for the moral law to 
the extreme of purism, -- the exclusion of all egotistic motive as 
derogatory to the moral worth of actions.<p>

The moral law is <i>unconditional</i>; in the form of the categorical 
imperative, its voice is unconditionally authoritative and its command 
is unconditionally a law of human conduct. It speaks to us immediately, 
for we are conscious of its commands. Here, then, we have found 
something which metaphysicians have sought in vain, -- an 
incontrovertible truth on which the freedom of the will, the existence 
of God, and the immortality of the soul may be made to rest.<p>

First, <i>the will is free</i>; for the moral law, in saying Thou 
oughtest, implies that Thou canst. We have no immediate consciousness 
of freedom, but we have immediate consciousness of the moral law which 
implies freedom. I can because I ought, and I know that I can because I 
know that I ought. Freedom is, therefore, the <i>ratio essendi</i> of the 
moral law, and the moral law is the <i>ratio cognoscendi</i> of 
freedom.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Secondly, the moral law postulates the <i>existence of God</i>; for the 
imperative nature of the moral law implies that there exists somewhere 
a good which is not only supreme but complete (<i>consummatum</i>), an 
embodiment, so to speak, of that perfect holiness which is the sum of 
all the conditions implied in the moral order. Thus, while theonomic 
ethics supposes the existence of God, autonomic morality <i>proves</i> 
His existence.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Thirdly, the moral law postulates the <i>immortality of the soul</i>. 
Theoretical reason, as we have seen, fails to determine in any manner 
the noumenal reality of the subject of our conscious states; but surely 
the practical reason, which imposes its law so imperiously, is a 
noumenal reality, of which its every action is a determination. Thus, 
the soul is immortal because immortal duration is alone sufficient for 
the complete fulfillment of the moral law. The highest perfection that 
we can attain in this 
 <!--
544 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p544"></a>
 life is <i>virtue</i>, and virtue is essentially incomplete: it is a 
striving towards <i>holiness</i>, with a residual inclination towards 
unholiness. Since the moral law will always continue with the same 
unrelenting imperativeness to urge the soul towards holiness, and since 
the inclination towards unholiness will never be completely overcome, 
the struggle between the desire to obey and the impulse to transgress 
the law must continue forever.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The three postulates of the moral law restore, therefore, freedom, 
immortality, and theistic belief, which find no justifiable basis in 
the speculative reason. But which are we to believe, the theoretical or 
the practical reason? Kant does not hesitate to reply: we are to 
believe the practical reason, for it is supreme. Faith is a rational 
conviction based on the sense of duty, and is not less but rather more 
valid than the conviction based on theoretical knowledge.<p>

This is not the place to take up Kant's theory of natural religion. It 
is sufficient to note that, as the principle enunciated at the end of 
the preceding paragraph implies, religion, according to Kant, is based 
on ethics. We come, then, to the third of Kant's philosophical 
critiques.<p>

<b>Critique of the Faculty of Judgment</b>. The understanding (pure 
reason) is the faculty of <i>a priori</i> forms and principles of 
knowledge. Practical reason is the faculty of <i>a priori</i> 
principles of action. Mediating, as it were, between these is judgment 
(in the stricter sense of the word), which is the faculty of the <i>a 
priori</i> forms and principles of aesthetic feeling. In other words, 
the <i>beautiful</i>, or <i>purposive</i>, which is the object of 
judgment, is intermediate between the true and the good, which are the 
objects of pure reason and practical reason respectively. 
<i>Judgment</i> may be defined as the faculty by which we subsume the 
particular under the universal (law), or find the universal under which 
the particular is to be arranged. It refers the manifold to the one, 
the sensible order to the supersensible 
 <!--
KANT'S CRITIQUE OF JUDGMENT 545  
 --><A NAME="p545"></a>
 principle of <i>design</i>, and since all actualization of design 
produces in us the sentiment of the <i>beautiful</i>, the faculty of 
judgment is also concerned with the aesthetic aspect of nature and art. 
We have, then, as divisions of the critique of judgment, (I) critique 
of the teleological judgment, and (2) critique of the aesthetic 
judgment.<p>

A. <i>Critique of the Teleological Judgment</i>. The <i>analytic</i> of 
the teleological judgment has for its scope to determine the different 
kinds of <i>adaptation</i>. These, Kant observes, are two, 
<i>external</i> and <i>internal</i>. External adaptation, such as that 
of the pine to the soil on which it grows, may be explained by 
mechanical causes; but internal adaptation, which is found in organic 
structure and function, cannot be explained by mechanical causes alone. 
There is in the organism a relation of part to part and of part to the 
whole, but no causal relation to anything outside the organism; so that 
the organism is at once cause and effect. We cannot explain organic 
activity in terms of mechanical causality; we can understand it only on 
the supposition that organisms act <i>as though</i> they were produced 
by a cause which had a purpose in view. The teleological concept is, 
therefore, regulative of our experience.<p>

That the teleological concept is merely regulative, not constitutive, 
of experience appears from the <i>antinomy</i>, of which Kant treats in 
the <i>dialectic</i> of the teleological judgment. The antinomy is as 
follows: <i>Thesis</i>: All productions of material things and their 
forms may be explained by mechanical causes. <i>Antithesis</i>: Some 
products of material nature cannot be judged possible unless we suppose 
a final cause. Now, as doctrines, mechanism (as opposed to teleology) 
and teleology are irreconcilable; but as rules or maxims <i>regulative 
of our experience</i>, one is supplementary of the other.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup><p>

B. <i>Critique of the Aesthetic Judgment</i>. The name judgment applied 
to the aesthetic faculty is evidence of the purpose of this 
 <!--
546 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p546"></a>
 portion of Kant's philosophy, the purpose, namely, to mediate between 
the sensationalists, who reduced beauty to mere feeling, and the 
rationalists, who removed all feeling from the faculty of aesthetic 
appreciation.<p>

a. In his <i>analytic</i> of the aesthetic judgment, Kant determines 
that, as to <i>quality</i>, the beautiful is the object of 
disinterested satisfaction (wherein it differs from the agreeable and 
the good); with regard to <i>quantity</i>, it pleases universally 
(wherein it differs from the agreeable) ; with regard to 
<i>relation</i>, it is not based on concepts (wherein it differs from 
the good, that being beautiful in which we find the form or design 
without representing to ourselves any particular design); finally, with 
regard to <i>modality</i>, its pleases necessarily (wherein again it 
differs from the agreeable). That, then, is <i>beautiful</i>, which 
<i>universally and necessarily gives disinterested pleasure without the 
concept of definite design</i>. The satisfaction which we find in what 
is perfect is intellectual or conceptual; the satisfaction which the 
beautiful affords is emotional or aesthetic.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The <i>sublime</i> is that which is <i>great beyond all comparison</i>; 
it gives satisfaction by its boundless and formless greatness, as the 
beautiful does by its definiteness of form. This greatness is either 
extensive in space or time or intensive in force or power. The great 
produces, it is true, a "humiliating" impression; but it is the 
sensitive nature that is humiliated, while at the same time the 
spiritual nature is exalted and carried out towards the idea of the 
Infinite, which the sublime always suggests.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup><p>

b. In the <i>dialectic</i> of the aesthetic faculty, Kant insists that 
the highest use of the sublime and beautiful is their use as a 
<i>symbol of moral good</i>. For the aesthetic feeling is akin to the 
moral faculty, as indeed the teleological judgment also is. The 
question of the objective value of one or other of these faculties 
leads ultimately to the assertion that there is hidden in nature 
 <!--
HISTORICAL POSITION OF KANT 547
 --><A NAME="p547"></a>
 a principle of beauty and purpose and goodness which the speculative 
reason cannot formulate.<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Kant's influence on the development of 
thought in the nineteenth century can hardly be overestimated. His 
philosophy is, as it were, the watershed from which streams of thought 
flow down in various courses into modern idealism, agnosticism, and 
even materialism. To this source may also be traced some of the most 
noteworthy currents of contemporary religious thought, especially the 
movement towards nondogmatic Christianity; for it is not difficult to 
see in Kant's assertion of the supremacy of the moral law the origin of 
the tendency to regard Christianity more as a system of ethics and less 
as a system of dogmatic truth. Kant influenced not only the literature 
of his own country, to an extent unequaled perhaps in the history of 
that literature, but also, through his English exponents, of whom 
Coleridge was the chief, the literature of the English-speaking world.<p>

Philosophy owes to Kant the energetic assertion of the grandeur of the 
moral law as the foundation of ethics, and the scarcely less energetic 
assertion of the essential unity of consciousness, as a point of view 
for the critical analysis of mental processes. Whether or not we admit 
with McCosh that "Kant was distinguished more as a logical thinker and 
systematizer than as a careful observer of what actually takes place in 
the mind,"<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> or with Huxley that "his baggage train is bigger than his 
army, and the student who attacks him is too often led to suspect that 
he has won a position when he has only captured a mob of useless
 camp-followers,"<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> we cannot deny that Kant revolutionized the world 
of speculative and practical thought by introducing a new point of view 
for the study of mental phenomena, and that, to this extent at least, 
he is, as he himself claimed to he, the Copernicus of mental science. 
 <!--
548 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p548"></a><p>

Kant inaugurated transcendental criticism. Now, criticism in the sense 
of a critical examination of experience, or the analysis of common 
consciousness, is undoubtedly the beginning of philosophical inquiry, 
and the critical investigation of knowledge is a starting point which 
philosophic method approves. But philosophic method cannot approve the 
attempt to criticise all knowledge without the aid of principles or 
standards of criticism, and such principles or standards Kant does not 
pretend to adopt. We cannot regard as a canon of criticism the 
assumption that what is necessary and universal in our knowledge must 
be <i>a priori</i>, -- an assumption which is untrue as to content. Yet 
it is to this assumption that Kant constantly recurs in his doctrine of 
categories, in his classification of certain judgments as synthetic and 
<i>a priori</i>, etc. It is only in the practical order, in the realm 
of moral consciousness, that Kant finds refuge from the
 pan-phenomenalism which he wishes to avoid; for the thing-in-itself, 
the subject, and God, though existing, are unknown and unknowable, as 
far as the speculative reason is concerned. Kant, whose express purpose 
was to deliver philosophy from scepticism, might well look back at 
Hume, the sceptic, and exclaim, "There, but for the categorical 
imperative, goes Immanuel Kant!"<p>
