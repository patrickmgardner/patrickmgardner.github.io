THE SCHOOL OF AUXERRE</h3><p>

ERIC (HEIRICUS) OF AUXERRE<p>

<b>Life</b>. St. Eric (841-881?), a monk of St. Germain of Auxerre, 
studied at Fulda, where he had for teacher Haimo, the successor of 
Rhabanus, and afterwards at Ferri&egrave;res, where Servatus Lupus, who 
was also a disciple of Rhabanus, was at that time master. After 
returning to Auxerre, Eric became master in the monastic school ot that 
place, and under his guidance the school became one of the most 
renowned in all France.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Haur&eacute;au<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> has shown that the marginal glosses 
found in manuscript, No. 108, of the National Library of Paris are the 
work of Eric. The manuscript contains the <i>Categoriae Decem</i> 
(falsely attributed to St. Augustine), the <i>Perihermenias</i> of 
Aristotle, the <i>Isagoge</i> of Porphyry, and several works of 
Boethius. Naturally, therefore, the glosses added by Eric deal
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p262"></a>
 almost exclusively with logical or dialectical problems. In addition 
to this document, Haur&eacute;au mentions a poem by Eric on the life of 
St. Germain, to which the author attached, as a marginal note, an 
extract from Erigena's treatise <i>De Divisione Naturae</i>. The poem 
is published by Migne, <i>Patr. Lat.</i>, Vol. CXXIX.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Eric affirms with Aristotle and Boethius that the concept is the image 
of the object, while the word is the expression of the concept. "Rem 
concipit intellectus, intellectum voces designant, voces autem litterae
significant." With regard to the universal (generic and specific) 
concept, he expresses himself as follows:<p>

<blockquote>
Genus non praedicari (de animali) secundum rem (id est substantiam) sed 
designativum esse nomen animalis quo designatur animal de pluribus 
specie differentibus dici. Namque neque rationem animalis potest habere 
genus, cum dicitur animal est substantia animata et sensibilis. 
Similiter, neque species dicitur de homine secundum id quod significat, 
sed juxta illud quod de numero differentibus praedicatur.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

This passage indicates a departure from the realistic view and a 
leaning towards the nominalism which appeared in more definite form in 
the eleventh century. In a similar spirit Eric accounts for the 
collocation of individual things in genera and species, and even in the 
highest genus, <i>ousia</i>.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> In Eric's glosses there are several 
indications of an acquaintance with the writings of Erigena. His 
doctrines may be described in general as a protest against the extreme 
realism of his predecessor.<p>

REMI OF AUXERRE<p>

<b>Life</b>. St. Remi (Remigius) of Auxerre was a monk of the abbey of 
St. Germain of Auxerre. He had for teacher Eric of Auxerre and Servatus 
Lupus. After the death of Eric be taught at Auxerre, Rheims, and Paris. 
At the last-mentioned school he had for disciple Otho of Cluny. He died 
in 904. 
 <!--
REMI OF AUXERRE 263  
 --><A NAME="p263"></a><p>

<b>Sources</b>. Besides a theological treatise entitled <i>Enarrationes 
in Psalmos</i>, we possess Remi's <i>Glosses</i> on the grammatical 
works of Priscian and Donatus and a dialectical commentary, entitled 
<i>Commentum Magistri Remigii super Librum Martiani Capellae de Nuptiis 
Mercurii et Philologiae et super Septem Artes Liberales</i>. As a 
secondary source we have the biography of Otho of Cluny by the monk 
John.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

From the commentary on Martianus Capella it appears that Remi attempted 
to <i>reconcile the extreme realism of Erigena with the anti-realism of 
Eric</i>. Martianus Capella had defined genus as "multarum formarum per 
unum nomen complexio." Erigena, on the contrary, had defined it as 
"multarum formarum substantialis unitas." The definition given by Remi 
is evidently a compromise. "Genus est complexio, id est adlectio et 
comprehensio, multarum formarum."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Remi seems to have occupied himself with the problem of the world of 
Ideas. The Ideas, he maintained, exist in an invisible sphere, hidden 
in the mind of God.<p>

<blockquote>
Per sphaeram (Martianus) vult intelligi mundum invisibilem qui in mente 
Dei latebat antequam iste visibilis per varias produceretur causas; 
quem mundum, id est invisibilem, philosophi vocant ideas, id est 
formas.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

Associated with the school of Auxerre is the unknown author of another 
Commentary on Madianus Capella. This commentary, on account of the 
frequent occurrence of Greek words, is judged by some to be the work of 
an Irish monk.<p>

Mention must also be made of a work entitled <i>Glosses on the Isagoge 
of Porphyry</i>, discovered by Cousin and by him assigned to the ninth 
century. Both Cousin and Haur&eacute;au attribute the work to Rhabanus 
Maurus; Prantl, Kaulich, and St&ouml;ckl are of opinion that it should 
be assigned to a pupil of Rhabanus who 
 <!--
264 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p264"></a>
 is called <i>Iepa</i>.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> On the question of universals the author of 
the <i>Glosses</i> propounds certain realistic principles which 
approach more closely to what afterwards became known as Thomistic 
realism than do any of the tenets of the other dialecticians of the 
ninth or tenth centuries.<p>

<blockquote>
Genus et species subsistunt alio modo, intelliguntur alio. Et sunt 
incorporalia; sed sensibilibus juncta subsistunt in sensibilibus, et 
tunc est singulare; intelliguntur ut ipsa substantia, ut non in aliis 
esse suum habentia, et tunc est universale.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. During the ninth and tenth centuries the philosophy 
which formed part of the general intellectual movement inaugurated by 
the foundation of the schools was still in its beginnings. Here and 
there different springs gave rise to different streams of thought, but 
it was not until the following century that these streams began to flow 
in a common channel, and the philosophy of the schools, uniting all its 
tributaries, took a definite course, the direction of which may be 
easily traced. Rhabanus, Erigena, Gerbert, and the monks of Auxerre are 
practically independent of one another; yet each in his own way 
exhibits the essential traits of the Scholastic, vague and ill-defined 
as these traits are, when compared with the characteristics of the 
Scholasticism of the thirteenth century: All these philosophers agree 
in maintaining that there is no contradiction between philosophy and 
theology; they hold that dialectic should be applied to the great 
problems of human thought and they all attempt, on a more or less 
restricted scale, to make faith reasonable. Scholasticism in the ninth 
century draws the first rough sketch of what Scholasticism in the 
thirteenth century will be.<p>

This period is generally described as "an age of blind realism"; but it 
is far from being so. True it is that Erigena's  
 <!--
THE PROBLEM OF UNIVERSALS 265
 --><A NAME="p265"></a>
 philosophy, the most ambitious constructive attempt of the ninth 
century, is based on the realistic concept of the universe; but it must 
be remembered that Erigena's realism did not go uncontradicted, and 
while Eric, Remi, and the author of the <i>Glosses</i> did not succeed 
in finding the formula best fitted to express the doctrine of moderate 
realism, they refused with unmistakable emphasis to accept the 
 ultra-realistic concept. It was through the storm and stress of the 
age of Roscelin and Abelard that moderate realism struggled to an 
adequate expression. In that age, too, there first appeared 
rationalism, which, in a sense to be subsequently explained, is 
regarded by Cardinal Gonz&aacute;lez as an essential phase of the 
Scholastic movement. The occasion of the extraordinary intellectual 
activity of the second period of Scholasticism was the problem of 
universals.<p>
