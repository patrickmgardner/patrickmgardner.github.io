THE PYTHAGOREAN SCHOOL</h3><p>

About the time the Ionic philosophy attained its highest development in 
Asia Minor, another phase of philosophical thought appeared in the 
Greek colonies of Italy. As we turn to the Pythagorean philosophy, the 
first philosophy of the West, we are struck with the importance which 
the ethico-religious aspect assumes from the outset; philosophy now is 
not so much an inquiry into the causes of things as a  
 <!--
THE PYTHAGOREAN SCHOOL 39
 --><A NAME="p39"></a>
 rule of life, a way of salvation. It is remarkable, too, that this 
notion of philosophy never wholly died out in the subsequent 
development of Greek thought. Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics 
constantly referred philosophy to life as well as to knowledge.<p>

The Pythagorean system of speculation is sometimes contrasted with the 
Ionian as being an embodiment of the Doric spirit, which was artistic, 
conservative, ethical, while the Greeks of the Ionian colonies were 
characterized by worldly sense, versatility, curiosity, and commercial 
enterprise. Both philosophies, however, are wholly Greek.<p>

<i>Life of Pythagoras</i>. Samos was the home and probably the 
birthplace of Pythagoras. It is certain that he journeyed to Italy 
about the year 530 B.C., and that he founded in Crotona a
 philosophico-religious society. The story of his journey through 
Egypt, Persia, India, and Gaul is part of the Neo-Pythagorean legend, 
though there is good reason for believing that the account of his 
death at Metapontum is true.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. <i>Primary sources</i>. The Neo-Pythagoreans mention an 
extensive Pythagorean literature as dating from the days of the 
founder. Modern scholarship has, however, shown that (1) the <i>reputed 
writings of Pythagoras</i> are certainly spurious; (2) the <i>fragments 
of Philolaus</i> (<b>peri phusi&ocirc;s</b>) are for the most part 
genuine: it was probably from these that Aristotle derived his 
knowledge of the Pythagorean doctrines; Philolaus lived towards the end 
of the fifth century; (3) the <i>fragments of Archytas of Tarentum</i> 
are spurious, with the exception of a few, which do not add to our 
knowledge of the Pythagorean doctrines, as they bear too evident marks 
of Platonic influence.<p>

<i>Secondary sources</i>.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> There is no school the history of which is 
so overgrown with legend as the Pythagorean. Indeed, Pythagoras and his 
disciples are seldom mentioned by writers anterior to Plato and 
Aristotle, and even the latter does not mention Pythagoras more than 
once or twice; he speaks rather of the Pythagoreans. Thus, the nearer 
we approach the time of Pythagoras the more scanty do our data become, 
while the farther the tradition is removed from Pythagoras the fuller 
they grow. Obviously, therefore, the Neo-Pythagoreans of the first 
century B.C. are not to be relied on when they speak of Pythagoras and 
his doctrines.

40 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY

<b>The Pythagorean School</b> was a society formed for an
 ethico-religious purpose. It was governed by a set of rules (<b>ho 
tropos tou biou</b>). The members recognized one another by means of 
secret signs; simplicity of personal attire and certain restrictions in 
matter of diet were required. Celibacy and the strict observance of 
secrecy in matters of doctrine were also insisted upon. The political 
tendency of the school was towards the aristocratic party in Magna 
Graecia, a tendency which led to the persecution and final dispersion of 
the society.<p>

PYTHAGOREAN DOCTRINES<p>

All that can with certainty be traced to Pythagoras is the doctrine of 
metempsychosis, the institution of certain ethical rules, and the germ 
idea of the mathematico-theological speculation, which was afterwards 
carried to a high degree of development. Consequently, by Pythagorean 
doctrines we must understand the doctrines of the disciples of 
Pythagoras, though these referred nearly all their doctrines to the 
founder. (Indeed, they carried this practice so far that they 
constantly introduced a question by quoting the <b>autos epha</b>, the 
<i>ipse dixit</i> of the Master.)<p>

<b>The Number Theory</b>. The most distinctive of the Pythagorean 
doctrines is the principle that number is the essence and basis 
(arch&ecirc;) of all things. To this conclusion the Pythagoreans were 
led "by contemplating with minds trained to mathematical concepts" the 
order of nature and the regularity of natural changes.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

To the question, Did the Pythagoreans regard numbers as the physical 
substance of things, or merely as symbols or prototypes? the answer 
seems to be that they meant number to stand to things in the double 
relation of prototype and substance. And if the assertion, "All is 
number," sounds strange to us, we must consider how profound was the 
impression produced on the minds of these early students of nature by 
the  
 <!--
THE PYTHAGOREAN SCHOOL 41
 --><A NAME="p41"></a>
 first perception of the unalterable universal order of natural 
changes. Then we shall cease to wonder at the readiness with which 
number -- the formula of the order and regularity of those changes -- 
was hypostatized into the substance and basis of all things that 
change.<p>

Philolaus (frag. 3) distinguishes three natural kinds of number: odd, 
even, and the odd-even. Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> says that the Pythagoreans 
considered odd and even to be the elements  (<b>stoicheia</b>)<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> of 
number. "Of these," he continues, "the one is definite and the other is 
unlimited, and the unit is the product of both, for it is both odd and 
even, and number arises from the unit, and the whole heaven is 
number."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> From the dualism which is thus inherent in the unit, and 
consequently in number, comes the doctrine of opposites, finite and 
infinite, odd and even, left and right, male and female, and so forth. 
From the doctrine of opposites proceeds the notion of harmony, which 
plays such an important part in the Pythagorean philosophy, for harmony 
is the union of opposites.<p>

<b>Application of the Doctrine of Number</b>: 1. <i>To physics</i>. 
True to their mathematical concept of the world, the Pythagoreans 
analyzed bodies into surfaces, surfaces into lines, and lines into 
points. From this, however, we must not conclude that they conceived 
the numerical unit of all things as material; they apparently used 
numbers and geometrical quantities merely as quantities, abstracting 
from their contents, that is, without determining whether the contents 
were material or immaterial, a distinction which belongs to a later date.<p>

Every body is an expression of the number four; the surface is three, 
because the triangle is the simplest of figures; the line is two, 
because of its terminations; and the point is  
 <!--
42 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p42"></a>
 one. Ten is the perfect number, because it is the sum of the numbers 
from one to four.<p>

2. <i>To the theory of music</i>. The application of the number theory 
to the arrangement of tones is obvious. The story,<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> however, of the 
discovery of the musical scale by Pythagoras, as told by Iamblichus and 
others, is one of many instances in which discoveries made by the 
successors of Pythagoras were attributed to Pythagoras himself.<p>

3. <i>To cosmology</i>. Not only is each body a number, but the entire 
universe is an arrangement of numbers, the basis of which is the 
perfect number, ten. For the universe consists of ten bodies,  --  the 
five planets, the sun, the moon, the heaven of the fixed stars, the 
earth, and the counter-earth (<b>antichth&ocirc;n</b>). The earth is a 
sphere; the counter-earth, which is postulated in order to fill up the 
number ten, is also a sphere, and moves parallel to the earth. In the 
center of the universe is the central fire, around which the heavenly 
bodies, fixed in their spheres, revolve from west to east, while around 
all is the peripheral fire. This motion of the heavenly bodies is 
regulated as to velocity, and is therefore a harmony. We do not, 
however, perceive this harmony of the spheres, either because we are 
accustomed to it, or because the sound is too intense to affect our 
organs of hearing.<p>

4. <i>To psychology</i>. It would seem that the early Pythagoreans 
taught nothing definite regarding the nature of the soul. In the 
<i>Phaedo</i>,<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Plato introduces into the dialogue a disciple of 
Philolaus, who teaches that the soul is a harmony, while Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> 
says: "Some of them (the Pythagoreans) say that the soul is identified 
with the corpuscles in the air, and others say that it is that which 
moves (<b>to kinoun</b>) the corpuscles." The idea, however, that the soul 
is a harmony seems to be part of the doctrine of the Pythagoreans. The 
<i>transmigration of souls</i> 
 <!--
THE PYTHAGOREAN SCHOOL 43 
 --><A NAME="p43"></a>
 is, as has been said, traceable to the founder of the school, though 
it was probably held as a tradition, being derived from the mysteries 
without being scientifically connected with the idea of the soul or 
with the number theory.<p>

5. <i>To theology</i>. The Pythagoreans did not make extensive 
application of their number theory to their theological beliefs. They 
seem to have conformed, externally at least, to the popular religious 
notions, though there are indications of a system of purer religious 
concepts which were maintained esoterically.<p>

6. <i>To ethics</i>. The ethical system of the Pythagoreans was 
thoroughly religious. The supreme good of man is to become godlike. 
This assimilation is to be accomplished by virtue. Now virtue is a 
harmony: it essentially consists in a harmonious equilibrium of the 
faculties, by which what is lower in man's nature is subordinated to 
what is higher. Knowledge, the practice of asceticism, music, and 
gymnastics are the means by which this harmony is attained. Finally, 
the Pythagoreans used numbers to define ethical notions. Thus, they 
said, juslice is a number squared, <b>arithmos isakis isos</b>.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The chief importance of the Pythagorean 
movement lies in this, that it marks a deepening of the moral 
consciousness in Greece. The old-time buoyancy of religious feeling as 
seen in the Homeric poems has given way to a calmer and more reflective 
mood, in which the sense of guilt and the consequent need of atonement 
and purification assert themselves.<p>

As a system of philosophy, the body of Pythagorean doctrine must, like 
all the pre-Socratic systems, be regarded as primarily intended to be a 
philosophy of nature, and this is how Aristotle describes it.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> It is 
not concerned with the conditions of knowledge, and although the 
society which Pythagoras founded was ethical, the philosophy which is 
associated 
 <!--
44 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p44"></a>
 with that society treats of ethical problems only incidentally and in 
a superficial manner.<p>

As an investigation of nature the Pythagorean philosophy must be 
pronounced a very decided advance on the speculative attempts of the 
Ionians. The Pythagoreans leave the concrete, sense-perceived basis of 
existence, and substitute for it the abstract notion of number, thus 
preparing the way for a still higher notion -- that of Being.<p>
