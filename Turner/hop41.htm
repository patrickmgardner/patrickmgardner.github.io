JOHN DUNS SCOTUS</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. John Duns Scotus, <i>Doctor Subtilis</i>, the most gifted 
opponent of Thomism, rises above the plane of mere controversialists 
and takes rank among the great schoolmen, if not among the greatest. He 
was born, according to some writers, in 1266; according to others, in 
1274. Where he was born is also uncertain, the most common opinion 
being that England was his birthplace.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> At an early age he entered 
the Franciscan order, and made his studies at Oxford, where the
 Anti-Thomistic party was for the time triumphant. From 1294 to 1304 he 
taught at Oxford. In 1304 he began to teach in Paris; in 1308 he was 
transferred to Cologne, where he died the same year.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Both at Oxford 
and at Paris Scotus enjoyed a reputation as a teacher which was 
unequaled by even the greatest of his predecessors.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The <i>Opus Oxoniense</i>, which together with other 
works was composed while Scotus was at Oxford, is a commentary on the 
<i>Books of Sentences</i>. The works, or rather the lecture notes, 
which he composed at Paris were collected by his disciples under the 
title <i>Reportata Parisiensia</i>, or <i>Opus Parisiense</i>. The 
complete works of Scotus were published by Luke Wadding, Lyons, 1639. 
This edition was reprinted by Vives, Paris, 1891.  Monograph: Pluzanski, 
<i>La philosophie de Duns Scotus</i>, Paris, 1887.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup>

388 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p388"></a><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

The philosophy of Duns Scotus is characterized by <i>criticism</i> and 
<i>subtlety</i>. Owing, perhaps, to his predilection for mathematical 
studies -- a predilection which is said to be due to the influence of 
Roger Bacon -- Scotus was too much inclined to reject as inconclusive 
the philosophical arguments of his predecessors. He attacked, without 
distinction of school, and, apparently, without the least respect for 
the prestige of a great name, the doctrines of Alexander of Hales, St. 
Bonaventure, Roger Bacon, Henry of Ghent, and, above all, St. Thomas. 
Such is the subtlety of his speculations that even the mind trained in 
Scholastic modes of thought has considerable difficulty in following 
his line of reasoning.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Philosophy and Theology</b>. Scotus, while agreeing with St. Thomas 
that philosophy and theology are distinct sciences, insists on the 
inferiority of the former, maintaining that human reason is incapable 
of solving such problems as the immortality of the soul. Indeed, his 
doctrine on this point comes dangerously near to the Averroistic 
principle that what is true in theology may be false in philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Divine Attributes</b>. St. Thomas taught that there exists only a 
<i>distinctio rationis</i>, or logical distinction, between the divine 
nature and the divine attributes, -- justice, power, etc. Scotus 
maintains that the distinction in question is not merely logical, 
neither is it real, but something which is partly real and partly 
logical -- <i>distinctio formalis a parte rei</i>. This celebrated 
distinction, sometimes referred to as the Scotistic distinction, is not 
easy to understand. Its opponents contend that it implies a 
contradiction. It is more than logical, for it exists <i>a parte 
rei</i>, independently of the mind; and it is less than real, for it  
 <!--
JOHN DUNS SCOTUS 389 
 --><A NAME="p389"></a>
 is a distinction not of things, but merely of formalities, which may 
exist in one and the same thing, as, for example, the distinction 
between animality and rationality in man.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup><p>

According to Scotus, the essence of things, as well as their existence, 
depends, not on the divine intellect, but on the divine will.<p>

<b>Matter and Form</b>. Scotus revives the doctrine of universal 
matter, which the first Franciscan teachers had borrowed from 
Avicebrol:<p>

<blockquote>
Ego autem ad positionem Avicembronis redeo; et primam partem, scil. 
quod in omnibus creatis per se subsistentibus tam corporalibus quam 
spiritualibus sit una materia, teneo.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

All created substances are, therefore, composed of matter and form. 
Scotus, with characteristic subtlety, distinguishes three kinds of 
<i>materia prima</i>:<p>

<blockquote>
Materia <i>primo-prima</i>, habens actum de se omnino indeterminatum 
respectu determinationis cujuslibet formae; materia <i>secundo-
prima</i>, quae est subjectum generationis et corruptionis, quam mutant 
agentia creata, seu Angeli seu agenda corruptibilia; materia <i>tertio-
prima</i>, quae est materia cujuslibet artis et materia cujuslibet 
agentis naturalis particularis.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

The substantial form is not, as St. Thomas taught, essentially one. It 
determines the matter to a higher mode of being; but this determination 
gives rise to an indetermination, or potency, with respect to a higher 
form; thus, the generic form leads to the specific, and the specific to 
the individual, so that the more complete is the determination of 
matter the greater is the <i>plurification of forms</i> in matter.<p>

<blockquote>
Omnis forma sive plurificatlo est de imperfecto et indeterminato ad 
perfectum et determinatum, de uno materiali ad plura formaliter 
distincta.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote>
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 390  
 --><A NAME="p390"></a><p>

<b>Doctrine of Universals</b>. In the <i>Quaestiones Acutissimae super 
Universalia Porphyrii</i><sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> Scotus develops a doctrine of moderate 
realism. In his metaphysical treatises he defends the plurality of 
substantial generic and specific forms (<i>formalitates</i>), which 
have an objective reality, and a kind of unity inferior to numerical 
unity. In this manner Scotus prepares the way for his followers, who 
built on his metaphysical doctrines a system of exaggerated 
realism.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Essence and Existence</b>. Between essence and existence there is, 
according to Scotus, a "distinctio formalis a parte rei."<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>The Principle of Individuation</b> is neither matter nor form nor 
quantity but an individual property added to these. This property was 
called by the Scotists the <i>thisness (haecceitas)</i> of a thing.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> 
Scotus denies the Thomistic doctrine that there cannot be two angels of 
the same species: "Simpliciter possibile est plures angelos esse in 
eadem specie."<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Voluntarism</b>. The philosophy of Scotus is voluntaristic in its 
entire spirit. Scotus explicitly teaches that the will is superior to 
the intellect. "Voluntas imperans intellectui est causa superior 
respectu actus ejus. Intellectus autem si est causa volitionis, est 
causa subserviens voluntati."<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> St. Thomas taught that the intuitive 
contemplation of the Divine Essence in the beatific vision is the 
principal and indeed the essential element in man's final happiness: 
Scotus teaches that it is by the act of perfect love of God in the next 
life that final happiness is to be attained. In a similar spirit of 
voluntarism, Scotus holds that 
 <!--
JOHN DUNS SCOTUS 391 
 --><A NAME="p391"></a>
 the natural law depends on the will of God and that actions are good 
because God has commanded them, while St. Thomas, true to the 
principles of intellectualism, taught that natural law depends on the 
mind of God, and that God commands certain actions because they are 
good. Scotus maintains that human reason alone cannot prove the 
omnipotence of God<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> and the immortality of the human soul: St. Thomas 
taught that these truths are demonstrable by reason.<p>

There are many other points of contrast between the tenets of the 
Subtle Doctor and those of the Angel of the Schools. The antithesis 
between the two great teachers is not to be explained by the "wish on 
the part of Brother John to contradict whatever Brother Thomas had 
taught": it is an antithesis arising out of the difference in the 
mental temperaments of the two men, the difference between an 
intellectualist and a voluntarist.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Scotus is frequently described as the Kant 
of Scholastic philosophy. He certainly resembles Kant in his refusal to 
accept without criticism any theory, no matter how universally received 
or how strongly supported by the authority of great names. The 
resemblance is accentuated by the fact that both Scotus and Kant are 
voluntarists, both maintaining that will is superior to intellect, and 
that human reason cannot demonstrate the truths which most vitally 
affect the destiny of man. But, remarkable as the resemblance is, no 
less striking is the contrast between the two philosophers. Kant 
appeals to the moral consciousness to prove the truths which reason 
cannot demonstrate: Scotus, on the contrary, appeals to revelation. 
Scotus places the supernatural order of truth above all philosophical 
knowledge, and consequently his criticism is partial and relative to 
the natural order of truth, while Kant's is radical and absolute. For 
Kant there is no court of appeal superior to the moral consciousness; 
for Scotus the supreme tribunal before which all truth is judged is 
divine revelation. 
 <!--
392 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p392"></a><p>

Scotus inaugurates an age of talent rather than of genius. The 
influence of St. Bonaventure, Albert, and St. Thomas seems to have 
silenced for a while the contentions which distracted the earlier 
schoolmen.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> But now that the great constructive thinkers have 
disappeared, the intellectual knight-errantry of Abelard's day once 
more comes into vogue, and minds incapable of constructive effort 
devote themselves to analysis and controversy. It is among these lesser 
lights that Scotus, subtle and penetrating as his mind was, must be 
classed. For, while he excelled even the greatest of the schoolmen in 
critical acumen, he was wanting in that synthetic power which St. 
Thomas possessed in so preeminent a degree, and which more than any 
other quality of mind stamps the writer or thinker as a 
<i>philosopher</i>.<p>

THOMISTS AND SCOTISTS<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In Scotus the opponents of Thomism found a champion. From this time 
forth the Franciscan teachers follow the leadership of Duns Scotus, 
while the Dominicans range themselves behind St. Thomas. The principal 
Scotists were <b>Francis of Mayron</b> (died 1327), surnamed 
<i>Magister Acutus Abstractionum</i>, and <b>Antonio Andrea</b> (died 
1320), surnamed <i>Doctor Dulcifluus</i>. During the fourteenth and 
fifteenth centuries there appeared also the following Scotists: <b>John 
of Basoles, John Dumbleton, Walter Burleigh</b> (<i>Doctor Planus et 
Perspicuus</i>), <b>Alexander of Alessandria, Lychetus of Breach</b>, 
and <b>Nicholas De Orbellis</b>. The best known of the Thomists of this 
period are <b>Gerard of Bologna</b> (died 1317), <b>John of Naples</b> 
(died 1330), <b>Peter De Palude</b> (<i>Pierre de la Palu</i>) (died 
1342), and <b>John Capreolus</b><sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> (1380-1444), who was surnamed 
<i>Princeps Thomistarum</i>. 
 <!--
AVERROISM IN THE SCHOOLS 393  
 --><A NAME="p393"></a><p>

In the course of time the controversy between the rival schools 
absorbed the attention which should have been devoted to the 
development of Scholastic philosophy in relation to the scientific 
doctrines introduced at the opening of the modern era. This, as we 
shall see, is one of the reasons why Scholasticism failed to 
accommodate itself to the scientific movement.<p>

<a name="n_1"><a href="#n1">{1}</a></a> Wadding, in a <i>Life</i> prefixed to the works of Duns Scotus, 
gives Ireland as the birthplace of the Subtle Doctor, and supports his 
contention by several arguments. He quotes the following epitaph (date 
unknown): 
<blockquote>
Scotia me genuit, Anglia me suscepit,<br>
Gallia me docuit, Colonia me tenet.
