NICHOLAS OF AUTRECOURT</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. Nicholas of Autrecourt<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> illustrates by his career as 
well as by his doctrines the deplorable condition into which Ockamism 
and Averroism had plunged philosophical speculation about the middle of 
the fourteenth century. In 1340, while Nicholas was still a mere 
bachelor in theology at the University of Paris, he was cited, together 
with six other students of theology, to appear before Benedict XII to 
answer to the charge of disseminating erroneous doctrines.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Six years 
later he was condemned, and in 1347 he renounced his errors.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Haur&eacute;au and the editors of the <i>Chartularium</i><sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> publish a 
document in which is preserved a sample of the sophistical reasoning 
employed by Nicholas. The only principle which is immediately evident 
is the principle of contradiction. To this principle, therefore, every 
proposition must be reduced, in order that its truth may be 
demonstrated. Now, it is evident that an identical proposition, such as 
A = A, is the only proposition to which the principle of contradiction 
can be applied. It follows that identical propositions are the only 
propositions that can be proved to be true. The law of causality, the 
existence of the external world, the existence of the faculties of the 
soul cannot be demonstrated, because they cannot be reduced to the 
principle of contradiction.<p>

Not content with these conclusions, which are virtually a profession of 
phenomenalism, Nicholas of Autrecourt goes so far as to call into 
question the principle of contradiction itself, thus ending in absolute 
scepticism:<p>

<blockquote>
Deus est, Deus non est, penitus idem significant, licet alio modo. . . 
Item dixi, in quadam disputatione, quod contradictoria ad invicem idem 
significant.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote>

He denies the existence of substantial changes, explaining that such 
changes take place by means of combinations of atoms (<i>congregatio 
corporum athomalium naturalium</i>).<p>

In his theological doctrines Nicholas advocates the theologicat 
determinism (denial of free will on the part of God) which was 
formulated by <b>Thomas Bradwardine</b> in his celebrated treatise 
<i>De Causa Dei contra Pelagium</i> (1344).<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The doctrine of theological determinism 
shows the influence of the ultra-realism of the Averroists, while the 
sophistical method employed by Nicholas of Autrecourt betrays the 
influence of the method, if not of the doctrines, of Ockam. These two 
factors, Averroism and Ockamism, brought about the degeneration of 
Scholasticism even before the dawn of the modern era and the appearance 
of the forces which caused the complete disintegration of the 
Scholastic system.<p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. It is not necessary to point out the signs of decay 
and dissolution which mark the fourth period in the history of 
Scholasticism. The effort to simplify Scholastic philosophy was, no 
doubt, intended as a reform; it aimed at correcting an evil which 
really existed; the process, however, of pruning the superabundant 
growth of philosophy was carried to the extent of cutting out the very 
core of Scholasticism<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> Durandus, Aureolus, and Ockam, by setting aside 
as useless the most essential elements of Scholastic philosophy, did 
more harm to Scholasticism than even the Averroists had done. For it 
was Ockam and his followers who, by neglecting the serious study of the 
great masters of the school, contributed to bring about that profound 
ignorance of the real doctrines of Scholasticism which, at the opening 
of the new era, rendered impossible the alliance of the schoolmen with 
the advocates of the new science. The  
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p417"></a>
 Averroists wrought, irreparable injury to Scholasticism both directly 
and indirectly: directly, by their doctrines of determinism and of the 
unity of the active intellect, as well as by their principle that what 
is true in theology may be false in philosophy; indirectly, by their 
peculiar method, which was known as <i>ipsedixitism</i>. The Averroists 
outdid the Thomists and Scotists in their reverence for the word of the 
master; they gloried in the title of "Aristotle's monkey," or " 
Averroes' monkey," and when the Renaissance came, and the antagonism 
between science and philosophy arose out of the misunderstandings of 
the philosophers and the scientists, the greatest source of 
misunderstanding was the failure of the scientists to distinguish 
between the method of the earlier schoolmen and that of the degenerate 
Scholastics, who had fallen into the ways of the Averroists, and had 
begun to test all truth by an appeal to the authority of a master.<p>

Before we turn to the study of the modern era it is necessary to give 
here a general idea of the character of Scholastic philosophy.<p>

<b>Character of Scholastic Philosophy</b>. Scholastic philosophy had 
its origin, as we have seen, in the foundation of the Carolingian 
schools, an event which was the beginning of an intellectual 
renaissance of Europe in no way inferior in importance to the 
humanistic renaissance of the fifteenth century. The philosophy of the 
schools resulted from the attempt to dispel the intellectual darkness 
of the age of barbarian rule, and throughout the course of its 
development it bore the mark of its origin. The schoolmen were the 
defenders of the rights of reason; and if mysticism retarded, and 
rationalism compromised, the Scholastic movement, the success of 
mysticism and rationalism was merely temporary. Abelard and Gilbert de 
la Porr&eacute;e were succeeded by Alexander of Hales, Albert the 
Great, and St. Thomas of Aquin, who, while they avoided the errors into 
which their predecessors had fallen, adopted the idea of method for 
which 
 <!--
418 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p418"></a>
 their predecessors had contended, and succeeded in winning over even 
the most unyielding of the orthodox to a recognition of the just claims 
of human reason. The attitude of the great schoolmen towards the rights 
of reason appears most strikingly in the Scholastic use of dialectic as 
a means of arriving at a knowledge of natural truth and of obtaining a 
scientific, albeit an imperfect, grasp of the meaning of the mysteries 
of faith.<p>

The use of dialectic by the schoolmen was determined by the conditions 
in which Scholasticism developed. Until the end of the twelfth century 
the schoolmen's knowledge of Greek philosophy was virtually limited to 
an acquaintance with Aristotle's logical treatises. When, however, 
Aristotle's metaphysical and psychological works were introduced into 
Christian Europe, the schoolmen began to construct a system of 
speculation based on Aristotelian metaphysics and psychology. The 
problem of universals, which the preceding centuries had discdssed from 
the dialectician's point of view, was now successfully solved by the 
application of the principles of Aristotle's psychology. The notions of 
substance, person, nature, accident, mode, potency, and act were 
developed by the aid of Aristotle's metaphysical doctrines, and a 
theory of knowledge was formulated from his principles of epistemology. 
Still, the adoption of Aristotelianism as the basis of a system of 
speculative thought, and the application of Aristotelianism to a 
rational exposition of Christian dogma, must not be taken as the 
essential trait of Scholasticism. For Scholastic philosophy was 
eclectic in the truest sense of the word. While preserving a correct 
idea of systematic cohesiveness, it admitted elements of truth from 
whatever source they were derived, whether from Aristotle or from 
Plato, from the Stoics or from the Epicureans, from the writers of the 
Patristic age or from the Greek and Arabian commentators.<p>

The trait which, even more than the use of dialectic or the adoption of 
Aristotelianism, characterized the philosophy of the schools, is the 
effort on the part of the schoolmen to unify 
 <!--
CHARACTER OF SCHOLASTIC PHILOSOPHY 419 
 --><A NAME="p419"></a>
 philosophy and theology, to discover and demonstrate the harmony of 
natural truth with truth of the supernatural order. This is the thought 
which inspired the first speculative attempts of the schoolmen, and 
which, after having manifested itself in so widely different forms in 
the philosophy of Erigena, of Abelard, and of St. Anselm, was finally 
crystallized in the principles in which St. Thomas enunciated his 
definition of the relations between reason and faith. The day has long 
gone by when a historian could, without fear of contradiction and 
protest, represent Scholastic philosophy as the subjugation of reason 
to authority. It is now universally conceded that the phrase <i>ancilla 
theologiae</i> implied no servility on the part of philosophy, but 
rather the honorable service of carrying the torch by which the path of 
theology is lighted. Haur&eacute;au<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> declares that one has but to 
look at the vast number of volumes which the schoolmen wrote to realize 
how much value they attached to philosophy and how inexorably they felt 
the need of exercising their reason. Indeed, it is only the most 
superficial student of history who fails to recognize in the Middle 
Ages a period of immense intellectual activity, and the more the 
philosophy of that period is studied the deeper becomes the conviction 
that the schoolmen were far from failing to recognize the rights of 
human reason. If, then, Scholastic philosophy effected the most perfect 
conciliation of reason with faith, we must not take it for granted that 
the conciliation was brought about at the cost of the independence of 
philosophy. The schoolmen were as far removed from fideism as they were 
from rationalism. They attached independent value to philosophy as well 
as to theology, while they contended that philosophy and theology can 
never contradict each other. In this way -- and herein lies the 
philosophical significance of Scholastic philosophy -- the schoolmen 
established between the natural and the supernatural the relation which 
the Greeks had established between matter and spirit, the relation of 
distinction without opposition. 
 <!--
420 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p420"></a><p>

This doctrine of the continuity and independence of the natural with 
respect to the supernatural order of truth is the core of 
Scholasticism. It is by this that Scholasticism is distinguished from 
Greek philosophy, of which the chief defect, as well as the paramount 
merit, was its complete naturalness. It is by this, too, that 
Scholasticism is distinguished from the philosophy of the new era. 
Modern philosophy -- post-Reformation philosophy, as it may be called  
-- was born of the revolt of philosophy against theology, of reason 
against faith. It adopted at the very outset the Averroistic principle 
that what is true in theology may be false in philosophy, -- a 
principle diametrically opposed to the thought which inspired 
Scholasticism. Indeed, in the first great system which appeared in the 
modern era, not only is philosophy divorced from theology, but mind is 
placed in complete antithesis to matter; for in Descartes' philosophy, 
the spirit of disintegration, which characterizes the modern era, is 
subversive not only of the work of the schoolmen but also of the best 
achievements of Greek speculation. Scholasticism distinguishes without 
separating; modern philosophy either fails altogether to distinguish 
(<i>fideism, monism</i>), or distinguishes and separates 
(<i>rationalism, Cartesian spiritualism</i>).<p>

It remains to point out the difference in character between Scholastic 
philosophy and the philosophy of the Patristic era. The Fathers, as 
well as the schoolmen, taught (as, indeed, all Christian philosophers 
must teach) that revelation cannot contradict reason, nor reason, 
revelation. But, although the Fathers employed reason in order to 
elucidate revelation, they did not carry the use of dialectic to the 
extent to which the schoolmen subsequently carried it: in ultimate 
resort, they insisted on the ascetico-religious rather than on the 
logical quality of mind as a condition requisite for the attainment of 
higher knowledge. Moreover, the Fathers were, with few exceptions, 
Platonists, while the schoolmen were practically all Aristotelians. 
Finally, while the Fathers, in conditions more or less unfavorable to 
 <!--
CHARACTER OF SCHOLASTIC PHILOSOPHY 421 
 --><A NAME="p421"></a>
 constructive effort, effected a partial synthesis of the speculative 
elements of Christian thought, the schoolmen, in a rejuvenated and 
completely Christianized Europe, in an age in which every circumstance 
was favorable to synthetic speculation, completed the synthesis begun 
in the Patristic age, and developed a philosophy which is as different 
from the philosophy of the Patristic era as the Neo-Latin Europe of the 
thirteenth century is from the decadent Latin Europe of the fifth.<p>
