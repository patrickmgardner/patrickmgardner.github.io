<h3 align="center">CHAPTER LIX<br>
FRENCH EMPIRICISM</h3><p>

When, in 1729, Montesquieu and Voltaire returned to France from 
England, and introduced among their fellow-countrymen the ideas 
prevalent among the English deists and empiricists, an impetus was 
given to a French empirical movement which, with characteristic 
disregard for the restraints of convention and positive religion, 
advanced from psychological empiricism to materialism in metaphysics, 
hedonism in ethics, and unbelief and revolt in matters of religious 
conviction. The social, political, and religious conditions of France 
in the eighteenth century contributed to this result. The court of 
Versailles 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p501"></a>
 had become a synonym for frivolity if not for licentiousness, and even 
after due allowance is made for the exaggerations of historians 
prejudiced against the old <i>r&eacute;gime</i>, it must be admitted 
that the grievances of the subjects of the monarchy were many and 
serious. The Church, whose duty it was to inculcate justice and 
forbearance, was identified, in the minds of the people, with the 
monarchy which they feared and detested. Thus it was that the poets, 
philosophers, and essayists of the latter half of the eighteenth 
century found in the popular mind a field ready to receive the seeds of 
the materialism and naturalism which flourished in the days preceding 
the Revolution and bore fruit in the Revolution itself. In England the 
old order gradually yielded to the action of the new forces; in France 
the old order maintained an attitude of unyielding antagonism. In 
England the establishment of new political ideas was in the nature of a 
slow assimilation; in France the destruction of the ancient political 
system assumed the proportions of a cataclysm.<p>

<b>Speculative Sensism</b>. The first to formulate a thoroughgoing 
system of sensism, as a logical development of Locke's empiricism, was 
the Abb&eacute; <b>Condillac</b> (1715-1780) In his <i>Trait&eacute; 
des sensations</i> he reduces all knowledge to experience and all 
experience to sensations. In fact, consciousness with all its contents 
is nothing but transformed sensations (<i>sensations 
transform&eacute;es</i>). To illustrate this, Condillac imagines a 
statue which is first endowed with the sense of smell, and then with 
other senses in succession, the sense of touch being last; for it is by 
means of the sense of resistance that we distinguish between 
<i>self</i> and <i>not-self</i>. Before being endowed with the sense of 
touch the statue refers odor, color, and so forth, to itself; after it 
has acquired the sense of touch, it refers its sensations to the 
external world. <i>Personality</i> is, therefore, the sum of our 
sensations. Condillac teaches that it is by the superiority of the 
sense of touch that man differs from brutes: that every sensation is 
accompanied by pleasure or pain; that desire springs from the  
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 502
 --><A NAME="p502"></a>
 remembrance of pleasant sensations; that the "good" as well as the 
"beautiful" denotes a pleasure-giving quality.<p>

With Condillac is associated <b>Charles Bonnet</b> (1720-1793), who in 
his <i>Essai de psychologie</i> advocates a mitigated form of 
sensationalism.<p>

<b>Ethical Sensism</b>. The ethical deductions from sensistic 
psychology appear in the writings of Helv&eacute;tius (1715-1771), 
author of <i>De l'esprit</i> and <i>De l'homme</i>. Helv&eacute;tius 
teaches that <i>all men are equally endowed by nature</i>, that the 
difference between men arises from education, and that susceptibility 
to pleasure and pain, which declares itself in self-interest, is the 
ultimate element in human character, and the source of all mental and 
moral activity. Education, legislation, and positive religion are 
doomed to failure as long as they refuse to recognize the truth that 
all that is good and noble and virtuous in human conduct is based on 
self-interest.<p>

<b>Sceptics and Materialists</b>. <b>Voltaire</b> (1694-1778), although 
not a professed philosopher, exercised a widespread influence on the 
philosophic thought of his century. His <i>Dictionnaire philosophique 
portatif</i> was written for the purpose of ridding philosophy of 
cumbersome technical terminology and presenting it in popular form. 
This necessitated <i>superficiality</i> of treatment, but, as Erdmann 
says, in Voltaire's superficiality lies his strength. Voltaire was not 
an atheist: not only did he believe that the existence of God is 
proclaimed by all nature, but he was even of opinion that if God did 
not exist we should be under the necessity of inventing a God. He 
defended immortality on the ground of practical necessity, and openly 
declared that materialism is nonsense. It was characteristic of the 
superficiality of the man that the earthquake of Lisbon (1775) should 
change him from an optimist to a pessimist. He attacked Christianity as 
a positive form of religion, waging unwearied war against the 
Scriptures, the Church, and the most sacred beliefs of Christians. In 
this way, by helping to undermine 
 <!--
FRENCH MATERIALISM 503 
 --><A NAME="p503"></a>
 belief in the supernatural, he aided the cause of materialism and 
atheism.<p>

Materialism and atheism were openly taught and defended in the famous 
<i>Encyclopedia (Dictionnaire raisonn&eacute; des arts des sciences et 
des m&eacute;tiers</i>), which was published at Paris between the years 
1751 and 1772. The principal encyclopedists were <b>Diderot, 
d'Alembert, Voltaire, Holbach</b>, and <b>Rousseau</b>. The work was 
sceptical, irreverent, and brilliant with keen wit and caustic satire. 
It was by the charms of its style, rather than by the force of its 
arguments, that it did so much towards sapping the popular belief in 
God, in spirituality, in human liberty, and in the sacredness of the 
traditional ideals of morality.<p>

The physician <b>La Mettrie</b> (1709-1751), author of <i>L'histoire 
naturelle de l'&acirc;me</i> and <i>L'homme machine</i>, was one of the 
most outspoken defenders of materialism. He taught that everything 
spiritual is a delusion, and that physical enjoyment is the highest aim 
of human action. The soul, he maintained, is nothing but a name, unless 
by it we mean the brain, which is the organ of thought; thought is the 
function of the brain; man excels brutes simply because his brain is 
more highly developed; death ends all things, and consequently we 
should enjoy this world and hasten the reign of atheism, for men will 
never be truly happy until theologians will have ceased to trouble and 
Nature will have asserted her claims.<p>

The materialistic monism thus flippantly defended by La Mettrie was 
taught with more pretension to scientific seriousness in the work 
entitled <i>Syst&egrave;me de la nature</i>, which was published 
pseudonymously in 1770, and of which <b>Holbach</b> (1723-1789) is now 
universally admitted to be the author. The work may be said to be the 
bible of the materialists of the end of the eighteenth century.<p>

The last representative of psychological materialism in the eighteenth 
century was the physician <b>Cabanis</b> (1757-1808), who taught that body 
and mind are identical, that the nerves are the 
 <!--

 man, and that thought is a secretion of the brain: "Le cerveau 
dig&egrave;re les impressions . . . il fait organiquement la 
s&eacute;cr&eacute;tion de la pens&eacute;e."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Political Philosophers</b>. It was <i>Montesquieu</i> (1689-1755), 
author of <i>De l'esprit des lois</i>, who first introduced Locke's 
empiricism into France. In his <i>Lettres persanes</i> he had shown 
himself an ardent admirer of the federal form of government, but in the 
work <i>De l'esprit des lois</i>, written after his return from 
England, he holds up the English constitutional monarchy as the ideal 
of political organization. He contends that <i>right is anterior to 
law</i>, advocates the independence of the judicial power with respect 
to the executive and legislative powers, and defends the extension of 
the legislative authority of representative assemblies. He teaches 
that laws should be adapted to the character and spirit of the nation, 
and, following the empirical method, he traces the influence of 
climate, manners, religion, etc., on national character<p>

<b>Jean Jacques Rousseau</b><sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> (1712-1778) was, in one respect, the 
most consistent representative of the movement which we have been 
studying, -- a movement <i>to establish the individualistic point of 
view</i> in religion, philosophy, and politics, -- yet, in another 
respect, he was a most uncompromising antagonist of that movement; for, 
instead of insisting on the advantages of enlightenment and 
civilization he advocated a <i>return to primitive feeling and to the 
state of nature</i>. <i>&Eacute;mile</i>, a philosophical romance, is 
devoted to an account of his ideal of education, and the treatise 
entitled <i>Contrat social</i>, to an exposition of his political 
philosophy. He draws an ideal picture of man, as he originally existed 
in the state of nature, before entering into the <i>social contract</i> 
by which society was first formed, and he teaches that all authority 
resides in the sovereign will of the people. He maintains the right of 
the people to assemble for the purpose of confirming, altering, and 
abrogating all authority  
 <!--
THE IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT 505 
 --><A NAME="p505"></a>
 in the state. Thus he rejects the division of legislative, judicial, 
and executive powers, substituting for them the rule of popular 
assembly. In his religious doctrines he is a deist rather than an 
atheist.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The so-called French enlightenment of the 
eighteenth century is a one-sided development of the empiricism 
inaugurated in England by Locke and introduced into France by 
Montesquieu and Voltaire. If we except Rousseau, the representatives of 
the age of enlightenment were men of meager or at most of mediocre 
intellectual ability, who failed to leave any lasting impression on the 
development of speculative thought. Indeed, Voltaire, who certainly 
knew the age in which he lived, pronounced it to be "an age of 
trivialities." Rousseau alone spoke as one who had seriously studied 
the spirit of his time, when he demanded the abandonment of artificial 
culture and conventional refinement in favor of what is natural, 
simple, and therefore of permanent value in human life. To this cry of 
an age of unrest the French Revolution was the answer.<p>
