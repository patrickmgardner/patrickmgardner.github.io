THE HUMANISTS</h3><p>

The movement known as the Renaissance<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> is commonly said to date from 
the reign of Nicholas V (1447). The principles, however, as well as the 
spirit of the movement, had appeared during the first years of the 
fifteenth century, and were propagated and fostered by the Greek 
scholars who flocked to Italy 
 <!--
426 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p426"></a>
 after the fall of Constantinople (1453). The Renaissance reached its 
Golden Age during the reign of Leo X (1513). It consisted in a revival 
of the study of the Greek and Roman classics, attention being paid to 
the form rather than to the contents of classical literature. The 
representatives of the movement were called "humanists," in allusion to 
their opposition to the Scholastics, who were alleged to have insisted 
on the divine, or supernatural, to the exclusion of the human, or 
natural, elements in their philosophical and theological and above all 
in their literary labors. The Renaissance is of interest primarily and 
essentially to the historian of literature. Secondarily, however, and 
as it were accidentally, it vitally affected the fate of Scholastic 
philosophy and contributed to the transition from mediaeval to modern 
modes of thought. The humanists claimed the privilege of ridiculing and 
attacking the schoolmen, and such was the deplorably degenerate 
condition of Scholasticism at the time that the ridicule was often 
deserved and almost always successful. But, not content with censuring 
what was deserving of censure, the humanists went so far as to condemn 
the entire system of Scholastic philosophy and to include in their 
condemnation the work of the thirteenth century masters, whose 
doctrines they never seriously attempted to understand. While lauding 
the literary excellence of the pagan classics, they lost no opportunity 
of defaming the great representatives of Christian thought; they were 
<i>detractores</i>, as well as <i>laudatores, temporis acti</i>.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In addition to this general opposition of the humanists to the learning 
of the schools, there appeared among the representatives of the 
Renaissance a more direct form of anti-Scholasticism in the shape of a 
revival of the doctrines of the Platonic academy. <b>Gemietus 
Pletho</b>, a Greek scholar who had attended the council of Florence as 
ambassador of the Emperor John VIII, inspired Cosmo de' Medici with the 
idea of founding a Platonic academy  
 <!--
THE HUMANISTS 427 
 --><A NAME="p427"></a>
 at Florence. He was aided in the work of expounding Platonism by 
Cardinal <b>Bessarion</b> (1403-1472), who was also a Greek. Among the 
Italian humanists, <b>Lorenzo Valla</b> (1400-1457), <b>Marsilio 
Ficino</b> (1433-1499), <b>Giovanni Pico della Mirandola</b> (died 
1494), and his nephew, <b>Giovanni Francesco Pico della Mirandola</b> 
(died 1533) distinguished themselves by the violence and acrimony with 
which they attacked the Aristotelians. At the same time <b>Theodore of 
Gaza</b> (died 1478) and <b>George of Trebizond</b> (1396-1484) rose 
into prominence as defenders of the philosophy of Aristotle.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Not only Platonism and Aristotelianism, but also Stoicism and 
Epicureanism, had their representatives among the humanists. <b>Justus 
Lipsius</b> (Joest Lips) (1547-1606) and <b>Caspar Schoppe</b> (born 
1562) revised the doctrines of the Stoa, while <b>Gassendi</b> (1592-
1655) reproduced the essential doctrines of Epicureanism.<p>

<b>Paracelsus</b> (1493-1541) undertook the reform of medical science, 
and developed a system of speculative thought in which chemistry and 
theosophy are mingled in the most fantastic manner. His influence is 
noticeable in the writings of <b>Robert Fludd</b> (died 1637) and in 
those of the two <b>Van Helmonta</b> (died 1644 and 1699).<p>

Scepticism, a natural outcome of the intellectual confusion of the 
times, was represented in France by <b>Montaigne</b> (1533-1592) and 
<b>Pierre Charron</b> (1541-1603), and in Portugal by <b>Francisco 
Sanchez</b> (died 1632).<p>

Far more important than these attempts of some of the humanists to 
restore the Platonism, Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Pyrrhonism of 
ancient times was the controversy waged by the various interpreters of 
Aristotle on the question of the immortality of the soul. Pietro 
Pomponazzi, or <b>Pomponatius</b> (1462-1530), maintained that the 
Alexandrian interpreters understood Aristotle to teach that the human 
soul is mortal, and contended that this was the genuine mind of the 
Stagyrite. <b>Achillini</b>, <b>Nifo</b> (Niphus), and others followed 
the Averroistic interpretation, and 
 <!--
428 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p428"></a>
 contended that the separate, or impersonal, soul alone is immortal, 
the individual soul being immortal according to theology, but mortal 
according to philosophy.<p>

Of great importance, too, was the anti-Aristotelian movement 
inaugurated by <b>Petrus Ramus</b> (Pierre de la Ram&eacute;e, slain in 
the massacre of St. Bartholomew's day, 1572), who opposed the accepted 
Aristotelian system of logic, and, in his treatises <i>Aristotelicae 
Animadversiones</i> and <i>Institutiones Dialecticae</i>, attempted to 
formulate a new system of logical doctrine.<p>

From the ferment of thought occasioned by the mingling all these 
elements there emerged a more or less definite system of naturalism 
known as the <i>Italian Philosophy of Nature</i>.<p>
