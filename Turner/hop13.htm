 <!--
THIRD PERIOD OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY 161  
 --><A NAME="p161"></a>
<h2 align="center">THIRD PERIOD. POST-ARISTOTELIAN PHILOSOPHY</h2><p>

The death of Aristotle marks the end of the Golden Age of Greek 
philosophy. From Thales to Socrates was the period of beginnings; from 
Socrates to Aristotle, the period of highest perfection; with the 
opening of the post-Aristotelian period begins the age of decay and 
dissolution. To this third period belong the <i>pantheism of the 
Stoics</i>, the <i>materialism of the Epicureans</i>, and the final 
relaxation of all earnest philosophical thought, culminating in the 
absolute <i>scepticism of the Pyrrhonists</i>. The period of highest 
perfection in philosophy was also the period of the political 
greatness of Greece, and the causes which brought about the political 
downfall of Greece are in part accountable for the decay of Greek 
philosophy.<p>

Sixteen years before the death of Aristotle, the battle of Chaeronea 
(338 B.C.) was fought, -- the battle in which the doom of Greece was 
sealed. There followed a series of unsuccessful attempts to shake off 
the Macedonian yoke. In vain did Demosthenes strive to arouse in the 
breasts of the Athenians the spirit of the days of Marathon and 
Thermopylae; the iron hand of military despotism crushed the last 
manifestations of patriotism. Then the Roman came, to succeed the 
Macedonian, and Greece, the fair home of philosophy in the West, was 
made a province of a vast military and commercial empire.<p>

The loss of political freedom was followed by a period of torpor of the 
creative energies of the Greek mind.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Speculation, in the highest 
sense of constructive effort, was no longer possible and philosophy 
became <i>wholly practical</i> in its aims. Theoretical knowledge was 
valued not at all, or only in so far as it contributed to that bracing 
and strengthening of the moral fiber 
 <!--
162 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p162"></a>
 which men began to seek in philosophy, and for which alone philosophy 
began to be studied. Philosophy thus came to occupy itself with ethical 
problems, and to be regarded as a refuge from the miseries of life. 
When men ceased to count it an honor to be a citizen of Hellas, they 
turned to philosophy in order to become citizens of the world; and so 
philosophy assumed a <i>more cosmopolitan character</i>. Imported into 
the Roman Empire, it failed at first to take root on Roman soil because 
in the Latin contempt of the <i>Graeculus</i> was included a contempt 
for all things Greek. Gradually, however, philosophy gained ascendency 
over the Roman mind, while in turn the Roman love of the practical 
asserted its influence on Greek philosophy.<p>

All these influences resulted in (1) a disintegration of the 
distinctively Greek spirit of philosophy and the substitution of a 
cosmopolitan spirit of eclecticism; (2) a centering of philosophical 
thought around the problems of human life and human destiny; and (3) 
the final absorption of Greek philosophy in the reconstructive efforts 
of the Greco-Oriental philosophers of Alexandria.<p>

But, while metaphysics and physics were neglected in this 
anthropocentric movement of thought, the mathematical sciences, 
emancipating themselves from philosophy, began to flourish with new 
vigor. The astronomers of Sicily and later those of Alexandria stand 
out of the general gloom of the period as worthy representatives of the 
Greek spirit of scientific inquiry.<p>

The principal schools of this period are: (1) the Stoics, (2) the 
Epicureans, (3) the Sceptics, (4) the Eclectics, (5) the mathematicians 
and astronomers. A separate chapter will be devoted to The Philosophy 
of the Romans.<p>

THE STOICS 163

<hr align="center"><p><a name="Chapter"></a>

<h3 align="center">CHAPTER XIII<br>
THE STOICS</h3><p>

<b>Sources</b>. All the writings of the earlier Stoics, with the 
exception of a few fragments, have been lost. We possess, indeed, the 
complete works of the later Stoics, -- <i>Seneca, Epictetus, Marcus 
Aurelius, Heraclitus</i>, and <i>Cornutus</i>; but these philosophers 
lived under the Roman Empire, at a time when foreign influences had 
substituted new elements for the doctrines which had been 
characteristic of the school at the beginning of its existence. We are 
obliged, therefore, to rely for our knowledge of early Stoicism on 
writers like <i>Cicero, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, Sextus 
Empiricus</i> , and the Aristotelian commentators, who, however, do not 
always distinguish between the earlier and the later forms of Stoicism. 
Consequently, it will be found more satisfactory first to give a 
history of the Stoic school, and then to describe the Stoic doctrine as 
a whole, without attempting to determine the contributions made by 
individual members of the school.<p>

<b>History of the Stoic School</b>. (a) <i>Greek Stoics</i>. <b>Zeno of 
Cittium</b> (350-258 B.C.), the founder of the Stoic school, was born 
at Cittium in Cyprus in the year 350 B.C. He was at first a merchant, 
but owing, it is said, to a shipwreck in which he lost a considerable 
part of his wealth, he repaired to Athens with the intention of 
pursuing the study of philosophy. On reading the <i>Memorabilia</i> of 
Xenophon and the <i>Apology</i> of Plato, he was impressed with the 
remarkable character of Socrates, and was led to attach himself to the 
school of Crates, the Cynic, who appeared to reproduce in his own life 
and manners the character of the sage. Later on, repelled, no doubt, by 
the coarseness and vulgarity of the Cynics, he became successively 
disciple of Stilpo, the Megarian, and of Xenocrates, the ruler of the 
Academy. About the year 310 B.C. he founded a school of his own, which 
reason of his habit of teaching in the Painted Porch (<b>Stoa</b>) came 
to be known as the <i>Stoic</i> school. He reached an advanced age and, 
according to account given by Diogenes and others, ended his life by 
suicide. His writings have all been lost.<p>

<b>Cleanthes</b> succeeded Zeno as master of the Stoa. He is said to 
have been originally a pugilist. Zeno characterized the mental 
temperament of Cleathes by comparing him to a hard slab on which it is 
difficult to write, but which retains indefinitely whatever is written 
on it. True to this description, Cleanthes preserved the teachings of 
his master, but showed himself incapable of expanding them into a more 
complete system. 
 <!--
164 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p164"></a>
 He is the reputed author of a <i>Hymn to the Most High</i>, preserved 
by Stobaeus.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p> 

<b>Chrysippus</b>, who succeeded Cleanthes, was born at Soli, in 
Cilicia, in the year 280 B.C. He was more original than Cleanthes, and 
under his direction the Stoic school reached its full development. 
Among his disciples were <b>Zeno of Tarsus</b>, <b>Diogenes of 
Seleucia</b>, and <b>Antipater of Tarsus</b>, whose pupil, 
<b>Panaetius</b> (180-111 B.C.), introduced Stoicism into the Roman 
world.<p>

(b) <i>Roman Stoics</i>. Among the Roman Stoics the best known are 
<b>L. Annaeus Cornutus</b> (A.D. 20-66), <b>M. Annaeus Lucanus</b> 
(A.D. 39-65), <b>Seneca</b> the younger (A.D. 3-65), <b>Persius</b>, 
the satirist (A.D. 34-62), <b>Epictetus</b>, the philosopher-slave 
(flourished A.D. 90), and the Emperor <b>Marcus Aurelius</b> (A.D.
 121-180).<p>

It is a fact worthy of note that Cleanthes, Seneca, and Lucan committed 
suicide in accordance with what as we shall see was one of the ethical 
doctrines of the school, imitating in this the example of the founder.<p>

STOIC PHILOSOPHY<p>

<b>General Idea of Stoic Philosophy</b>. The Stoics evidently 
considered themselves the true disciples of Socrates, and it was, 
without doubt, from Socratic principles that they deduced their <i>idea 
of the aim and scope of philosophy</i>. We have seen that Zeno was 
first led to philosophy by the hope of finding in it consolation for 
the loss of his temporal goods, and when he came to establish his 
school he took for his starting point the Socratic doctrine that 
knowledge is virtue, making the pursuit of knowledge (philosophy) and 
the cultivation of virtue synonymous. When, however, the Stoics set 
about discovering <i>a systematic basis</i> for their ethical 
teachings, they went back to pre-Socratic systems, and drew largely 
from the physical doctrines of Heraclitus. Now, there were two tenets 
in the Heraclitean philosophy which recommended themselves in a special 
manner to the Stoics: (1) that all individual things are but the
 ever-changing manifestations, or apparitions, of the ever-enduring 
fire, and (2) that there is but one law, which governs the actions of 
men, as well as the 
 <!--
STOIC LOGIC 165 
 --><A NAME="p165"></a>
 processes of nature. Consequently, the Stoics made these principles 
the foundation of the science of human conduct. At the same time they 
did not hesitate to supplement the physics of Heraclitus by borrowing 
from Aristotle's physical doctrines. They were influenced, too, by 
Antisthenes' nominalism and by his opposition to the Platonic theory 
of Ideas, and in their theological doctrines they made use of the 
Socratic and Platonic teleology.  All these elements they amalgamated 
into a consistent system. Logic and physics they made subservient to 
ethics, on the principle that the theoretical should be subordinated 
to the practical.<p>

We have, therefore, three <i>divisions of Stoic Philosophy</i>. (1) 
<i>Logic</i>, including the theory of knowledge; (2) <i>Physics</i>, 
including theology; and (3) <i>Ethics</i>, the hegemonic science.<p>

<b>Stoic Logic</b>. It was probably Zeno who first gave to logic the 
name by which it is now known, though this is by no means certain. The 
logic of the Stoics was simply the <i>Analytic</i> of Aristotle 
supplemented by a more adequate treatment of the <i>hypothetical 
syllogism</i> and by the addition of the problem of the <i>criterion of 
truth</i>. To the latter question they devoted special attention, and, in 
their solution of it, developed the Stoic theory of knowledge.<p>

<i>Theory of knowledge</i>. 1. The Stoics start with the Aristotelian 
principle that all intellectual knowledge arises from sense perception. 
Sense-perception (<b>aisth&ecirc;sis</b>) becomes 
<i>representation</i>, or imagination (<b>phantasia</b>), as soon as it 
rises into consciousness.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> During the process of sense-perception the 
soul remains passive, the object producing its image on the mind, just 
as the seal produces its impression on wax. The process was, therefore, 
called <b>tup&ocirc;sis</b>, although Chrysippus is said to have 
substituted the word <b>heteroi&ocirc;sis</b>, alteration of the 
soul.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> When the object of knowledge is removed from the presence of 
the senses, we retain a memory of it, and a large number of memories 
constitutes <i>experience</i> (<b>empeiria</b>).
 <!--
166 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p166"></a><p>

2. The next step is the <i>formation of concepts</i>. Concepts are 
formed either (a) <i>spontaneously</i>, that is, when, without our 
conscious cooperation, several like representations fuse into universal 
notions (<b>prol&ecirc;pseis</b>, or <b>koinai ennoiai</b>); or (b) 
<i>consciously</i>, that is, by the reflex activity of the mind, which 
detects resemblances and analogies between our representations, and 
combines these into reflex concepts, or knowledge 
(<b>epist&ecirc;m&ecirc;</b>). Neither spontaneous nor reflex concepts 
are, however, innate; spontaneity does not imply innateness.<p>

3. As, therefore, all our knowledge arises from sense-perception, the 
value to be attached to knowledge depends on the value to be attached 
to sense-perception. Consequently, the Stoics decided that 
<i>apprehension</i> (<b>katal&ecirc;psis</b>) <i>is the criterion of 
truth</i>. That is true which is apprehended to be true, and it is 
apprehended to be true when it is represented in the mind with such 
force, clearness, and energy of conviction that the truth of the 
representation cannot be denied.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> The saying attributed to Zeno by 
Cicero<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> that <i>Perception</i> is like the fingers extended, that 
<i>Assent</i> is like the half-closed hand, that <i>Apprehension</i> is 
like the hand fully closed, and that <i>Knowledge</i> (<i>Scientia</i>) 
is like the closed hand firmly grasped by the other hand, would seem to 
attribute to knowledge a superiority over sense-perception. On closer 
examination, however, it is seen that the difference is only a 
difference of degree.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

4. The question, What is the value of concepts? was answered by the 
Stoics in accordance with nominalistic principles borrowed from 
Antisthenes, who, in opposition to Plato, taught that no universality 
exists outside the mind, the individual alone being real.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

5. In their classification of concepts the Stoics reduced the ten 
Aristotelian categories to four: (1) <i>substance</i> 
(<b>hupokeimenon</b>), (2) <i>essential quality</i> (<b>to poion</b>), 
(3) <i>accidental quality</i> (<b>p&ocirc;s echon</b>), 
 <!--
STOIC PHYSICS AND THEOLOGY 167
 --><A NAME="p167"></a>
 and (4) <i>relation</i> (<b>pros ti p&ocirc; s echon</b>).<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> This 
enumeration, as will be readily perceived, does not retain the 
Aristotelian distinction between predicables and categories. All the 
Stoic categories, except the first, are modes of predication rather 
than modes of being.<p>

<b>Stoic Physics and Theology</b>. The physics of the Stoa is a system 
of materialistic monism, while the theology of the Stoa may be 
described as a compromise between theism and pantheism.<p>

The Stoics maintained that <i>the material alone is real</i>. They 
would not admit, for example, that the soul, or virtue, is real except 
in so far as it is material. God Himself they believed to be material. 
Above all the categories, therefore, they would place not <b>on</b>, 
<i>Being</i>, but <b>ti</b>, <i>something</i>, a transcendental notion 
including not-Being as well as Being, the incorporeal as well as the 
corporeal. Thus did they identify the incorporeal with the unreal, and 
include all real being under the generic concept of matter.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Consistently with these principles the Stoics teach that all attributes 
are air currents: emotions, concepts, judgments, virtues, and vices are 
air currents which either pass into the soul or come out from it.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> In 
extenuation of this crude materialism, it must be remarked that the 
Stoics distinguish between a finer and a coarser matter, attributing to 
the former an active and to the latter a passive character. The air 
currents are in substance material; in function, however, they are 
active, and may be said to play a r&ocirc;le similar to that which the 
form plays in Aristotelian philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
168 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p168"></a><p>

Everything, therefore, is material: the common distinction between 
corporeal and incorporeal is merely a distinction between coarser and 
finer matter. We may, indeed, distinguish two principles, or sources, 
of reality, -- matter and force, -- but we shall find that in 
ultimate analysis force, too, is material.<p>

<i>God</i> is, at once, the Author of the universe and its Soul, -- the 
<i>immanent principle</i> of its life; for every kind of action ultimately 
proceeds from one source, which, whether it resides in the heavens or 
in the sun or in the center of the world (on this point the Stoics were 
not agreed), diffuses itself throughout every part of the universe, as 
the cause of heat and growth and life and motion.<p>

God is at one time described as <i>Fire, Ether, Air, Atmospheric 
Current</i> (<b>pneuma</b>); at another time as <i>Soul, Mind,
 Reason-containing-the-germs-of-all-things</i> (<b>logos 
spermatikos</b>); while sometimes both styles of phraseology are 
combined, and He is called the <i>Fiery Reason of the World, Mind in 
Matter, Reasonable <b>Pneuma</b></i>. The language of compromise is 
never wholly consistent, and the Stoic theology is an attempt to 
<i>compromise between theism and pantheism</i>. It is, however, certain 
that the Stoics conceived God to be something material; for in their 
explanation of the presence of God in the universe they assume that the 
universal intermingling (<b>krasis di hol&ocirc;n</b>) implies the 
impenetrability of matter, so that even when they call Him Mind, Law, 
Providence, Destiny, they understand by these terms something 
corporeal.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

God and the world are the same reality, although there exists a 
relative difference between God, or reality regarded as a whole, and 
the world, or reality considered in some one or other of its aspects. 
This <i>pantheism</i> is the central doctrine of the Stoic physics; 
indeed, it may be said to be the inspiring thought which justified to 
the Stoic mind the study of natural phenomena. For the Stoics, as has 
been said, looked upon philosophy  
 <!--
STOIC THEOLOGY 169 
 --><A NAME="p169"></a>
 as primarily a matter of practical import, and studied physics only in 
order to find a basis for their ethical speculations. Such a basis they 
found in the doctrine of pantheism. This doctrine may, therefore, be 
said to have been their religion as well as their philosophy. 
Accordingly, they criticised the popular beliefs of their time, being 
careful, however, to admit whatever elements of truth they found in 
polytheistic religion, and making free use of allegory as a means of 
bridging over the chasm between polytheism and pantheism.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup><p>

We may, therefore, speak of the world as the <i>body</i>, and of the 
Deity as the <i>soul</i> of the universe, if we are careful to bear in 
mind that the distinction is merely a relative one. The <i>world 
arose</i> in the following manner. The primal fire was condensed into 
air and water; water in turn was condensed into earth The derived 
elements are constantly tending to return by rarefaction to the primal 
fire;<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> but no sooner will this destruction by conflagration have 
taken place than the primal fire will issue forth in another series of 
condensations, thus beginning another cosmic period, which will end 
like its predecessor in conflagration. Here the influence of Heraclitus 
is apparent.<p>

The Deity, regarded as the origin of these processes of condensation 
and returning rarefaction, -- the primal fire, -- is <b>logos 
spermatikos</b> regarded as the ruling or guiding principle of these 
processes, He is <i>Providence</i> (<b>pronoia</b>) and <i>Destiny</i> 
(<b>eimarmen&ecirc;</b>). For all things come forth from the primal 
fire according to law, and all the subsequent changes in the world, all 
the events of human history, take place according to the necessary 
sequence of cause and effect. When we think of the order and 
intelligent arrangement of the divine government, we name the Divine 
Ruler <i>Providence</i>; when we think of the necessary dependence of 
effect on cause, we name Him <i>Destiny</i> or <i>Fate</i>.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> 
According to the Stoic conception, Providence is 
 <!--
170 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p170"></a>
 directed immediately to the processes of the universe in general and 
only mediately to the individual and his actions.<p>

In support of their doctrine of Providence, the Stoics appeal to the 
<i>universal consent of mankind</i>,<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> being, apparently, the first to 
use this argument.<p>

<i>The human soul is material</i>. This not only follows from the 
general principles of Stoic philosophy but is also expressly taught by 
the Stoics and proved with the aid of many arguments.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> The soul is 
conceived as fiery breath (<b>pneuma</b>) diffused throughout the body; 
in fact, the relation of the soul to the body is the same as that of 
the Deity to the world. It is, in a special sense, part of the Deity, 
partaking more and more of the nature of the Deity according as we 
allow greater play to the divine, or reasonable, in us.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> Now, it is 
precisely on account of this special proximity of the soul to the 
divine that it cannot escape the <i>necessity which divine law 
imposes</i> on all things. The soul is in no sense free, unless it be 
said to be free because the necessity by which it is ruled comes from 
its own nature rather than from anything external to it. Merit and 
reward follow the action which, although it <i>must</i> be performed, is 
performed voluntarily, that is, with perfect acquiescence in the rule 
of divine destiny. "Volentem fata ducunt; nolentem trahunt."<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The Stoic idea of the soul is as incompatible with <i>immortality</i> 
as it is with the freedom of the will. The soul, being material, is 
destined to destruction. The time, however, at which the soul is to be 
dissolved into the primal fire is not the moment of death, but the end 
of the cosmic period, when all matter is to be destroyed by 
conflagration. The Stoics were divided as to whether the souls of all 
men, or only those of the wise, will last until that time.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> Seneca's 
reference<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> to death as the birth of a future life, and his 
description of the peace that awaits the 
 <!--
STOIC ETHICS 171 
 --><A NAME="p171"></a>
 soul beyond the grave, suggestive as they are of Platonic and, 
possibly, Christian influences, contain nothing that is at variance 
with what the Stoics taught about the destiny of the human soul.<p>

<b>Stoic Ethics</b>. The Stoics regarded ethics as the "divine part" of 
philosophy, from which, as from a center, all their logical and 
physical inquiries radiate. Questions of logic and physics were of 
interest merely in so far as their solution threw light on the 
paramount problem of philosophy, the problem of human destiny and human 
happiness. Thus, at the very outset of the ethical inquiry concerning 
happiness, the Stoics applied the most characteristic of their physical 
doctrines, -- that everything in the world of reality obeys and must 
obey inevitable law. Man, it is true, is endowed with reason, and is 
thereby enabled to know the law which he obeys; he is none the less 
obliged to obey it. Nay, more, since he is in a special sense divine, 
he is under greater necessity to obey than other manifestations of the 
Divine. The supreme canon of conduct is, therefore, to live conformably 
to nature (<b>homologoumen&ocirc;s t&ecirc; phusei z&ecirc;n</b>), or, 
as Zeno is said to have formulated the maxim, to live a consistent 
life, <b>homologoumenos z&ecirc;n</b>. This is man's happiness 
(<b>eudaimonia</b>), his chief good (<b>agathon</b>), the end of his 
existence (<b>telos</b>).<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The highest purpose of human life is not, therefore, contemplation, but 
action in accordance with the laws of universal nature, with the will 
of the Deity. A hint of this purpose is contained in the instinct of 
self-preservation which is the primary impulse in every being.<p>

Action in accordance with nature's laws is virtue, which Cicero 
translates <i>recta ratio</i>. Virtue is not merely <i>a</i> good; it 
is <i>the only good</i>. Consequently, riches and pleasure and health 
and honors are not goods in any true sense of the word; and the Stoics 
persistently combated the teaching of Plato and Aristotle, who 
considered that the external goods of life are worthy of 
 <!--
172 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p172"></a>
 being desired, although they are subservient to the chief good, which 
is virtue. Stoicism was still more decided in its opposition to the 
Hedonist doctrine which made virtue itself to be a good subordinate to 
pleasure.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Tf, then, virtue is the only good, it <i>must be sought for its own 
sake</i>; it contains all the conditions of happiness; virtue is 
virtue's own reward.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> Everything else is indifferent 
(<b>adiaphoron</b>).<p>

The Stoics adhered to the Socratic doctrine that virtue is one, and 
yet, since virtue, while one, may have a plurality of objects, they 
considered that there are different manifestations of virtue, such as 
prudence, courage, temperance, and justice (which Plato regarded as 
four kinds of virtue), and patience, magnanimity, etc., which may be 
regarded as derivations from one or other of the cardinal virtues.<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> 
Accordingly, a man who is prudent must of necessity be courageous; for 
<i>he who possesses one virtue must possess all</i>.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> Now, he who has 
a right appreciation of good and evil, and who consequently intends to 
do good, is virtuous. From which it follows that no act is in itself 
praiseworthy or reprehensible; the morality of the act is determined by 
the disposition: "Non quid fiat, aut quid detur refert, sed qua 
mente."<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Vice</i>, the opposite of virtue, consists in living out of harmony 
with the laws of nature. Like virtue, it is essentially one. He who is 
guilty of one vice is guilty of all; there is no distinction of degree 
in vice. ("Omnia peccata paria.")<p>

The Stoics, however, although they seemed to identify moral excellence 
with intellectual or rational insight, and spoke of the virtuous man as 
the wise man, recognized that man is not wholly rational. From his 
irrational nature spring the <i>emotions</i> (<b>path&ecirc;</b>). The 
emotions -- <i>perturbationes</i>, as Cicero calls them -- are movements 
of the mind contrary to reason.<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> Now, there is 
 <!--
STOIC ETHICS 173 
 --><A NAME="p173"></a>
 a desire (<b>horm&ecirc;</b>) which is according to law and reason, 
and this is the natural impulse towards what is good. The desire, on 
the contrary, which is according to emotion is intrinsically 
unreasonable and therefore bad; for all emotions are contrary to 
reason. It follows that the wise man should aim at eradicating all his 
emotions; he should strive to become absolutely emotionless.<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup> This 
doctrine of <i>apathy</i> is one of the most characteristic of the 
doctrines of the Stoa.<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In their application of these ethical principles the Stoics developed a 
vast number of <i>paradoxes referring to the wise man</i>, that is, to 
the ideal Stoic philosopher. He alone is free, beautiful, rich, and 
happy. He alone knows how to govern as well as to obey. He is the 
orator, the poet, the prophet. The rest of the world is mad; the 
majority of men pass their lives in wickedness, slaves to custom, to 
pleasure, and to a multitude of desires. The wise man alone is 
indifferent to pain; for him death has no terrors, and when he is 
called upon to decide between death and dishonor he is true to his 
Stoic teaching if he prefers the former. Suicide, therefore, is 
sometimes a duty; it is always justified if impending misfortune is 
such as seriously to threaten peace of mind and tranquillity of soul. 
The wise man is independent of all ties of blood and kinship. He is at 
home everywhere. He is a citizen of the world, or, as Epictetus 
says,<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> he is a child of God and all men are his brethren.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Stoic philosophy, by reason of its 
systematic development, approaches more closely to the 
comprehensiveness of the Platonic and Aristotelian systems than does 
any other philosophy of this third period. Taking up the best 
principles of the Cynic morality, it advanced far beyond the Cynic 
philosophy, owing to the larger part which it assigned  
 <!--
174 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p174"></a>
 to mental culture in its scheme of life, and also to the broader and 
more systematic basis of logic and physics on which it built its 
ethical teaching. Nevertheless, Stoicism is not free from the dominant 
vice of the age to which it belonged. It is a <i>one-sided development 
of philosophy</i>. It subordinates the theoretical to the practical. In 
its theory of knowledge it is sensistic; in its physics it is 
materialistic and pantheistic; in the development of its moral 
principles it subordinates the individual to universal law, stamping 
out individual desire, and advocating the merging of domestic and 
political instincts in a far-off dream of the fellowship of 
cosmopolitan philosophers. It lacks that comprehensive sweep of 
contemplation which, in the golden age of Greek philosophy, set the 
theoretical by the side of the practical, placed the study of nature on 
a footing which gave it a value of its own, distinguished, without 
separating, matter and mind, and in ethics gave due importance to the 
individual emotions and to the social instincts as well as to the 
immutable moral law. This disintegration of the universal philosophical 
view, and the consequent isolation of separate aspects of speculative 
and practical problems, which is first seen in Stoicism, goes on 
increasing in the systems which come after the philosophy of the Stoa.<p>

Of all the defects of Stoicism, that which contributed most to the 
downfall and dissolution of the school was the doctrine that <i>the wise 
man is emancipated from all moral law</i>. This doctrine is not the only 
tenet of the Stoics which recalls the philosophy of the Orient rather 
than that of Greece. The identity of God and the world, the emanation 
of the soul, the final reabsorption of all things in God, -- these 
and similar doctrines are peculiar to the Oriental form of speculation. 
We must remember that Zeno of Cyprus was not more than half Greek, and 
although his mental training and the logical derivation of his 
philosophy were entirely Greek, there was in him enough of the Oriental 
temperament to infuse into his philosophy a spirit more in accordance 
with the quietism of the East than with the Grecian 
 <!--
THE EPICUREANS 175 
 --><A NAME="p175"></a>
 sense of artistic completeness. This quietism, together with the 
exorbitant claims set up on behalf of the wise man, finally brought 
Stoicism down to so low a level of moral aims that it was scarcely to 
be distinguished from Epicureanism.<p>
