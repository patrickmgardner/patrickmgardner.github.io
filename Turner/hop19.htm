GRECO-ORIENTAL PHILOSOPHY</h2><p>

<b>The Alexandrian Movement</b>. The scientific movement in Alexandria, 
of which mention has already been made, was but a phase of the general 
intellectual revival which was centered in the capital of Egypt during 
the last centuries of the old era and the first century of the new. 
This revival may be said to date from the foundation of the city (332 
B.C.) by Alexander the Great, who, owing probably to the influence of 
Aristotle, always held philosophy in the highest esteem and took a 
lively interest in the spread of philosophical knowledge. After the 
division of the Macedonian empire, consequent on the death of 
Alexander, the Seleucidae in Syria, the Attali in Pergamus, and the 
Ptolemies in Egypt continued to protect and encourage philosophy. The 
Ptolemies were especially zealous in the cause of learning, and under 
their rule Alexandria soon became the Athens of the East, -- the center 
of the intellectual as well as of the commercial life of the Orient, -- 
and the point where the Eastern and the Western civilizations met. The 
famous museum, founded about the beginning of the third century before 
Christ by Ptolemy Soter, was literally a home of learning, and the no 
less famous library contained all that was best in Grecian, Roman, 
Jewish, Persian, Babylonian, Phoenician, and Hindu literature. The 
protection and encouragement extended to learning by the Ptolemies were 
continued by the Roman emperors after Egypt became a Roman province.<p>

From this intellectual movement there arose a new phase of 
philosophical thought, which may be broadly characterized as an 
 <!--
THE ALEXANDRIAN MOVEMENT 199
 --><A NAME="p199"></a>
 attempt to unite in one speculative system the philosophy of Greece 
and the religious doctrines of the Orient, -- an attempt which was 
rendered particularly opportune by a variety of circumstances. The Jews 
had settled in large numbers in Alexandria, and there was constant 
communication between Alexandria and Palestine, which was at that time 
dependent on Egypt. The translation known as the <i>Septuagint</i> had 
brought the sacred books of the Hebrews within the reach of Greek 
scholars; and Greek philosophy was not unprepared for the task of 
adjusting itself to the new ideas thus presented to the Greek mind. 
Indeed, Greek philosophy had reached the point where, its own resources 
having been exhausted, it welcomed the inflow of new ideas from the 
East, which had ever been to the Greek imagination the home of the 
mysterious and the spiritual. Besides, the conviction was gaining 
ground that Greek philosophy and Oriental religion had a common origin; 
what, therefore, could seem more natural than that the two should be 
reunited? Finally, the movement had a practical as well as a 
theoretical aim: it was hoped that the diffusion of new religious ideas 
would bring about a reform of the popular religion. At the end of a 
generation of scepticism such a reform was sadly needed.<p>

In the movement thus broadly characterized as an effort to reform the 
intellectual and moral life of the time by a synthesis of Greek 
philosophy and Oriental religion, the religious element was naturally 
the dominant element, and the philosophy which resulted was more 
properly a theosophy than a system of philosophy strictly so called. In 
the stream of theosophical thought we may distinguish two currents: (1) 
<i>Greco-Jewish philosophy</i>; (2) <i>Neo-Pythagoreanism</i> and 
<i>Neo-Platonism</i>. In Greco-Jewish speculation Greek philosophy 
turned to the religious tradition of the East; in the Neo-Pythagorean 
and Neo-Platonic systems it turned rather towards a mystic 
enlightenment, a revelation of the Deity to the individual soul.

GRECO-JEWISH PHILOSOPHY</h3><p>

Greco-Jewish philosophy may be described as an effort to harmonize the 
sacred books of the Hebrews with the tenets of Greek philosophy. The 
Jews of Alexandria were steadfast in the belief that their sacred books 
contained wisdom infinitely superior to the wisdom of philosophers, yet 
they could neither resist the inroad of Greek culture and Greek 
philosophy nor refrain from admiring the wisdom of the Greeks. They set 
themselves, therefore, the task of finding Plato in the law and of 
finding the law in Plato, being guided in the accomplishment of this 
purpose by some such principles as the following:<p>

1. Revelation is the highest possible philosophy: it includes what is 
best in Greek philosophy.<p>

2. The Greeks derived their doctrines ultimately from the Jewish 
Scriptures, or at least from Jewish tradition.<p>

3. "The difference between the revealed doctrines of the Jews and the 
philosophy of the Greeks consists chiefly in this, that in the sacred 
books of the Jews truth is expressed in symbols and figures, whereas 
Greek philosophy puts the figure aside and sets before us the thought 
which the figure expressed."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The practical conclusion of all this was the adoption by the 
Alexandrian Jews of the <i>allegorical method of interpretation</i>.<p>

<b>Aristobulus</b> (about 160 B.C.) was the first to apply these 
exegetical principles in a treatise of which some fragments are 
preserved by Eusebius.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> The first to build on them a system of 
thought was Philo of Alexandria. 
 <!--
PHILO 201  
 --><A NAME="p201"></a><p>

PHILO<p>

<b>Life</b>. Philo was an Alexandrian Jew. Little is known of his life 
beyond the fact that in A.D. 40 he was sent to Rome to represent his 
co-religionists in their contest with Apion.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Philo's works, composed in Greek, are very voluminous.  
Besides these writings we have as sources of information the references 
which Eusebius, and other writers of the early Church make to the 
teachings of Philo.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>General Aim of Philo's Philosophy</b>. It was Philo's aim so to 
expound the Scriptures as to bring the revealed religion of the Old 
Testament into agreement with the philosophy of the Greeks and 
especially with Platonism, Aristotelianism, and Stoicism; for to each 
of these systems he had recourse according as each in turn seemed best 
suited to the text under consideration. On account of this mixture of 
different elements it is impossible to find harmony or unity in his 
philosophical doctrines.<p>

God, the first cause, is the starting point of Philo's system. He is 
above all created things. From His works we know that He exists, but 
what He is is above our comprehension; He transcends all predicates, 
except the predicate of Being, <b>ho on</b>, which He applied to 
Himself: "I am who am." Nevertheless, since men will speak of God after 
their own fashion, He is called One, Unbegotten, Unchangeable, Free, 
Independent of all things.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>The World</b>. The Stoics taught that the world is God: Philo 
teaches that it is the work of God. It is not eternal; it was made, in 
time, by God, who wished, by creating, to manifest His goodness. God, 
being supremely immaterial, did not create the world by His own 
immediate action; He had recourse to the intermediate agency of certain 
<i>powers</i> (<b>dunameis</b>), which are described at one time as 
Divine Ideas and at another as agents, 
 <!--
202 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p202"></a>
 souls, angels, and demons. All these powers are comprehended in the 
Divine Logos.<p>

<b>The Logos</b>. This is one of the peculiar tenets of Philo's 
philosophy. Philo might have taken the Platonic term <i>Idea</i> to 
designate the Logos, for his notion of the Logos is more akin to the 
Platonic world of Ideas than to any other notion in Greek philosophy. 
He chose the word <i>Logos</i>, however, because of the biblical use of 
the term in the expression "Word of God," and because of the Stoic use 
of it in the phrase <b>logos spermatikos</b>. Indeed, the Logos in 
Philo's philosophy corresponds to the Stoic concept of a world-soul as 
well as to the Platonic world of Ideas; for just as in man there are 
the <i>extrinsic word</i> and the <i>indwelling reason</i>, so in the 
Divine Logos we may consider the <b>logos endiathetos</b>, or aggregate 
of Ideas in the divine mind, which is divine wisdom, and the <b>logos 
prophorikos</b>, or world-soul, which is divine power pervading all 
things and giving life to all.<p>

The Logos, then, is the first begotten of God, the Son of God, <i>a</i> 
God, but not God Himself. <i>Its principal function is that of 
mediation</i>: like the high priest, it stands between the Creator and 
the creature. Philo, however, fails to determine in any definite manner 
what the Logos is <i>in itself</i>: the obscurity, the vacillation, the 
apparent contradiction of the expressions which he employs, show how 
vague is his concept of the nature of the Logos, although he has a 
definite concept of its function.<p>

<b>Anthropology</b>. In his doctrine concerning man Philo distinguishes 
the ideal man, made to the image and likeness of God, and the man of 
our own experience, in whom he makes a further distinction of rational 
and irrational natures. At times he elaborates this distinction still 
further, teaching that there are eight different natures in man. In 
speaking of the rational soul, he renews the Pythagorean doctrine of 
transmigration, the Stoic doctrine of the kinship of the soul to God, 
and the Platonic doctrine of the soul's preexistence. The soul of man 
does not differ from the angelic nature, In punishment for some 
original  
 <!--
PHILO'S PSYCHOLOGY AND ETHICS 203  
 --><A NAME="p203"></a>
 sin it was degraded to a union with the body, which is its prison, its 
grave, the source of all its ills and all its misery.<p>

<b>Theory of Knowledge</b>. Philo distinguishes three faculties of 
Cognition <b>aisth&ecirc;sis</b>, which has for its object the concrete 
and sensible; <b>logos</b>, which is the reasoning faculty; and 
<b>Nous</b>, which is the faculty of immediate contemplation of 
intellectual truths. Contemplation, then, is the highest kind of 
knowledge; by it only can man attain absolute certainty. It is not, 
however, like reason and sense, dependent on the natural powers of the 
mind; its light is a light from above, an illumination which God alone 
can give, and which He gives through the Logos to those who pray for 
it. This doctrine of <i>mystical illumination</i> leads to the ethical 
doctrine of mystical ecstasy.<p>

<b>Ethics</b>. The body is constantly inclining the soul towards sin. 
Man's first duty is, therefore, to free his soul from the trammels of 
the body, to rise above the world of sense, to acquire the 
<i>apathy</i> which the Stoics inculcated. His next duty is to rise 
from reason to contemplation, until the soul at last becomes one with 
the Divine Wisdom, and man and God become united in <i>mystical 
ecstasy</i>. In this ecstatic union consists the supreme happiness of 
man. Philo, true to his Oriental instinct, places contemplation above 
action; above the cardinal virtues, which belong to the active life, he 
places confidence in God, piety, penance, and contemplative wisdom. The 
possessor of this wisdom, the truly wise, is truly free: wisdom rescues 
him from the dominion of matter.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Despite the inconsistency of many of his 
doctrines, Philo exercised a considerable influence not merely on the 
Gnostics of the first centuries of the Church but also on the Jewish 
opponents of Scholasticism during the Middle Ages. The most 
characteristic qualities of his philosophy are its spirit of mysticism, 
its ethical quietism, and its psychological and ethical dualism --  
the separation of body and soul, the sources of evil and of good in 
man.<p>
