<b>Division</b>. The period extending from the middle of the fifteenth 
century to the beginning of the seventeenth was one of intellectual 
ferment in which the philosophy of the schools gradually disappeared 
and modern philosophy came to be more and more definitely 
distinguishable. During the first half of the seventeenth century, 
Descartes expounded and defended the first great system of the new 
philosophy, a system which dominated the whole course of thought during 
that century and served as a starting point for the principal systems 
of the following century. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, 
however, an age of criticism was inaugurated in opposition to the 
dogmatism and empiricism of the Cartesian philosophy and its 
derivatives; so that at the opening of the nineteenth century we find a 
new era, in which the predominating influence is that of Kant. We have, 
therefore, the following division of modern philosophy:<p>

FIRST PERIOD -- TRANSITION FROM SCHOLASTIC TO MODERN PHILOSOPHY
 (1450-1600).<p> 
                                         
SECOND PERIOD -- FROM DESCARTES TO KANT
 (1600-1800).<p>

THIRD PERIOD -- FROM KANT TO OUR OWN TIME
 (1800-1900).

<h2 align="center">FIRST PERIOD -- TRANSITION FROM SCHOLASTIC TO MODERN 
PHILOSOPHY</h2><p> 

The change from Scholastic to modern philosophy was gradual, and, while 
its course is not easy to follow, the causes which led to the change 
are not far to seek. First among these must be mentioned the decay of 
Scholasticism itself. The representatives of Scholastic philosophy in 
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries seem for the most part to have 
completely forgotten the principles of the classic Scholasticism of the 
thirteenth century. Busying themselves with subtleties too refined to 
be grasped even by the learned, they utterly neglected the study of the 
scientific movement of their own day, and, in defiance of the method 
sanctioned by usage in the schools of the Golden Age of Scholasticism, 
raised the argument from authority to a position of undue importance. 
There were, however, as we shall see, some notable exceptions to this.<p>

The decay of philosophical speculation in the schools and universities 
of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the humanistic movement, the 
rapid progress of the natural sciences, and the influence of the first 
reformers contributed to bring about the transition from Scholastic to 
modern philosophy. Mention must also be made of the political condition 
of the times, the disintegration of the idea of a united Christian 
empire, the growth of the idea of the political individuality of 
nations, the discovery of America, the invention of the art of 
printing, all of which necessitated a development and adaptation of 
speculative thought to the changed conditions of the time. That 
Scholastic philosophy was capable of such development and adaptation 
must be admitted by all who recognize that thought is continuous in its 
historical evolution; and if such development and adaptation did not 
take place, the fault lay with those who failed to put Scholasticism in 
its true light at this the most critical period in its history.

SCHOLASTICS OF THE TRANSITION PERIOD</h3><p>

The exigencies of religious controversy arising out of the doctrines of 
the reformers brought about a revival of theological activity in the 
Catholic schools and universities of this period. The development of 
theological speculation naturally inspired the effort to restore and 
supplement the philosophy of the Scholastics of the thirteenth century. 
When, therefore, the charge of frivolity and master-worship is made 
against the Scholastics of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, 
exception must be made in favor of those schoolmen who went back to the 
sources of genuine Scholasticism and commented on the works of St. 
Thomas and Scotus.<p>

Chief among the commentators of St. Thomas are <b>Paulus Barbus 
Soncinas</b> (died 1494), who followed in the footsteps, of Capreolus, 
Thomas de Vio Cajetanus (<b>Cajetan</b>, 1469-1534), who wrote what is 
still considered the classic commentary on the <i>Summa Theologica</i> 
of St. Thomas, and Francis a Sylvestris of Ferrara 
(<b>Ferrariensis</b>) (1474-1528), who composed a masterly commentary 
on the <i>Summa contra Gentiles</i>. Mention must likewise be made of 
the theologians <b>Melchior Cano</b> (1509-1560), <b>Dominicus de 
Soto</b> (1494-1560), <b>Dominicus Ba&ntilde;ez</b> (1528-1604), who 
commented on the <i>Summa Theologica</i>, and of John of St. Thomas 
(1589-1644), who wrote a <i>Cursus philosophicus ad exactam, veram et 
genuinam Aristotelis et Doctoris Angelici mentem</i>. Under the 
influence of these Dominicans and that of the great Carmelite teachers, 
new zest was given to the study of St. Thomas at Salamanca and 
Alcal&aacute;, while at the same time a new form of Thomism was 
developed by the Jesuit teachers at Coimbra and at other centers of 
learning in the Iberian peninsula. With this Neo-Thomism is associated 
the establishment of a school of Jesuit theology at the Roman college. 
It was 
 <!--
THE HUMANISTS 425 
 --><A NAME="p425"></a>
 there that <b>Vasquez</b> (1551-1604) and <b>Toletus</b> (1532-1596) 
taught, who influenced to a great extent the subsequent development of 
Catholic theology. Among the Jesuits who taught at Coimbra the best 
known is <b>Fonseca</b> (1528-1599). <b>Suarez</b> (1548-1617), the 
ablest and most distinguished of the Jesuit theologians and 
philosophers of this time, is associated with the intellectual prestige 
of Salamanca, Coimbra, Alcal&aacute;, and Rome. His works, which 
include twenty-three folio volumes, contain, besides commentaries on 
the works of St. Thomas, treatises which, like the <i>Disputationes 
Metaphysicae</i>, are important as independent contributions to the 
literature of Scholastic philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The principal representatives of the philosophy of Scotus are <b>John 
the Englishman</b> (died 1483), <b>Johannes Magistri</b> (died 1482), 
<b>Antonius Trombetta</b> (died 1518), and <b>Maurice the Irishman</b> 
(1463-1513).<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The philosophical significance of these teachers consists in the 
serious effort which they made to understand and expound the works of 
their predecessors, the great masters of Scholastic philosophy.<p>
