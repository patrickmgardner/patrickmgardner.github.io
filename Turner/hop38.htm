ST. THOMAS OF AQUIN<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. St. Thomas, surnamed the Angelic Doctor, belonged to the 
noble family of Aquino, which was related to the imperial family and to 
the royal houses of Aragon, Sicily, and France. His father was count of  
 <!--
344 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
 --><A NAME="p344"></a>
 Aquino, Belcastro, and Roccasecca. In the fortress at Roccasecca our 
saint was born in the year 1224 or 1225.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> When five years old he was 
sent to the monastery of Monte Cassino, where his uncle Sinnebald ruled 
as abbot. There, in the midst of the struggles between the papacy and 
the empire, -- struggles in which the abbot, as feudal lord of a large 
province, was obliged to take sides, -- the monks continued to teach 
and to cultivate learning, and there, according to tradition, the young 
Thomas began to occupy his mind with the question, <i>Quid est 
Deus?</i> He studied grammar, poetry, rhetoric, logic, and, perhaps, 
the elements of philosophy. In 1236 Sinnebald died, and shortly after 
that event the community of Monte Cassino was broken up for a time, and 
St. Thomas returned to his father's castle. After a brief sojourn at 
home St. Thomas was sent to the University of Naples. The change from 
Monte Cassino to the university was an important crisis in the life of 
our saint. The university was at that time dominated by the influence 
of Frederick II, an influence which was hostile to religion, or at 
least to the papacy and to the mendicant orders. The city, if we are to 
believe contemporary chroniclers, was a veritable hotbed of irreligion 
and licentiousness. St. Thomas, uninfluenced by these surroundings, 
continued to devote himself to his studies, having for masters Martinus 
in grammar and Petrus Hibernus in natural science: "In quorum scholis," 
says Tocco, "tam luculenti coepit esse ingenii et perspicacis 
intelligentiae ut altius et profundius et darius aliis audita repeteret 
quam a suis doctoribus audivisset."<p>

In 1243 Thomas entered the order of St. Dominic. His mother, Theadora, 
having looked forward to another career for her son, threw every 
obstacle in the way of his entering the Order of Preachers. She carried 
her opposition so far as to imprison him in the fortress of San 
Giovanni. Toward the end of the second year of his imprisonment Thomas 
made his escape, and, the opposition on the part of his relatives 
having ceased, he was allowed to proceed to Paris in the company of 
John of Germany. He does not seem to have tarried at Paris for any 
length of time, but to have gone at once to Cologne, where Albert was 
teaching. This was in 1244 or 1245. Albert perceived at once the 
extraordinary talents of his pupil, and when Thomas' fellow-students, 
failing to detect the intellectual greatness hidden under an extreme 
modesty of manner, surnamed him the "Dumb Ox," Albert foretold the 
future renown of his pupil: "Nos vocamus istum bovem mutum, sed ipse 
adhuc talem dabit in doctrina mugitum quod in toto mundo sonabit."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> 
Tocco<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> describes the student Thomas as
 <!--
LIFE OF ST. THOMAS 345
 --><A NAME="p345"></a>
 follows: "Coepit miro modo taciturnus esse in silentio, in studio 
assiduus, in oratione devotus, interius colligens in memoria quad 
postmodum effunderet in doctrina."<p>

Soon after his arrival at Cologne, Thomas was sent to Paris in company 
with Albert. There they remained until 1248. When, in 1248, Albert was 
recalled to Cologne, it was decided that his illustrious pupil should 
once more accompany him, and continue to study under his direction. In 
1251 or 1252, by order of the General of the Dominicans, Thomas 
repaired to Paris, where he undertook the task of expounding the 
<i>Books of Sentences</i>. In 1256 (this is the most probable date)<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> 
St. Thomas received the degree of master, and was placed at the head of 
the school at St. James as <i>regens primarius</i>. It is probable, 
however, that, on account of the conflict between the mendicants and 
the seculars, the solemn <i>inceptio</i> did not take place until 1257. 
Mention has already been made of the part which St. Bonaventure and St. 
Thomas took in the controversy arising out of this dispute and in the 
efforts of the mendicants to secure a favorable decision from Rome.<p>

While fulfilling his task as bachelor, or assistant professor, St. 
Thomas composed his <i>Commentaries on the Books of Sentences</i>. 
After his promotion to the duties of master of sacred science he 
continued to teach and write, taking up special points treated in 
elementary fashion by the bachelor who taught under his direction, and 
devoting himself to the thorough discussion of each doctrine in all its 
bearings. His fame as a teacher rapidly spread throughout Europe and, 
in obedience to the commands of his superiors, he taught successively 
at Rome, Bologna, Viterbo, Perugia, and Naples. In his lectures as well 
as in his writings, St. Thomas was actuated by a twofold purpose: he 
strove, first, to defend the truth against the attacks of its enemies, 
and, secondly, to build up a system of theology and philosophy. The 
<i>Summa contra Gentiles</i> and the <i>Summa Theologica</i> are proof 
of his ability both as an apologist and as a constructive thinker. The 
former work, begun at Paris about the year 1257 and completed sometime 
between the years 1261 and 1264, was undertaken at the request of St. 
Raymund of Pennafort for the purpose of defending Catholic truth 
against the Arabian pantheists and their followers. The latter work was 
begun at Bologna about the year 1271. It is St. Thomas' greatest work, 
his last and most important contribution to Christian theology and 
 <!--
346 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
 --><A NAME="p346"></a>
 philosophy. For, though the work is entitled <i>Summa Theologica</i>, 
and is, in fact, a summary of Catholic theology, it is also a summary 
of philosophy. It begins with the question of the existence of God, 
treats of the attributes of God, traces the process of things from God, 
and the return of man to God through Christ by means of the sacraments 
which Christ instituted. It treats, therefore, of the creation and 
government of the universe, of the origin and nature of man, of human 
destiny, of virtues, vices, and laws -- of all the great problems of 
speculative and practical philosophy. It is the key to the thought of 
St. Thomas: it contains the views of his more mature years, and 
whenever discrepancies occur between the doctrines of the <i>Summa</i> 
and the views expressed in his earlier works, the <i>Summa</i> is 
always to be taken as the embodiment of the "mind" of St. Thomas.<p>

During his career as professor, St. Thomas composed also the 
<i>Quaestiones Disputatae</i> and the <i>Quodlibeta</i>. When a 
problem, arising out of the interpretation of Aristotle or of the 
Lombard, was so complicated that its discussion would occupy too much 
space in the Scholastic commentary, or was so difficult as to puzzle 
the bachelor, whose duty it was to expound the text of Aristotle or of 
the Lombard, it was made the subject of a special treatise by the 
master, and such treatises were called <i>Quaestiones Disputatae</i>. 
The <i>Quodlibeta</i> were answers to questions put to the master by 
pupils or by outsiders. When, therefore, we find the following among 
the questions answered by St. Thomas: Did St. Peter sin mortally when 
he denied Christ? Does a crusader who is returning from the Holy Land 
die a better death than one who is going thither? Do the damned rejoice 
at the sufferings of their enemies?<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> we should admire the gentle 
forbearance with which he strove to remove the difficulties that lay in 
the way of minds less gifted than his.<p>

After the completion of the first and second parts of the <i>Summa 
Theologica</i>, St. Thomas took up his abode at the convent of his 
order in Naples and there devoted himself to the completion of the 
third part. At the end of a year and a half, having reached the 
ninetieth question, he felt that he could proceed no farther with the 
work, and when his faithful friend Reginald urged him to continue, he 
answered in all simplicity, "Non possum." In obedience, however, to the 
command of Gregory X, he set out for Lyons at the beginning of the year 
1274 in order to attend the council that was being held in that city. 
He fell sick on the way, and when the Cistercian monks of Fossa Nuova, 
near Maienza, invited him to their cloister, he accepted their 
invitation. There he spent the last days of his life among the sons of 
St. Benedict, whose brethren at Monte Cassino had watched 
 <!--
PHILOSOPHY OF ST. THOMAS 347 
 --><A NAME="p347"></a>
 over his early education, and there, on March 7, he died while 
expounding the Canticle of Canticles.<p>

<b>Character</b>. Contemporary biographers and the witnesses whose 
depositions are to be found in the <i>Acts</i> of canonization bear 
testimony to the exalted sanctity of the Angelic Doctor; the <i>Pange 
lingua</i>, the <i>Lauda Sion</i>, and the prayers which he composed 
for the office of the Blessed Sacrament testify to his great piety. 
Every page of his philosophical and theological works reveals the 
author's single-minded devotion to truth, his courtesy towards his 
opponents, and his extraordinary grasp of the great principles of 
Scholastic philosophy and theology. Tocco describes him as "magnus in 
corpore et rectae staturae quae rectitudini animae respondet . . . animum 
nulla sensualis passio perturbabat, nullius rei premebat affectio 
temporalis, nec ullius honoris inflabat ambitio . . . intro modo 
contemplativus et coelestibus deditus."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Sources</b>. The principal editions of the works of St. Thomas are 
the following: the Roman edition of 1570 (known as the edition of Pius 
V), the Venetian edition of 1592, the Paris edition of 1660, the Parma 
edition of 1852, and the Leonine edition begun by the Dominicans at 
Rome in 1882 by order of Leo XIII. The works of St. Thomas may be 
grouped as follows: (1) commentaries on the works of Aristotle; (2) 
commentaries on the Books of Sentences; (3) exegetical works, i.e., 
commentaries on the Scriptures, and collections of the opinions of 
Patristic exponents of the text (<i>Catena Aurea</i>); (4) commentaries 
on the Pseudo-Dionysian treatise <i>De Divinis Nominibus</i>, and on 
the Boethian treatises <i>De Hebdomadibus</i> and <i>De Trinitate</i>; 
(5) <i>Summa contra Gentiles, Summa Theologica, Quaestiones Disputatae 
Opuscula</i>, and <i>Quodlibeta</i>.<p>

On the question of the genuineness of the works ascribed to St. Thomas, 
<i>cf.</i> the <i>Dissertatio Critica</i> by De Rubeis, which is prefixed to the 
Leonine and other editions.<p>

PHILOSOPHY OF ST. THOMAS<p>

In treating of the philosophical system of St. Thomas it will be found 
convenient to consider: (1) St. Thomas' notion of science, doctrine of 
the interrelation of sciences, doctrine of universals, theory of 
knowledge; (2) logic; (3) anthropology; (4) cosmology; (5) metaphysics, 
including natural theology; and (6) moral and political doctrines. 
 <!--
348 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p348"></a><p>

<b>1. Notion of Science, etc.</b> <i>(a) Science</i> is the knowledge 
of things through their causes. Scientific knowledge differs from 
knowledge in general in this, that it gives the cause, or wherefore, of 
a phenomenon or event. It is, therefore, defined as a knowledge of 
principles;<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> for, when we define science as a knowledge through 
causes, we mean primarily those intrinsic causes, or principles, which 
constitute the unalterable natures of things and underlie their 
external, shifting, sense-perceived qualities. And, since it is on the 
unalterable natures of things that laws are based, science may be 
defined as the knowledge of laws: it is concerned with what is 
changeable and contingent in so far as the changeable and contingent 
contains the necessary and universal, which is the true object of 
scientific knowledge.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>(b) Faith and Reason</i>. Intimately associated with the notion of 
science is the notion of truth. Truth is defined as "adaequatio rei et 
intellectus."<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> Now God is the source of all truth. He communicates it 
to us directly by revelation and indirectly by giving us the power by 
which we acquire it. Science acquired in the former manner would be 
divine, while the science which we ourselves derive from experience and 
reason is human. Theology is partly divine and partly human. It is 
divine in its origin, for it starts with revealed truths as principles; 
and it is human in the course of its development, for it proceeds from 
premise to conclusion by the aid of reason. The distinction between 
divine science and human science is not a distinction of material 
objects, that is, of the truths with which each is concerned, but 
rather a distinction of formal objects, that is, of the point of view 
from which the same truths are studied in each science. The difference 
between theology and philosophy does not consist in the fact that 
theology treats of God, for philosophy also treats of God and divine 
truths; the distinction consists rather in this, that theology views 
truth in the light of divine  
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' NOTION OF SCIENCE, ETC. 349 
 --><A NAME="p349"></a>
 revelation, while philosophy views truth in the light of human reason. 
This is the first and broadest distinction between theology and 
philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup><p>

There are truths which belong exclusively to theology, there are truths 
which belong properly to philosophy, and there are truths which are 
common to both sciences. The truths which belong exclusively to 
theology are the mysteries of faith, such as the Incarnation and the 
Trinity, which the human mind can neither demonstrate nor comprehend. 
These we know on the authority of God, Who revealed them. The truths 
which belong exclusively to philosophy are natural truths of the lower 
order; that is, truths which have no bearing on man's destiny or on his 
relations with God. The truths which belong to both sciences are 
natural truths of the higher order, such as the existence of God. 
These, on account of the important relation which they bear to 
supernatural truth, are called the <i>praeambula fidei</i>. They come 
within the scope and power of natural reason, and are, therefore, 
natural; nevertheless, they are proposed for our belief, for, though a 
knowledge of them is <i>possible</i> to all men, it is in point of fact 
attained only by a few (<i>a paucis, et per longum tempus et cum 
admixtione multorum errorum</i>). Considering, on the one hand, the 
vital importance of these truths, and, on the other hand, the 
difficulty of attaining a knowledge of them, it seems natural and 
fitting that God in His goodness should propose them for our 
belief.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> Now, whether we consider the truths which belong 
exclusively to theology, or those which are common to theology and 
philosophy, we realize that the science which studies both classes of 
truths in the light of revelation, and the science which studies the 
latter class of truths in the light of reason, are distinct 
sciences.<p> 

But while it is certain that theology and philosophy are distinct, it 
is no less certain that they are in complete harmony one with the 
other. "Ea quae ex revelatione divina per fidem 
 <!--
350 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p350"></a>
 tenentur non possunt naturali cognitioni esse contraria."<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> This 
principle, which may be said to be implied in every system of Christian 
speculation, is explicitly proved<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> by the following consideration: God 
is the author of all knowledge, natural as well as revealed. It is, 
therefore, He who teaches us, not only when, by means of the revelation 
which He has vouchsafed to grant us, we attain the knowledge of truth 
in the supernatural order, but also when, by the natural powers, which 
also are His gift, we discover truth in the natural order. Now it is 
impossible that God should contradict Himself; it is, therefore, 
impossible that there should exist a contradiction between natural 
truth and truth of the supernatural order.<p>

But this is not all. Not only does faith not contradict reason; it 
strengthens and supplements reason. Faith introduces us into a new 
world of truth, into a world where everything is novel and strange, but 
where, nevertheless, an Intelligent Ruler reigns; where, consequently, 
we find that everything obeys the inexorable laws of thought which rule 
the natural world; for a mystery is not a contradiction. Thus is the 
horizon of knowable truth enlarged by revelation, and faith becomes the 
complement of reason. St. Thomas was fully convinced of the limitations 
of human thought. He did not, it is true, draw the limits of thought so 
closely as Mansel and Spencer have done. He possessed more confidence 
than they in the power of the human mind to attain truth. Still, he 
recognized the principle that the human mind, however high it may soar, 
must sometime or other reach a level beyond which it cannot rise, and 
at which all natural knowledge ends. He differed, however, from the 
agnostic (and the difference is radical) in this, -- that while beyond 
the region of knowledge the modern philosopher places the region of 
nescience, St. Thomas taught that where science ends faith begins, and 
that faith is a kind of knowledge. Faith is the assent to truth on 
account of the authority of God: 
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' DEFINITION OF FAITH 351 
 --><A NAME="p351"></a><p>

<blockquote> 
Assentit autem intellectus alicui dupliciter, uno modo quia ad hoc 
movetur ab ipso objecto quod est per seipsum cognitum, sicut patet in 
primis principiis, quorum est <i>intellectus</i>, vel per aliud 
cognitum, sicut patet in conclusionibus, quarum est <i>scientia</i>. 
Alio modo intellectus assentit alicui, non quia sufficienter movetur ab 
objecto proprio sed per quamdam electionem voluntarie declinans in unam 
partem . . . et si quidem hoc sit cum dubitatione et formidine alterius 
partis, erit <i>opinio</i>, si autem sit cum certitudine, absque tali 
formidine, erit <i>fides</i>.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> 
</blockquote><p>

Faith, therefore, in so far as it depends on the will is meritorious, 
while in so far as it is a firm assent and excludes doubt it adds to 
our knowledge. Knowledge, coextensive with reality, is divided into the 
realm of science and the realm of faith, and these realms are 
continuous. Moreover, all faith is radically reasonable; for belief 
rests on the authority of God, and reason tells us that God can neither 
deceive nor be deceived:<p>

<blockquote>
Dicendum quod ea quae subsunt fidei dupliciter considerari possunt: uno 
modo, <i>in speciali</i>, et sic non possunt esse simul visa et credita 
alio modo <i>in generali</i>, scilicet sub communi ratione credibilis, 
et sic sunt visa ab eo qui credit. Non enim crederet nisi videret ea 
esse credenda.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

From the foregoing principles it follows that science can aid faith (1) 
by furnishing the motives of credibility and by establishing the 
preambles of faith; (2) by supplying analogies which enable us to 
represent to ourselves truths of the supernatural order; (3) by solving 
the objections which the opponents of faith urge against supernatural 
truth. St. Thomas subscribed to the twofold principle of Scholasticism: 
<i>Credo ut intelligam; intelligo ut credam</i>.<p>

St. Thomas' doctrine concerning the relations between revelation and 
reason may be summed up in the propositions: (1) <i>the domain of faith is 
distinct from the domain of reason;</i> (2) <i>the former is a continuation 
of the latter</i>. Here we find expressed the thought which agitated the 
minds of the schoolmen during the first two periods of Scholasticism --
the thought, namely, 
 <!--
352 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p352"></a>
 that revelation is reasonable and that reason is divine. This thought, 
which was held in solution in every system of Scholasticism from the 
extreme mysticism of Erigena to the extreme rationalism of Abelard 
(both of whom, though for different reasons, identified theology with 
philosophy), is now at last crystallized, and the Protestant as well as 
the Catholic apologist of Christianity will to-day acknowledge that 
nowhere can there be found a better statement of the relation between 
revelation and reason than in the principles formulated by St. Thomas. 
The doctrine of St. Thomas on this point is of interest not merely to 
the apologist, but also to the philosopher; for every effort at 
philosophical construction is an effort at establishing continuity. The 
Greeks, while they distinguished mind and matter, taught that there 
exists no antagonism between them, and it was in a similar spirit of 
constructive synthesis that St. Thomas, while clearly distinguishing 
the province of theology from that of philosophy, established once for 
all the continuity of the supernatural with the natural, of revelation 
with reason. It is this aspect of the question that gives it its 
importance in the history of philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>(c) Division of sciences</i>. St. Thomas divides the sciences, in 
accordance with Aristotle's scheme of classification, into physical, 
mathematical, and metaphysical.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> All science is abstraction, that is, 
separation, or analysis, of the complex totality of phenomena; the 
physical, mathematical, and metaphysical sciences represent ascending 
grades of abstraction.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>(d) Doctrine of universals</i>. All science is concerned with the 
abstract and, therefore, with the universal: of singular things, in so 
far as they are singular, there is no science. But the universal, 
though abstract, is real. St. Thomas regards the nominalist denial of 
the reality of universals as a denial of the reality  
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' DOCTRINE OF UNIVERSALS 353
 --><A NAME="p353"></a>
 of all science. He does not, however, agree with the Platonic 
realists, who teach that the universal exists outside the mind <i>as a 
universal</i>, in the same way as it exists in the mind. The universal 
existed <i>ante rem</i> in the mind of God, as exemplar cause; it 
exists <i>post rem</i> in the human mind, as an idea or image extracted 
from concrete things; and it exists <i>in re</i>, as the essence or 
quiddity of things; but the universal <i>in re</i> is not formally 
universal: the mind, reflecting that the universal quiddity is 
predicable of many, invests this quiddity with the <i>formal aspect of 
universality</i>.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> 

<blockquote><p>
Quod est commune multis non est aliquid praeter multa nisi sola 
ratione.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> Cum dicitur universale abstractum, duo intelliguntur, 
scilicet ipsa natura rei et abstractio seu universalitas. Ipsa igitur 
natura rei cui accidit vel intelligi vel abstrahi vel intentio 
universalitatis, non est nisi in singularibus: sed hoc ipsum quod est 
intelligi vel abstrahi vel intentio universalitatis, est in 
intellectu.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Licet natura generis et speciei numquam sit nisi in his individuis, 
intelligit tamen intellectus naturam speciei et generis non 
intelligendo principia individuantia: et hoc est intelligere 
universalia.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Universalia, secundum quod sunt universalia, non sunt nisi in anima. 
Ipsae autem naturae, quibus accidit intentio universalitatis, sunt in 
rebus.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

The sciences, therefore, are real because the universal is real. The 
sciences, however, differ in many respects: the same method is not to 
be employed in different sciences, neither is the same certitude to be 
sought in each.<p>

Ad hominem bene disciplinatum, id est, bene instructum, pertinet ut 
tantum certitudinis quaerat in unaquaque materia quantum natura rei 
patitur.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Theology rests on the authority of revelation; in the other sciences 
the principal means of arriving at truth is the use of our own reason 
and the employment of induction or deduction, according to the nature 
of the science. <i>Authority</i> holds a very unimportant place: 
"Studium sapientiae non est ad hoc quod 
 <!--
354 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p354"></a>
 sciatur quid homines senserint, sed qualiter se habeat veritas 
rerum."<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> St. Thomas maintains that in matters scientific the argument 
from authority is the weakest of all arguments,<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> and thus condemns 
those who would solve the problems of philosophy by an appeal to the 
works of Aristotle or of some other master.<p>

<i>(e) Theory of knowledge</i>. St. Thomas' theory of knowledge is 
conditioned by his psychological doctrines. It is possible, however, to 
describe his epistemological doctrines in general terms without 
entering, for the present, into an account of his psychological system.<p>

All knowledge begins with sense-knowledge.<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> The senses, the 
intellectual faculties, and the authority of others are the sources of 
our knowledge, and, in normal conditions, they are reliable sources. 
With respect to the senses, St. Thomas, following Aristotle, 
distinguishes four classes of objects, the <i>sensibile per se</i>, the 
<i>sensibile per accidens</i>, the <i>sensibile proprium</i>, and the 
<i> sensibile commune</i>.<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> The <i>sensibilia propria</i> are color, 
taste, sound, etc., and the <i>sensibilia communia</i> are size, 
motion, shape, etc. The former exist potentially in the object, 
independently of the sense; actually, however, taste, for example, does 
not exist except when it is perceived.<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup> But, while St. Thomas makes 
this concession to idealism, he maintains, in opposition to the 
fundamental tenet of the idealists, that what we first perceive is not 
the mental process, which takes place within us, but the physical 
counterpart of that process, which exists in the world outside us. He 
is an advocate of <i>presentative</i>, or <i>immediate</i>, as opposed 
to <i>representative</i>, or <i>mediate</i>, perception: he teaches 
that the senses are in immediate contact with the object, as far as 
consciousness is concerned, although, as we  
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 355 
 --><A NAME="p355"></a>
 shall see, he holds that between the senses and the object there are 
certain media of communication (<i>species sensibiles</i>), which do 
not appear in direct consciousness.<p>

<blockquote> 
Quidam posuerunt quod sensus non sentit nisi passionem sul organi sed 
haec opinio manifeste apparet falsa. . . . Species <i>secundario</i> 
est id quod intelligitur: id quod intelligitur <i>primo</i> est

He explains the <i>illusions of sense</i> by referring them to one or 
other of the following causes: (1) the sense-organ is not in its normal 
condition; (2) it is a question of a sensibile <i>per accidens</i>, not 
of a <i>sensibile per se</i>.<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> With regard to the <i>sensibilia 
communia</i>, St. Thomas does not realize the important part played by 
interpretation in processes which are apparently cases of intuitive 
perception. He admits, however, the fact that interpretation plays a 
part in these processes: "Naturas sensibilium qualitatum cognoscere non 
est sensus sed intellectus."<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Intellectual knowledge is derived from sense-knowledge. The intellect, 
by its immaterial energy, separates, or puts aside, all the material 
conditions of the sense-image, leaving the immutable, universal element 
which represents itself on the mind as an immaterial idea. The process 
is one of <i>abstraction</i> or <i>separation</i>. If, then,
 sense-knowledge is a source of truth, intellectual knowledge is also a 
source of truth; for the mind adds nothing to the sense-image; it 
merely brings to light the intellectual element therein contained.<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup><p>

But, though it is customary to speak of the truth of the senses and of 
the truth of the act by which the intellect abstracts universal ideas, 
yet truth full-fledged, so to say, is not found except in judgment and 
reasoning.<sup><small><a name="n35"><a href="#n_35">{35}</a></a></small></sup> Now, we form a judgment by virtue of an innate power of the 
mind, by what may be called a natural sensitiveness to the light of 
evidence,  --  and propositions, as they present themselves to us, are 
evident either 
 <!--
356 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p356"></a>
 immediately or through the medium of other and more evident 
propositions. In this way, by the power of judgment, we arrive at a 
knowledge of <i>first principles</i>, and at a knowledge of conclusions 
which, when organized, is properly called <i>science</i>.<p>

But what is knowledge? St. Thomas describes it as a vital process in 
which the subject is rendered like the object by a process of 
<i>information</i>: "Omnis cognitio fit per assimilationem cognoscentis 
et cogniti."<sup><small><a name="n36"><a href="#n_36">{36}</a></a></small></sup> He likens it to the process by which the seal impresses 
its form on the wax. The object, whether it be composed of matter and 
form or be pure form, is what it is by virtue of the form. Now, when 
the object becomes known, it impresses its form on the mind, causing 
the mind not to be the object, but to know the object. Moreover, in the 
act of knowledge, subject and object become one in the ideal order,<sup><small><a name="n37"><a href="#n_37">{37}</a></a></small></sup>
 -- an expression which means merely that the object becomes known by 
us and we become knowing the object. Beyond these somewhat general 
expressions St. Thomas does not attempt to describe the nature of 
knowledge, realizing perhaps the impossibility of describing knowledge 
in terms more elementary than the term knowledge itself.<p>

<b>2. Logic</b>. In logic, St. Thomas did not make any notable addition 
to the doctrine of Aristotle. The <i>opusculum</i> entitled <i>Summa 
Totius Logicae</i>, which was ascribed to St. Thomas, is the work of 
some disciple of the saint, perhaps of Herv&eacute; of Nedellec (died 
1323). It is a compendium of the treatises which formed the body of 
Aristotelian logical doctrine.<p>

<b>3. Anthropology</b>. The central doctrine in St. Thomas' teaching 
concerning man is that of the substantial union of soul and body. Body 
and soul are co-principles of the substantial unit which is man: they 
are united as matter and form. Complete substantial nature belongs 
neither to the soul alone nor to the body alone, but to the compound of 
both: it is the compound which is and acts. It is by virtue of the soul 
that man is a 
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' ANTHROPOLOGY 357 
 --><A NAME="p357"></a>
 rational being, a substance, a being: it is by virtue of the soul that 
the body has whatever it possesses. But just as the body requires the 
soul in order to be what it is and to move and live, the soul requires 
the body for its natural being and operation.<sup><small><a name="n38"><a href="#n_38">{38}</a></a></small></sup> It is true that the 
soul is superior to matter, that in the highest operations of the mind 
it is intrinsically independent of the body, and that it is capable of 
surviving the body; but it is none the less true that there is no 
operation of the soul, however high, in which the body has not its 
share, and that, after its separation from the body, the soul is, as it 
were, in an unnatural state until it is reunited with the body after 
the body's resurrection.<sup><small><a name="n39"><a href="#n_39">{39}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>The soul</i> is defined as <i>primum principium vitae in his quae 
<i>apud</i> nos vivunt</i>,<sup><small><a name="n40"><a href="#n_40">{40}</a></a></small></sup> and life is defined as self-originating 
motion: "Illud enim proprie vivere dicimus quod in seipso habet 
principium motus vel operationis cujuscumque."<sup><small><a name="n41"><a href="#n_41">{41}</a></a></small></sup> Thus, although the 
eye, the heart, etc., are principles of vital functions, they are not 
the radical principles of those functions; for if these, as bodies, 
were the <i>first</i> principles of life, all bodies would be endowed 
with life.<sup><small><a name="n42"><a href="#n_42">{42}</a></a></small></sup> The soul is therefore the radical principle of all vital 
functions.<p> 

Since <i>life</i> is the power of self-motion, or, as we should say, 
the power of adaptation, living beings are arranged in a scale of 
ascending perfection according to the degree in which they possess the 
power of self-motion. In this way St. Thomas is led to distinguish 
plant life, animal life, and intellectual life, and to this distinction 
corresponds the distinction of vegetative soul, sensitive soul, and 
rational soul.<sup><small><a name="n43"><a href="#n_43">{43}</a></a></small></sup> All life is a triumph of form over matter, of activity 
over inertia, of initiative force over indeterminateness, and the 
greater the triumph the higher the form of life. 
 <!--
358 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p358"></a><p>

The soul, then (and by soul is meant not merely mind, but the principle 
of <i>all</i> vital activity), is united substantially with the body. 
The union is no mere accidental union, as Plato taught; for 
consciousness tells us that it is the same substance which thinks and 
speaks and moves and eats.<sup><small><a name="n44"><a href="#n_44">{44}</a></a></small></sup> Neither are there forms intermediate 
between soul and body, as the Neo-Platonists taught;<sup><small><a name="n45"><a href="#n_45">{45}</a></a></small></sup> for although 
there is no quantitative contact between soul and body, there is the 
contact of immediate action and reaction (<i>contactus virtutis</i>), 
as the facts of consciousness prove. Thus does St. Thomas, taking his 
stand on the empirical principles of consciousness, simplify the 
problems of epistemology by regarding man as the blending of what in 
modern epistemology would be called self and not-self, and by refusing 
to look upon subject and object as separated by that chasm which every 
epistemologist since the days of Descartes has striven in vain to 
span.<sup><small><a name="n46"><a href="#n_46">{46}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The soul is one, inextended, immaterial. Its immateriality is proved by 
the fact that in its intellectual operations it rises above all 
material conditions. It is present in every part of the body, although 
it does not exercise all its functions in each part of the body -- it 
is present <i>totalitate essentiae</i>, but not <i>totalitate 
virtutis</i>.<sup><small><a name="n47"><a href="#n_47">{47}</a></a></small></sup> But, though the soul is one, it has several 
<i>faculties</i>, or immediate principles of action. In the <i>Summa 
Theologica</i><sup><small><a name="n48"><a href="#n_48">{48}</a></a></small></sup> the necessity of admitting the existence of faculties 
of the soul is proved by metaphysical reasons; in <i>De Spiritualibus 
Creaturis</i><sup><small><a name="n49"><a href="#n_49">{49}</a></a></small></sup> the same conclusion is reached from considerations of a 
psychological nature. The faculties of the soul are (1) 
<i>locomotive</i>; (2) <i>vegetative</i>, or <i>nutritive</i>; (3) 
(cognitive) <i>sensitive</i>; (4) (cognitive) <i>intellectual</i>; and 
(5) <i>appetitive</i>, which includes sensitive appetite and rational 
appetite, or will. This division is expressly attributed to 
Aristotle.<sup><small><a name="n50"><a href="#n_50">{50}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' ANTHROPOLOGY 359 
 --><A NAME="p359"></a><p>

All the faculties of the soul are vital, and their operations are 
immanent. Some, however, are wholly dependent on states of the 
organism, while others are immaterial, that is, independent of bodily 
states, or, more generally, of all the conditions of matter. To this 
class belong the intellectual faculties. St. Thomas, it is true, admits 
that, as Aristotle taught, there is nothing in the intellect which did 
not come through the senses; nevertheless he maintains, and in this he 
is true to Aristotelian principles, that there is an essential 
distinction between sense and intellect. <i>The intellect is 
incorporeal</i><p>

(a) Because we can know incorporeal things:<p>

<blockquote>
Nihil agit nisi secundum suam speciem, eo quod forma est principium 
agendi in unoquoque. Si igitur intellectus sit corpus, actio ejus 
ordinem corporum non excedet. Non igitur intelliget nisi corpora. Hoc 
autem patet esse falsum: intelligimus enim multa quae non sunt corpora. 
Intellectus igitur non est corpus.<sup><small><a name="n51"><a href="#n_51">{51}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

(b) Because of our power of reflection:<p>

<blockquote>
Nullius corporis actio reflectitur supra agentem. Intellectus autem 
supra seipsum agendo reflectit. Intelligit autem seipsum non solum 
secundum partem, sed secundum totum. Non est igitur corpus.<sup><small><a name="n52"><a href="#n_52">{52}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

(c) Because of the universality and necessity which the idea possesses:<p>

<blockquote>
Propria operatio hominis, in quantum hujusmodi, est intelligere: per 
hanc enim differt a brutis. Intelligere autem est universalium et 
incorruptibilium, in quantum hujusmodi.<sup><small><a name="n53"><a href="#n_53">{53}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

<i>The intellect</i>, although immaterial and therefore intrinsically 
independent of the body, <i>depends on the body extrinsically</i> and, 
as it were, accidentally; for the soul, being the weakest and most 
imperfect of spiritual substances, being, in fact, substantially 
incomplete without the body, cannot exercise its intellectual functions 
without the cooperation of the bodily senses. Having no innate ideas, 
it must obtain the matter of thought from 
 <!--
360 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p360"></a>
 the world outside; the senses are, therefore, the channels of 
communication between the soul and the objects of knowledge. This 
extrinsic, or accidental, dependence of intellect upon sense explains 
the phenomenon of mental fatigue:<p>

<blockquote>
Si vero in intelligendo fatigetur corpus, hoc est per accidens, in 
quantum intellectus indiget operatione virium sensitivarum, per quas ei 
phantasmata praeparentur.<sup><small><a name="n54"><a href="#n_54">{54}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

Intellect, therefore, while it transcends the world of sense, is 
accompanied in all its operations by bodily states, to which the 
operations of the intellect are correlated. St. Thomas is as careful to 
avoid the ultra-spiritualism of those who deny all interaction or 
correlation between the acts of the intellect and the organism, as he 
is to avoid the materialism of those who make the acts of the intellect 
depend intrinsically on material conditions. His doctrine on this 
point, while it in no way compromises the spiritual and immaterial 
nature of the principle of pure thought, leaves full scope to empirical 
psychology and to psychophysical investigation.<p>

From the distinction between intellect and sense, St. Thomas infers the 
conclusion that the <i>soul is immaterial</i>. It is a principle of 
Scholastic philosophy that action is, so to speak, a measure of 
existence: <i>agere sequitur esse</i>. The effect cannot be greater 
than the sum of its causes: if, therefore, the intellect, in the 
processes of pure thought, transcends all material conditions, it 
follows that the soul, which is the radical principle of such 
processes, is itself immaterial.<p>

<blockquote>
Sic igitur ex operatione animae humanae modus esse ipsius cognosci 
potest. In quantum enim habet operationem materialia transcendentem, 
esse suum est supra corpus elevatum, non dependens ab eo.<sup><small><a name="n55"><a href="#n_55">{55}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

The <i>immortality of the soul</i><sup><small><a name="n56"><a href="#n_56">{56}</a></a></small></sup> follows from its immateriality. 
The proofs of immortality, although differently enunciated in  
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' DOCTRINE OF IMMORTALITY 361 
 --><A NAME="p361"></a>
 different portions of the writings of St. Thomas, may be said to 
converge on one line of argument: the soul is immaterial; therefore it 
is naturally incorruptible. For instance, in the <i>Quaestio Disputata 
De Anima</i><sup><small><a name="n57"><a href="#n_57">{57}</a></a></small></sup> St. Thomas argues that a compound is subject to 
corruption <i>per se</i> by the loss of the form which gives it being, 
while a form, although incorruptible <i>per se</i>, may be corruptible 
<i>per accidens</i>; that is to say, it is liable to destruction if it 
is merely that by which the compound is, and if it has no being 
independently of the compound. Now, the soul is a form, and therefore 
it is not corruptible <i>per se</i>. It is a form independent of the 
body as to its highest operations, and therefore it is independent of 
the body as to its being; consequently it is not corruptible <i>per 
accidens</i>. Therefore neither <i>per se</i> nor <i>per accidens</i> 
is the soul subject to corruption. Towards the end of the article in 
which the foregoing argument is enunciated, St. Thomas shows that all 
who denied the natural immortality of the soul did so either (1) 
because they held that the soul is a material substance; or (2) because 
they held that the soul is intrinsically dependent on matter even in 
its intellectual operations; or (3) because they held that the 
principle of intellectual knowledge is not a faculty of the individual 
soul, but something separate (<i>intellectus separatus</i>), which is 
immortal, while the individual soul is corruptible. The argument is 
repeated in <i>Contra Gentiles</i>, II, 55; in II, 79, of the same 
work, the form of the argument is slightly changed:<sup><small><a name="n58"><a href="#n_58">{58}</a></a></small></sup> the soul is 
perfected by knowledge and virtue. Now, all knowledge and all virtue 
are conditioned by a certain degree of separation from matter: every 
idea that we acquire, every act of virtue that we  
 <!--
362 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p362"></a>
 perform, lifts us above the material conditions of life and adds to 
the perfection of the soul. Death, therefore, which is a complete 
separation of the soul from matter, perfects rather than destroys the 
soul.<p>

Arguing from the same empirical principles, -- principles, namely, 
which are founded on a study of the operations of the mind, -- St. 
Thomas concludes that <i>the soul is created</i>. If the soul, in its 
intellectual acts, rises above the conditions of matter, it is 
impossible that the soul could be produced by material forces: matter 
cannot produce an immaterial effect. For the same reason -- because of 
its immateriality -- the soul cannot by any agency be evolved out of 
the potency of matter. It follows that it is created.<sup><small><a name="n59"><a href="#n_59">{59}</a></a></small></sup> At the moment 
of creation the soul is infused into the body: "Creando infunditur et 
infundendo creatur," is the Scholastic formula. The soul is naturally 
destined for the body; there is, consequently, no reason why it should 
exist before its union with the body, as Plato taught.<p>

It will be perceived that St. Thomas' system of rational psychology is 
based on experience. The central doctrine of this system -- the 
substantial union of soul and body in man -- is inferred from the facts 
of consciousness, revealing to us the oneness of the vital principle 
from which proceed not merely our intellectual actions, but also every 
other function of the living organism. It is from the facts of 
consciousness that the nature of the idea is determined, and from the 
universality and necessity of the idea are deduced in turn the 
immateriality and immortality of the soul, as well as the creationist 
hypothesis of the origin of the soul. The method of St. Thomas' 
psychology is, therefore, empirical, and not, as is too frequently 
alleged, <i>a priori</i>. It is true that St. Thomas appeals to such 
maxims and formulas as "Agere sequitur esse." But it should be 
remembered that such formulas are not <i>a priori</i> principles or 
premises arbitrarily assumed; they are conclusions established by 
empirical 
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 363 
 --><A NAME="p363"></a>
 or rational investigation, and, as such, are perfectly legitimate 
principles of rational psychology -- in the same way as the law of the 
conservation of energy, the law of the division of physiological labor, 
or any other generalization inductively established, has its legitimate 
application in physics or biology.<p>

<i>Genesis of knowledge.</i> St. Thomas teaches that there are no 
innate ideas: that the mind is at first a <i>tabula rasa</i>, pure 
potency in the intellectual order, just as <i>materia prima</i> is pure 
potency in the physical order. All knowledge begins with
 sense-knowledge: "Nihil est in intellectu quod prius non fuerit in 
sensu." Thus, for example, he says:<sup><small><a name="n60"><a href="#n_60">{60}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<blockquote>
Deficiente aliquo sensu, deficit scientia eorum quae apprehenduntur 
secundum ilium sensum; sicut caecus natus nullam potest habere notitiam 
de coloribus.
</blockquote><p>

The intellect, it is true, knows itself by its own act, but the act of 
the intellect presupposes the previous exercise of the senses.<sup><small><a name="n61"><a href="#n_61">{61}</a></a></small></sup><p>

St. Thomas does not discuss in detail the nature of sensation, nor the 
manner and mechanism of the process of sense-perception. He simply 
describes in a general way the conditions of sense-knowledge and the 
action of the object on the senses. Sensation, he teaches, is the act 
by which the object produces a modification in the animated organism. 
The senses, therefore, are purely passive or, at most, reactive; they 
do not produce anything; they neither make the object nor do they, as 
modern theories of apperception maintain, group together the qualities 
of the object and unify them. The object acts; the senses react: 
"Sensus non est virtus activa sed passiva . . . sensus autem comparatur 
ad sensibile sicut patiens ad agens, eo quod sensibile transmutat 
sensum."<sup><small><a name="n62"><a href="#n_62">{62}</a></a></small></sup> The reaction is described as follows:<p>

<blockquote>
Sentire, quantum ad ipsam receptionem speciei sensibilis, nominat 
passionem . . . sed, quantum ad actum consequentem ipsum sensum perfectum 
per speciem, nominat operationem.<sup><small><a name="n63"><a href="#n_63">{63}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote>
 <!--
364 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p364"></a>
 Confining our attention to the passive phase of sensation, we next 
inquire, What is the nature of <i>the change produced by the object in 
the organism</i>? It is neither wholly material nor wholly immaterial; 
it is a vital change. It is not entirely material, because color, for 
example, is not received in the eye in such a way as to color the eye; 
neither is the change purely immaterial, because we are speaking of the 
modification of material organs by material qualities. When, therefore, 
St. Thomas uses the phrase <i>immutatio spiritualis</i><sup><small><a name="n64"><a href="#n_64">{64}</a></a></small></sup> to designate the 
change produced in the organs of sense-perception, he uses it as 
opposed to <i>immutatio naturalis</i>, or wholly material change. This 
"spiritual" change is the famous <i>species sensibilis</i>, which is  
consequently nothing but a <i>passio</i>, or <i>affectio</i>, of the 
peripheral sense-organs, a mode of motion, and by no means a 
substantial entity. Now, according to a metaphysical principle well 
known to St. Thomas as a Peripatetic formula, <i>actio</i> and 
<i>passio</i> are but two phases of the same reality, like the concave 
and the convex of the same curve.<sup><small><a name="n65"><a href="#n_65">{65}</a></a></small></sup> The action of the object and the 
modification produced by it in the sense are one and the same 
phenomenon, and the <i>species sensibilis</i> may therefore be defined 
as <i>the physical determinant of sensation, inasmuch as it is received 
in the animated organism</i>. The <i>species sensibilis</i> is not a 
miniature object; neither is it something which we first perceive in 
sensation, and by means of which we are led to perceive the object. It 
is merely the vital phase of the stimulative action of the external 
object, -- a medium of communication between object and subject, but 
not a medium in the order of knowledge; for in normal conditions it 
does not rise into direct consciousness at all, the first thing 
perceived being the object itself. It is called a species because by 
means of it (in the sense just explained) the object is perceived.  
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 365  
 --><A NAME="p365"></a><p>

This detailed explanation of the Thomistic doctrine of <i>species 
sensibilis</i> is rendered necessary by the persistent 
misrepresentation of that theory on the part of many writers on 
Scholastic psychology.<sup><small><a name="n66"><a href="#n_66">{66}</a></a></small></sup> The misunderstanding is perhaps to be 
explained by the fact that St. Thomas has little to say about the 
<i>species sensibilis</i>. In the <i>Summa Theologica</i><sup><small><a name="n67"><a href="#n_67">{67}</a></a></small></sup> he merely 
points out the difference between the Aristotelian doctrine of 
<i>species</i> and the atomistic doctrine of effluxes, and adds that 
the <i>species</i> is a mode of motion:<p>

<blockquote>
Operationes sensitivae partis causantur per impressionem sensibilium in 
sensum, non per modum defluxionis, ut Democritus posuit, sed per 
quamdam operationem. 
</blockquote><p>

St. Thomas does not attempt to explain in what this <i>operatio</i> -- 
this mode of motion, or as we should call it, vibration -- consists.<p>

Returning now to the study of the active phase of the process of 
sensation, we find that according to St. Thomas, the species is first 
impressed on the sense (<i>species impressa</i>); then consciousness 
responds and by the <i>actus consequens impressionem</i> writes out, so 
to speak, a representation of the object, called the <i>species 
expressa</i>. Sensation in the passive phase is not knowledge; for 
there is no knowledge without consciousness: it is only in the active 
phase that sensation becomes knowledge properly so called.<sup><small><a name="n68"><a href="#n_68">{68}</a></a></small></sup><p>

But how do we <i>rise from sense-knowledge to intellectual 
knowledge</i>? how do we derive from the world of material things the 
universal and immaterial, which is the object of pure thought? St. 
Thomas recalls, in his answer to this question, the Aristotelian 
distinction between active and passive intellect. These, he maintains, 
are two faculties, not one and the same power viewed under two 
different aspects.<sup><small><a name="n69"><a href="#n_69">{69}</a></a></small></sup> The object as it presents itself to the senses is 
indeed contingent and singular; but,  
 <!--
366 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p366"></a>
 hidden beneath the surface qualities, which give to the object its 
individuality and contingency, is the unalterable nature, or essence, 
which is universal and necessary. The <i>active intellect</i>, by 
virtue of its illuminative power, separates what is contingent and 
particular from what is necessary and universal in the object, in this 
way causing the universal and necessary element in the object to stand 
forth in the clear light of its own intelligibility, and rendering 
actually intelligible what was only potentially intelligible before. 
The actually intelligible element acts upon the passive, or receptive, 
intellect in the same way as color acts upon the eye, producing the 
<i>species intelligibilis impressa</i>; on being received into 
intellectual consciousness, this impression becomes the intellectual 
expression of the object in the mind, the mental image of the object 
(<i>species intelligibilis expressa, verbum mentis</i>).<sup><small><a name="n70"><a href="#n_70">{70}</a></a></small></sup> The idea 
which results from this abstractive process has a twofold aspect: 
entitatively considered, it is an accident or quality of the mind in 
which it is; representatively considered, it is an image, or 
representation, of the object, functioning, not as a medium in which we 
see the object, -- for that would be to open the door to subjectivism, 
-- but as a medium by which the object acts on our consciousness. The 
analogy between the function of the <i>species intelligibilis</i> and 
that of the <i>species sensibilis</i> is perfect<sup><small><a name="n71"><a href="#n_71">{71}</a></a></small></sup><p>

With regard to the <i>chronological order of the genesis of our 
ideas</i>, St. Thomas holds that the first idea which the human mind 
acquires is the idea, or notion, of Being. By the notion of Being we 
must not understand a definite concept, such as the idea of Being which 
is the object of metaphysical analysis, but a vague concept of reality 
more aptly expressed by the word <i>thing</i> than by the word 
<i>Being</i>. St. Thomas adopts Avicenna's formula: "Quod primum cadit 
in intellectu est ens." It is only after a long process of training 
that the mind, by reflecting on 
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' PSYCHOLOGY 367 
 --><A NAME="p367"></a>
 its own acts, comes to know itself. The senses, the natural windows 
of the soul, are open on the side which looks out on the external 
world; consequently, our first knowledge is sense-knowledge, and the 
first idea which we glean from sense-knowledge is naturally the most 
imperfect, that is, the vaguest and least definite of notions, -- the 
idea of Being.<sup><small><a name="n72"><a href="#n_72">{72}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Ontologists have endeavored to cite the authority of St. Thomas in 
favor of their doctrine that (1) God is the first object of our 
knowledge, and (2) in this knowledge of God we know all things else. 
St. Thomas, it need hardly be said, is far from confounding with the 
idea of God the idea of Being in general, which is the first object of 
knowledge, and the constant substratum and indefinite residuum in all 
our processes of ideation. He is careful to keep apart the concept of 
Being and the concept of God; for the former is merely an abstraction 
of the mind, existing as such nowhere except in the mind, and the 
latter is the representation of the first and greatest reality. When, 
therefore, he says, "(Entis) intellectus includitur in omnibus 
quaecumque quis apprehendit,"<sup><small><a name="n73"><a href="#n_73">{73}</a></a></small></sup> he is speaking of the idea of Being 
which ia the substratum of all our ideational processes, and when he 
says that we see all things in God, he explains his meaning as 
follows:<p> 

<blockquote>
Omnia dicimur in Deo videre et secundum Ipsum omnia judicare, in

The <i>emotions</i> are treated by St. Thomas under the name 
<i>passiones</i>, by which word, following St. Augustine, he translates 
the Greek word <b>path&ecirc;</b>. It may seem strange to us that the 
schoolmen should treat of the emotions in connection with appetite  
 <!--
368 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
 --><A NAME="p368"></a>
 and will, refusing, apparently, to recognize the importance of the 
emotions as mental states deserving to be coordinated with cognitive 
and volitional states in a classification of mental phenomena. Still, 
when we examine the nature of the emotions, we shall realize that they 
are intimately connected with volitional or appetitive states -- that 
all emotion is, in a certain sense, a response to good or evil 
perceived.<p>

St. Thomas defines passion in its broadest sense as the change from a 
state to its contrary, or, more strictly, from a more perfect to a less 
perfect state.<sup><small><a name="n75"><a href="#n_75">{75}</a></a></small></sup> The soul, being incorporeal, has no contrary states; 
still, by reason of the body it can pass from a more perfect to a less 
perfect state, and may be said by reason of the body to have contrary 
states.<sup><small><a name="n76"><a href="#n_76">{76}</a></a></small></sup> All the passions belong to the sensitive appetite, and are 
divided into two great classes, <i>passiones concupiscibiles</i> and 
<i>passiones irascibiles</i>, according as they belong to the 
concupiscible appetite, which has for object the good or evil as 
agreeable or repugnant in itself, or to the irascible appetite, which 
has for object the good apprehended as subject to some circumstance of 
difficulty or danger.<sup><small><a name="n77"><a href="#n_77">{77}</a></a></small></sup> The emotions of the higher, or more spiritual, 
kind, that is, those which belong to the intellectual appetite, are not 
passions properly so called, because they do not imply a 
<i>transmutatio corporalis</i>.<sup><small><a name="n78"><a href="#n_78">{78}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Will</i> is the faculty which has for its object the good 
apprehended by reason. Appetite is concerned with the good, just as 
cognition is concerned with the <i>true</i>. Cognition goes before 
appetite, and the nature of the latter depends on the nature of the 
former: sensuous appetite, the tendency towards what is good for the 
body, follows sense-perception; rational appetite, or will, the 
tendency towards the rational good, follows intellectual knowledge. As 
the intellect cannot but assent to first principles, so the will cannot 
but tend towards good in general, <i>bonum 
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' COSMOLOGY 369
 --><A NAME="p369"></a>
 commune</i>. With regard, therefore, to good in general, there is no
freedom of choice.<sup><small><a name="n79"><a href="#n_79">{79}</a></a></small></sup> Choice is possible only in reference to 
particular goods. Now, the intellect presents a particular good in
such a manner that, while we perceive it to be good, we perceive
at the same time, that, without it, good in general, or universal
good, may be attained. This perception is the ground of freedom. 
The root of freedom (<i>radix libertatis</i>) is, therefore, the
reason, and freedom of choice (<i>liberunt arbitrium</i>) may be said
to include the action of the intellect as well as that of the will.
"Pro tanto necesse est quod homo sit liberi arbitrii ex hoc ipso
quod rationalis est."<sup><small><a name="n80"><a href="#n_80">{80}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Comparing intellect and will, St. Thomas decides that, absolutely 
speaking, intellect is superior to will; although if we consider that 
the object of will perfects the will, and that some of the objects of 
will are superior to the object of intellect, we must, he says, decide 
that in this respect (<i>secundum quid</i>) will is superior to 
intellect.<p>

<blockquote>
Melior est amor Dei quam cognitio; e contrario autem, melior est 
cognitio rerum corporalium quam amor. Simpliciter tamen, intellectus 
est nobilior quam voluntas.<sup><small><a name="n81"><a href="#n_81">{81}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

<b>4. Cosmology</b>. The eternity of the world is not contrary to 
reason, in this sense, that, absolutely speaking, God could have 
created something, <i>ab aeterno</i>; and therefore the origin of the 
world in time is not a truth demonstrable by reason.<sup><small><a name="n82"><a href="#n_82">{82}</a></a></small></sup> The world, as 
it exists, is good. Its goodness is apparent if we consider the end for 
which it was created. It is not, however, the most perfect world 
possible; for God in His infinite power could and can create a more 
perfect world.<sup><small><a name="n83"><a href="#n_83">{83}</a></a></small></sup> The world was created out of nothing. For all finite 
being, whether potential or actual, is dependent on God. Even eternal 
matter, if it existed before the production of the first forms of 
actual being, 
 <!--
370 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p370"></a>
 must have originated by virtue of the Divine Will. "Creatio est 
emanatio totius esse ex non ente, quod est nihil."<sup><small><a name="n84"><a href="#n_84">{84}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Every created being is composed, as we shall see, of potency and 
actuality. Everything in the visible universe is composed of matter and 
form. Matter is potency; <i>materia prima</i> is utter indetermination, 
-- potentiality and nothing more. It is described as "ingenerabilis et 
incorruptibilis; una, unitate ordinis tantum." And, again: "omnium 
generabilium et corruptibilium est eadem materia. . . . Est sua 
potentia passiva, sicut Deus est potentia activa."<sup><small><a name="n85"><a href="#n_85">{85}</a></a></small></sup> Form confers 
actuality and specific determination: "Forma, secundum id quod est, 
actus est, et per eam res actu existunt."<sup><small><a name="n86"><a href="#n_86">{86}</a></a></small></sup> Form is the principle of 
action and being: in living things it is the principle of life, and in 
all material things it is the source of all qualities, even of 
impenetrability and extension. It is important, in view of modern 
theories of matter, to note that according to the schoolmen the actual 
extension of a body is due to the form, although the potency of 
extension comes from the matter. It is because matter contains the 
potency of extension that St. Thomas says, "Quantitas se tenet ex parte 
materiae."<sup><small><a name="n87"><a href="#n_87">{87}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The form is the source of all actuality in material substances; it is 
the determining principle, causing the substance to be what it is: it 
is, therefore, the principle of specific distinction. The principle of 
individuation, namely, that by which individuals of the same species 
are differentiated, is matter, -- not matter in general, for that 
enters into the specific definition, and is common to all members of 
the species, but matter terminated by its dimensions, "Materia 
determinatis dimensionibus signata."<sup><small><a name="n88"><a href="#n_88">{88}</a></a></small></sup> It  
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' COSMOLOGY 371
 --><A NAME="p371"></a>
 follows from this (and St. Thomas admits the inference) that, since 
the angelic nature is form without matter, there is no numerical 
distinction among spiritual substances: "Sequitur quod impossibile sit 
esse duos angelos unius speciei."<sup><small><a name="n88"><a href="#n_88">{88}</a></a></small></sup> "Quot sunt individua, tot sunt 
species."<sup><small><a name="n89"><a href="#n_89">{89}</a></a></small></sup> The human soul is like the angelic nature inasmuch as it is 
spiritual, but unlike it inasmuch as it is the substantial form of the 
body. It is individuated by the body, and after its separation from the 
body each soul still retains a certain <i>habitudo ad corpus</i> which 
distinguishes it from other human souls.<sup><small><a name="n90"><a href="#n_90">{90}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The principle, "Omne quod movetur, quantum ad aliquid manet et quantum 
ad aliquid transit,"<sup><small><a name="n91"><a href="#n_91">{91}</a></a></small></sup> is the basis of the Thomistic as it was of the 
Aristotelian doctrine of matter and form. Both St. Thomas and Aristotle 
assumed that there are substantial changes, and, in order to explain 
substantial change, they postulated the existence of two substantial 
principles, the one (<i>matter</i>) permanent and the other 
(<i>form</i>) transient.<p>

<i>Space</i>, although real, is not something distinct from the 
dimensions of existing bodies; it is not infinite, for it is 
coterminous with the limits of the actual universe, beyond which 
nothing exists except potential space.<sup><small><a name="n92"><a href="#n_92">{92}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Time</i>. St. Thomas accepts the Aristotelian definition of time. In 
the <i>Summa Theologica</i><sup><small><a name="n93"><a href="#n_93">{93}</a></a></small></sup> he teaches that it is the mind which 
<i>alternates</i> the present instant, thus, as it were, constituting the 
flow, or succession which is time: "Fluxus ipsius nunc, secundum quod 
alternatur ratione, est tempus." And in the <i>Commentaries on the 
Books of Sentences</i><sup><small><a name="n94"><a href="#n_94">{94}</a></a></small></sup> he quotes with approval the Aristotelian 
principle, "Si non esset anima, non esset tempus."<p>

Neither St. Thomas nor any of his contemporaries imagined the 
<i>heavenly bodies</i> to be composed of the same matter as that 
 <!--
372 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p372"></a>
 of the physical world around us. The matter of the terrestrial world 
is made up of the four elements; celestial matter is different from 
terrestrial matter or is, at most, only analogous to it.<sup><small><a name="n95"><a href="#n_95">{95}</a></a></small></sup> The 
heavenly bodies are incorruptible, because in them the form fills all 
the potency of the matter: "Illa forma sic perficit illam materiam quod 
nullo modo in ea remanet potentia ad esse, sed ad ubi tantum."<sup><small><a name="n96"><a href="#n_96">{96}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>5. Metaphysics and Natural Theology</b>. <i>Being</i> is that which 
exists or can exist either in the mind or outside the mind.<sup><small><a name="n97"><a href="#n_97">{97}</a></a></small></sup> It is 
opposed to <i>Not-Being (nihil)</i>. The notion of Being is peculiar in 
this, that it can neither be defined nor divided, because of the 
simplicity of its comprehension and the universality of its extension. 
Being is, therefore, reduced to lower classes, such as substance, 
animal, man, not by adding some <i>difference</i> distinct from Being 
itself, but by bringing out explicitly in the lower classes what is 
implicitly contained in the comprehension of the notion of Being in 
general. Hence, Being is not to be predicated univocally of its lower 
classes.<sup><small><a name="n98"><a href="#n_98">{98}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Being is the most universal of notions; it is, in fact, 
<i>transcendental</i>, that is to say, extending above and beyond all 
classes. It includes the highest reality as well as the lowest, --  
God, Who is pure actuality, as well as <i>materia prima</i>, which is 
mere potency. Between these two poles of existence range all created 
beings; for in everything created there is a dual composition of 
actuality and potency, <i>actus et potentia</i>. Even in the highest of 
the angels, immaterial as he is, there is not only a composition of 
essence and existence, -- of that by which he is, and the act of 
existence, -- but also a composition of substance and accident. In 
material things there is a threefold composition: (1) of essence 
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' METAPHYSICS 373
 --><A NAME="p373"></a>
 and existence; (2) of substance and accident; and (3) of matter and 
form. God alone is free from all composition; in Him there is no matter 
or potency of any kind: His essence is His existence, His action is His 
substance, He is pure actuality, <i>Actus Purus</i>.<sup><small><a name="n99"><a href="#n_99">{99}</a></a></small></sup> Thus does the 
metaphysics of St. Thomas point heavenward not only in the ultimate 
problems of the existence and nature of God, but also in its initial 
concept, -- the dualism of all created being.<p>

The principles of being in the ontological order (<i>prima principia 
essendi</i>) are the four causes, -- <i>matter, form, efficient 
cause</i>, and <i>final cause</i>. Each of these is, in its own way, a 
cause, in so far as the effect depends on it.<sup><small><a name="n100"><a href="#n_100">{100}</a></a></small></sup> The principles of 
being in the logical order (<i>prima principia cognoscendi</i>) are 
immediate analytical truths, sometimes known as <i>axiomata</i> or 
<i>dignitates</i> . The first of these, the starting point of all 
demonstration, is the <i>principle of contradiction</i>; for just as the 
notion of Being is the first object of the act of ideation and that on 
which all subsequent ideation is based, so the principle of 
contradiction, which springs, as it were, from the first elementary 
analysis of the notion of Being, is the first object of the act of 
judgment and the foundation on which all our other judgments 
rest.<sup><small><a name="n101"><a href="#n_101">{101}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The highest classes of being are the categories, -- <i>substance</i>, 
etc. St. Thomas, following Aristotle, distinguishes the <i>first 
substance</i>, which is the individual, or hypostasis, and the 
<i>second substance</i>, which is the universal substantial nature 
abstracted from the individual. First substance really exists as such. 
Second substance does not exist as such, except in the mind. It is the 
quiddity, or essence, which is expressed by the definition, and which, 
as thus defined, exists in the mind alone; for in concrete things it is 
individuated.<sup><small><a name="n102"><a href="#n_102">{102}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 374 
 --><A NAME="p374"></a><p>

The existence of God is a truth which is <i>per se nota quoad se</i>. 
The proposition God exists is analytical; for if we could comprehend 
the subject of the proposition, we should see immediately that it 
includes the predicate, -- that of itself the Divine Nature includes 
existence. But we cannot adequately comprehend the subject of the 
proposition. For us, therefore (<i>quoad nos</i>), the proposition 
<i>God exists</i> is not self-evident or analytical. Consequently it 
must be demonstrated.<sup><small><a name="n103"><a href="#n_103">{103}</a></a></small></sup><p>

St. Thomas, after examining and rejecting<sup><small><a name="n104"><a href="#n_104">{104}</a></a></small></sup> St. Anselm's ontological 
argument, proceeds<sup><small><a name="n105"><a href="#n_105">{105}</a></a></small></sup> to point out the five ways in which, by arguing 
from effect to cause (<i>a posteriori</i>), the existence of God may be 
proved. These ways are: (1) from the principles that whatever is moved 
is moved by something else (<i>quidquid movetur ab alio movetur</i>), 
and that an infinite series of moving agents is impossible (<i>non est 
procedere in infinitum</i>); (2) from the relation between cause and 
effect, -- "Non est possibile quod in causis efficientibus procedatur 
in infinitum" ; (3) from the relation of the contingent to the 
necessary, -- "Si omnia sunt possibilia non esse, aliquando nihil fuit 
in rebus: non ergo omnia entia sunt possibilia, sed oportet aliquid 
esse necessarium in rebus"; (4) from the different degrees of 
perfection in things which exist, -- "Magis et minus dicuntur de 
diversis, secundum quod appropinquant diversimode ad aliquid quod 
maxime est"; (5) from the order and adaptation of the universe, -- "Ea 
quae non habent cognitionem non tendunt in finem, nisi directa ab aliquo 
cognoscente et intelligente."<p>

But although we can know that God exists we cannot comprehend what He 
is. Not even in that unobstructed vision of the Divine Nature which 
constitutes the supreme happiness of the blessed in heaven can the 
human mind fully and adequately comprehend the nature of God.<sup><small><a name="n106"><a href="#n_106">{106}</a></a></small></sup> 
Nevertheless, even in this life we can attain an imperfect knowledge of 
what God 
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' MORAL AND POLITICAL DOCTRINES 375 
 --><A NAME="p375"></a>
 is; for we can proceed (1) by way of analogy, that is, by purifying 
from all imperfection attributes which denote perfection in created 
things, and predicating of God attributes thus sublimated; and (2) by 
way of negation, that is, by excluding from God such attributes as 
imply imperfection, and thus determining what God is not.<sup><small><a name="n107"><a href="#n_107">{107}</a></a></small></sup> Proceeding 
by this twofold method, St. Thomas shows that God is pure actuality 
(<i>Actus Purus</i>); from which it follows that He is infinite, 
perfect, one, immutable, eternal, etc.<p>

In relation to creatures, God is <i>Creator</i> and <i>Preserver</i>. 
He is the first efficient cause on whom all finite being depends, -- 
for He made all creatures out of nothing; He is also the first exemplar 
cause, because He made all things according to the ideas, or types, 
which existed in the Divine Mind through all eternity. He is, moreover, 
the preserver and ruler of the world; He watches over all His creatures 
and conserves them; for without His sustaining hand they would return 
to the nothing out of which He brought them.<sup><small><a name="n108"><a href="#n_108">{108}</a></a></small></sup> He cooperates in all 
our actions, in the natural as well as in the supernatural order.<sup><small><a name="n109"><a href="#n_109">{109}</a></a></small></sup> 
Finally, He is the ultimate end for which all things were made, and to 
which all rational creatures tend to return.<sup><small><a name="n110"><a href="#n_110">{110}</a></a></small></sup><p>

This last consideration brings us to St. Thomas' ethical doctrines.<p>

<b>6. Moral and Political Doctrines</b>. The object of all appetite is 
the good; the end of all human action is happiness. Universal good, 
which is the conscious or unconscious aim of all rational action, is 
fully realized in the infinite good, which is God. God alone, as St. 
Augustine taught, can fill the void of the human heart; and man will 
not rest until he attains the happiness which leaves no desire 
unsatisfied. St. Thomas teaches that it is derogatory to the dignity of 
man to seek final and ultimate happiness in anything short of the 
infinite good.<sup><small><a name="n111"><a href="#n_111">{111}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--
376 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p376"></a><p>

Although the knowledge and love of God, in which consists the enjoyment 
of the infinite good, are to be fully realized only in the next life, 
yet here on earth there is an imperfect form of happiness which man may 
attain. "Aliqualis beatitudinis participatio in hac vita haberi potest; 
perfecta autem et vera beatitudo non potest haberi in hac vita."<sup><small><a name="n112"><a href="#n_112">{112}</a></a></small></sup> As 
constituents of this imperfect happiness, St. Thomas mentions health, 
external goods, and the society of friends.<sup><small><a name="n113"><a href="#n_113">{113}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The moral goodness or evil of an action depends ultimately on whether 
the action leads to or averts from the end for which man was created, 
and proximately on the object, circumstances, and purpose of the action 
itself.<p>

<blockquote>
Omnis actio in quantum habet aliquid de esse in tantum habet de 
bonitate; in quantum vero ei aliquid deficit de plenitudine essendi, in 
tantum deficit a bonitate et sic dicitur mala.  
</blockquote><p>

If object, circumstances, and end (intention) are good, the action is 
good; if any of these is evil, the action is evil. Hence the Scholastic 
adage, "Bonum ex integra causa; malum ex quocumque defectu."<sup><small><a name="n114"><a href="#n_114">{114}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Virtue</i> is defined,<sup><small><a name="n115"><a href="#n_115">{115}</a></a></small></sup> "Bona qualitas mentis, qua recte vivitur, 
qua nullus male utitur." The theological virtues -- faith, hope, and 
charity -- are infused; natural virtues, whether intellectual or moral, 
are acquired by exercise in the actions pertaining to such virtues, 
although the aptitude for one virtue or another, as well as the general 
aptitude for virtue, is part of the natural endowment of man.<p>

<blockquote>
Virtutes in nobis sunt a natura secundum aptitudinem et inchoationem, 
non autem secundum perfectionem, praeter virtutes theologicas, quae 
sunt totaliter ab extrinseco.<sup><small><a name="n116"><a href="#n_116">{116}</a></a></small></sup> 
</blockquote><p>

St. Thomas follows the Aristotelian classification of 
moral virtues, basing it on the division of the objects of the 
passions.<sup><small><a name="n117"><a href="#n_117">{117}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--
ST. THOMAS' MORAL AND POLITICAL DOCTRINES 377 
 --><A NAME="p377"></a>
 Sometimes<sup><small><a name="n118"><a href="#n_118">{118}</a></a></small></sup> he divides moral virtues into four principal, or 
cardinal, virtues.<p>

<i>Law</i> is the extrinsic principle of morality. It is defined 
"Quaedam ordinatio rationis, ad bonum commune ab eo qui curam 
communitatis habet promulgata."<sup><small><a name="n119"><a href="#n_119">{119}</a></a></small></sup> A law, therefore, in order to be 
obligatory, must be reasonable; it must be for the good of the 
community; it must issue from the proper authority, and it must be duly 
promulgated. St. Thomas distinguishes <i>eternal</i>, or <i>divine, 
law; natural law</i>, which is a participation of the divine law and is 
promulgated by being written "in the fleshly tables of the heart"; and 
<i>positive law</i>,<sup><small><a name="n120"><a href="#n_120">{120}</a></a></small></sup> which is a derivation from eternal law and is 
divided into <i>divine, ecclesiastical</i>, and <i>civil law</i>.<sup><small><a name="n121"><a href="#n_121">{121}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>The State</b>. The treatise <i>De Regimine Principis</i> is now 
universally conceded to be the work of two authors. The first two books 
are undoubtedly to be ascribed to St. Thomas;<sup><small><a name="n122"><a href="#n_122">{122}</a></a></small></sup> the other two were 
added by some disciple, probably by Ptolemy of Lucca. In the first two 
books of <i>De Regimine Principis</i>, in the commentaries on the 
<i>Politics</i> of Aristotle, and elsewhere in his different works St. 
Thomas expounds the following political doctrines.<p>

(a) Man is naturally ordained for the society of his fellowmen: "Est 
homini naturale quod in societate multorum vivat."<sup><small><a name="n123"><a href="#n_123">{123}</a></a></small></sup><p>

(b) Authority in civil society must have in view the public good; if it 
lose sight of this, it becomes unjust, anti-social, and 
tyrannical.<sup><small><a name="n124"><a href="#n_124">{124}</a></a></small></sup> Tyrannical authority is held in check by the authority 
of the Church, which provides for the spiritual welfare of all the 
faithful, and has the power, at least in the case  
 <!--
378 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p378"></a>
 of the apostasy of the tyrant, to absolve his subjects from obedience 
on the ground that the ruler is an apostate.<sup><small><a name="n125"><a href="#n_125">{125}</a></a></small></sup> Besides, if the rule of a 
tyrant is contrary to public good or to divine law, it ceases to bind 
in conscience.<sup><small><a name="n126"><a href="#n_126">{126}</a></a></small></sup><p>

(c) Tyrannical power is also held in check by the <i>popular will</i>. 
Tyrannicide is to be condemned.<sup><small><a name="n127"><a href="#n_127">{127}</a></a></small></sup> The redress to which the subjects of a 
tyrant have a just right must be sought, not by an individual, but by 
an authority temporarily constituted by the people and acting according 
to law.<p>

<blockquote>
Nec putanda est talis multitudo infideliter agere tyrannum destituens 
etiam si eidem in perpetuum se ante subjecerat: quia hoc ipse meruit in 
multitudinis regimine se non fideliter gerens.<sup><small><a name="n128"><a href="#n_128">{128}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

(d) The <i>aim of the state</i> is not merely economical, but also 
moral; and from this principle St. Thomas deduces conclusions which are 
in remarkable accordance with modern political theories -- for example, 
that it is the duty of the state to provide for the education of all 
its members and to see that no citizen suffers want.<sup><small><a name="n129"><a href="#n_129">{129}</a></a></small></sup><p>

(e) St. Thomas has no predilection for one <i>form of government</i> 
rather than another. He argues, on general grounds, that the unity of 
society is better secured by the rule of jine than by the rule of the 
few or of the many. Still, he maintains that the aristocratic and 
democratic forms of government are as legitimate as the monarchical 
form. He sets forth the advantages of a constitution in which all have 
a voice in the government of the state, "Ut omnes aliquam partem 
habeant in principatu: per hoc enim conservatur pax populi,"<sup><small><a name="n130"><a href="#n_130">{130}</a></a></small></sup> and 
he lays down the general principle that it is not the form of 
government, but the fidelity with which the government adheres to 
 <!--
HISTORICAL POSITION OF ST. THOMAS 379
 --><A NAME="p379"></a>
 the purpose for which it is instituted, that decides the happiness and 
prosperity of the subjects.<sup><small><a name="n131"><a href="#n_131">{131}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. An organic synthesis of the elements of 
thought contained in preceding systems is as real an advance in the 
development of philosophy as is the introduction of elements absolutely 
new. In the one as well as in the other respect, the philosophy of St. 
Thomas is to be pronounced an advance in philosophic thought.<p>

St. Thomas synthesized the more or less fragmentary truths which, 
during the preceding centuries, the schoolmen had slowly gathered 
together, as well as the elements of thought which, during the early 
part of the century in which he lived, Scholasticism had derived from 
Greek and Arabian sources. He perfected the Scholastic method, and 
consecrated to the service of truth the dialectic which rationalists 
had abused and which mystics had denounced. He gave to the doctrine of 
moderate realism its final expression, and enunciated a theory of 
universals which united what is true in Platonism with what is true in 
nominalism. He was the first to formulate a complete system of 
Christian Aristotelianism, thus pressing into the service of orthodoxy 
the philosopher to whom Arabian and Jewish unbelievers had looked as 
their champion in the warfare which they waged on Christianity. He 
determined for all time the true relation between faith and reason, 
and, while avoiding the extremes of rationalism and mysticism, gave 
permanent form to the thought which had inspired every Christian 
philosopher since the days of Justin, the first of the great 
apologists. And all this he accomplished not so much by creating as by 
transforming and assimilating. With a comprehensiveness of purpose 
which, in these modern times, seems nothing short of stupendous, he 
laid broad and deep the foundations of his vast synthetic system, and 
with a force and directness less easily to

 be attained in the rich confusion of modern thought, compelled every 
source of knowledge to yield him material for his work. He drew from 
the Scriptures, from the Fathers, from the philosophers of Greece and 
Rome, from his predecessors in the Christian schools, and from 
contemporary Arabian and Jewish philosophers. It detracts neither from 
the recognized importance of those who preceded St. Thomas, nor from 
his own just title to praise as an original thinker, to say that he 
perfected the work of his predecessors, and, from materials which they 
supplied, reconstructed the edifice of Christian philosophy.<p>

What is new and wholly original in the work of St. Thomas is the spirit 
in which he addressed himself to his task -- the sense of completeness 
which impelled him to leave nothing incomplete or imperfect except in 
so far as everything human must be incomplete and imperfect; the mind 
appreciative of the value of truth wheresoever truth is found, and the 
belief, stronger and more deep-rooted in him than in any other 
schoolman, that all truth and all knowledge, from whatever source it is 
derived, is capable of harmonious adjustment.<p>

In point of detail, St. Thomas contributed to Scholastic philosophy the 
doctrines by which the Dominican tradition was distinguished from the 
Franciscan teaching, -- the oneness of the substantial form in each 
individual, the doctrine of subsistent forms, the denial of the 
<i>rationes seminales</i> in the sense in which they were admitted by 
St. Bonaventure, and the affirmation of the real distinction between 
the soul and its faculties. It was on these points that, as we shall 
see, Thomists and anti-Thomists came to be divided.<p>

It is only when, as we study the history of later Scholasticism and the 
history of the philosophy of modern times, we shall look back to the 
thirteenth century through the perspective of ages of less successful 
attempts at philosophical synthesis, that we shall begin to realize the 
true grandeur of the most commanding figure in the history of mediaeval 
thought.<p>
