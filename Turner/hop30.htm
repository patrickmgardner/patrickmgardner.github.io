ST. ANSELM</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. St. Anselm is a type of Scholastic altogether different 
from Roscelin and Abelard. He was born at Aosta in Lombardy, in 1033. 
In 1060 he entered the monastery of Bec. In 1078 he succeeded Lanfranc 
as abbot of Bec, and in 1093 became Lanfranc's successor in the 
archiepiscopal see of Canterbury. As primate of England he resisted 
with extraordinary firmness the encroachments of the secular power. He 
died in 1109. His life, written by his friend and disciple, Eadmer, a 
monk of Canterbury, is published by Migne.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Sources. The works of St. 
Anselm<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> include the following treatises: <i>Monologium, Proslogium, 
De Veritate, De Libero Arbitria, De Fide Trinitatis</i> (against 
Roscelin), <i>Cur Deus Homo?</i> (on redemption and atonement), <i>De 
Incarnatione Verbi</i>, and <i>Dialogus de Grammatico</i>. Among recent 
additions to our secondary sources mention must be made of Rule's 
<i>Life and Times of St. Anselm</i> (2 vols., London, 1883) and Vigna, 
<i>Sant' Anselmo, Filosofo</i> (Milan, 1899), Rigg, <i>S. Anselm of 
Canterbury</i>, London, 1896.

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Problem of Universals</b>. St. Anselm seems to have attempted a 
compromise between the exaggerated realism of Erigena and the 
nominalism of Roscelin. He is a realist, as appears from his refutation 
of Roscelin and from his use of the term <i>substance</i> to designate 
the universal. But what is his precise position as to the manner in 
which the universal exists outside the mind? In the first place, he is 
clearly and unmistakably an Augustinian Platonist as to the existence 
of universals <i>ante rem</i> in the mind of God.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> In the second 
place, he speaks of goodness (and what he says of goodness he implies 
to be true of other universals) as existing "in diversis, sive in illis 
aequaliter, sive inaequaliter consideretur." It is impossible to 
determine more accurately St. Anselm's doctrine of universals, because, 
apparently, he did not succeed in finding a more definite answer to 
Porphyry's questions. When, however, he called attention to the sensism 
latent in Roscelin's nominalism, and when, as in <i>Monologium</i>, X, 
he insisted on the distinction between sense by which the singular is 
perceived and intellect by which the universal is known, he <i>prepared 
the way for the moderate realism</i> which is based on a psychological 
analysis, and which could never have been discovered by means of the 
dialectical disputes of Roscelin and Abelard.<p>

<b>Relation of Philosophy to Theology</b>. Faith and reason, far from 
contradicting each other, aid each other. <i>Intelligo ut credam</i> 
has for its complement <i>Credo ut intelligam</i>. Reason, of itself 
feeble and liable to error, is illuminated by the supernatural light of 
faith, so that the new fields of inquiry opened up to it by revelation 
are not beyond its scope. Indeed, St. Anselm attaches more importance 
to the <i>Credo ut intelligam</i> than to the <i>Intelligo ut 
credam</i>.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> The relation between 
 <!--
274 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p274"></a>
 reason and revelation between philosophy and theology -- is further 
elucidated by the following principles:<p>

<blockquote>
Rectus ordo exigit ut profunda Christianae fidei credamus priusquam ea 
praesumamus ratione discutere. Negligentiae mihi esse videtur si 
postquam confirmati sumus in fide, non studemus quod credimus 
intelligere.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

The <i>Credo ut intelligam</i> is evidently an echo of St. Augustine's 
<i>Crede ut intelligas</i>. The <i>Intelligo ut credam</i> is the 
formula of Scholasticism, the justification of the use of dialectic and 
of the application of dialectic to dogma within the limits of 
orthodoxy. It is interesting to note in St. Anselm's philosophy the 
development of another element which is as essential to Scholasticism 
as is the use of dialectic, namely, the union of faith and reason, of 
theology and philosophy. Erigena united the two sciences by identifying 
them; St. Anselm recognizes that they cannot contradict each other, yet 
he contends that each has its separate sphere. It was left for the 
masters of Scholasticism in the thirteenth century to trace the lines 
by which the field of theological inquiry is marked off from the domain 
of philosophy. 
                
<b>St. Anselm's Method</b>. St. Anselm adheres closely to the doctrines 
of St. Augustine. He states explicitly that St. Augustine is his 
favorite author, and that he never said anything which could not be 
corroborated by the writings and sayings of the bishop of Hippo. We are 
not surprised, therefore, to find that both in his philosophical method 
and in the contents of his philosophy Anselm reproduces the Christian 
Platonism of St. Augustine. God and the human soul are for him, as they 
were for his favorite author, the great subjects of inquiry: "Noverim 
me, noverim te!" He starts, for example, with the idea of the good, the 
just, the great, and rises by what has sometimes been called Platonic 
induction to the idea of goodness, justice, greatness, -- to the idea 
of God.  
 <!--
ST. ANSELM 275  
 --><A NAME="p275"></a><p>

<b>Theodicy</b>. In the opening chapters of the <i>Monologium</i> 
Anselm recites the various Platonic and Augustinian arguments for the 
existence of God, -- from the necessity of a permanent, immutable 
standard of justice, goodness, etc., from the evidences of order in the 
universe, and from the gradation of beings. While acknowledging the 
force of these arguments, St. Anselm (as he tells us in the 
<i>prooemium</i> to the <i>Proslogium</i>) began to inquire whether an 
argument could not be found which would of itself be sufficient to 
prove the existence of God. Such a proof he finally discovered and 
formulated in the <i>Proslogium</i>. It is known as the ontological 
argument, and is as follows: We define God as a being than which 
nothing greater can be thought. Now, there is in the mind the idea of 
such a being. But such a being must exist outside the mind; for, if it 
did not, it would not be that than which nothing greater can be 
thought. Therefore, God exists not only in the mind, as an idea, but 
also outside the mind, as a reality. St. Anselm presents the argument 
in two slightly different forms.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> The <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> 
just given is a brief form of the argument as it occurs in the third 
chapter of the <i>Proslogium</i>.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Anselm, in formulating the argument, alluded to the fool 
(<i>insipiens</i>) who, according to the Psalmist, "hath said in his 
heart: There is no God." <b>Gaunilo</b>, a monk of the monastery of 
Marmoutiers, criticised the argument in a work entitled <i>Liber pro 
Insipiente</i>,<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> to which Anseim replied in a <i>Liber Apologeticus 
contra Gaunilonem</i>. The controversy was conducted with the greatest 
courtesy. Gaunilo acknowledged the merit of  
 <!--
276 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p276"></a>
 Anselm's work, and Anselm praised his adversary and thanked him for 
his criticism. At a later time St. Thomas examined the ontological 
argument of St. Anselm and called attention to what is really the fatal 
flaw in every ontological proof, -- the <i>transition from the ideal to 
the real</i>, from the world of thought to the world of things.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> 
Albertus Magnus neither approved nor disapproved the argument. St. 
Bonaventure did not mention it; Duns Scotus adopted it and endeavored 
to give it greater strength; Ockam and Gerson rejected it; and in 
modern times it has been renewed in a slightly different form by 
Descartes and Leibniz. Of Kant's criticism of the argument mention will 
be made in the proper place.<p>

It is necessary to remark that in a philosophy based on the
 ultra-realistic doctrine of universals, according to which the highest 
ideas of the human mind, substance, body, etc., as well as the generic 
concepts, animal, plant, etc., are realities existing as such, one may 
consistently maintain that the highest and most perfect of all our 
ideas -- the idea of a being than which nothing greater can be 
thought -- necessarily possesses objective reality.<p>

From the idea of God as supremely perfect (<i>quo nihil majus cogitari 
potest</i>) St. Anselm deduces a whole system of natural theology: God 
is infinite, eternal, the sum of all perfection, the origin of all 
created being.<p>

<b>Psychological Doctrines</b>. St. Anselm did not compose a separate 
treatise on psychology: the points of doctrine which are here gathered 
under the title "Psychological Doctrines" are found scattered through 
his different works. For instance, in the <i>Monologium</i><sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> he 
describes in general terms the origin of ideas:<p>

<blockquote>
Quamcumque rem mens, seu per corporis imaginationem, seu per rationem. 
cupit veraciter cogitare, ejus utique similitudinem quantum valet in 
ipsa sua cogitatione conatur exprimere.  
</blockquote>
 <!--
ST. ANSELM 27 
 --><A NAME="p27"></a>
 From which one may conclude that our philosopher, rejecting the 
doctrine of innatism, teaches that our ideas are formed from things by 
the abstractive power of the mind. By the words <i>imago, 
exprimere</i>, etc., he suggests the doctrine of <i>intentional 
species</i> which afterwards became so well known in the schools.<p>

In the treatise <i>De Veritate</i>, St. Anseim distinguishes three 
kinds of truth, -- <i>veritas enunciationis, veritas cogitationis</i>, 
and <i>veritas voluntatis</i>. A proposition is true when it expresses 
the relation existing between things; a thought is true when we judge 
(<i>cogitamus</i>) that to be which is, and that not to be which is 
not; the will is true when we will what we ought, to will. The truth of 
the will is moral rectitude. In fact, truth of whatever kind is 
rectitude; truth may, therefore, be defined "Rectitudo sola mente 
perceptibilis."<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In the <i>Monologium</i><sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> he speaks of the immortality of the soul. 
In his treatment of this, as well as of other questions, he deals 
chiefly with the religious and moral aspect of the problem, arguing 
that the soul is immortal because otherwise it could not love and enjoy 
God for all eternity. St. Anselm attached special importance to the 
will and its freedom, devoting to this subject the incomplete treatise 
<i>De Libero Arbitrio</i>, and the more comprehensive work <i>De 
Concordia Praescientiae cum Libero Arbitrio</i>. In these treatises he 
is concerned not so much with proving that the will is free as with 
showing that freedom does not consist in the power of sinning, that no 
will is so free as that of the righteous man, and that neither 
temptation nor sin can take away our freedom so long as we live.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Moral Doctrines</b>. Like St. Augustine, St. Anselm is at pains to 
show that evil is merely the absence or negation of good. Passing from 
the notion of evil to that of moral good (<i>rectitudo</i>), he 
identifies the latter with justice. Man, he teaches, should do good for 
the sake of the good itself: "propter ipsam rectitudinem." 
 <!--
278 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
  --><A NAME="p278"></a>
  Herein Anselm's teaching apparently approaches very near to the 
Kantian doctrine of autonomous will and moral purism. The resemblance 
is, however, merely apparent. St. Anselm never intended us to forget 
that, while the good, for its own sake, is the immediate motive of 
action, the ultimate reason of all moral action is the will of God.' 
Moral evil (injustitia), since it is a negation, does not require a 
cause. Physical evil such as pain, blindness, etc., which St. Anselm 
calls incommodum, may be a positive thing, and may be caused by God.2<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Perhaps the most important of all the 
theological treatises of the Middle Ages before the time of St. Thomas 
is St. Anselm's <i>Cur Deus Homo?</i> a work in which is propounded the 
Catholic doctrine of redemption and atonement. St. Anselm as a 
theologian does not, however, interest us here. As a philosopher he is 
best known by his ontological argument, which is his most important 
contribution to philosophy. The argument is one of many indications of 
the similarity of our philosopher's method and spirit to the method and 
spirit of St. Augustine. St. Anselm has been styled "the last of the 
Fathers," "the Augustine of the eleventh century." And indeed one 
cannot fail to observe the tendency of his mind to take the 
Augustinian, which is ultimately the Platonic, view of philosophical 
method, -- to proceed by way of descent from the higher to the lower, 
rather than by way of ascent from the lower to the higher, in human 
thought and human knowledge. Still, our saint is a genuine Scholastic, 
a continuator of the tradition of the schools, a precursor of Albert 
and St. Thomas, a genuine representative of the Neo-Latin civilization. 
He is the monk-philosopher. His lifelong training in the cloister left 
its impress on his character as a man and on the style as well as the 
contents of his philosophical works.<p>
