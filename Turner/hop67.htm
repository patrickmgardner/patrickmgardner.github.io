THE SCOTTISH SCHOOL</h3><p>

While German philosophers, inspired by the idea of counteracting the 
scepticism of Hume, were evolving systems of transcendental philosophy 
from the principles laid down by Kant, there was developing in Hume's 
own country a school of philosophy which, although it made common cause 
with transcendentalism against scepticism, reached conclusions very 
different from those of the transcendentalists. Indeed, in the first 
stages of its development, tbe Scottish school was as much opposed to 
transcendentalism as it was to scepticism; for the doctrine of common 
sense is not merely an affirmation of dogmatism, but also a protest 
against absolute idealism.<p>

McCosh, whose work on <i>The Scottish Philosophy</i><sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> is a standard 
authority, regards Reid as the first "fit representative" of the 
Scottish school, although Sir William Hamilton traces the history of 
the school back to <b>Carmichael</b> and <b>Hutcheson</b>. 
 <!--

REID<p>

<b>Life</b>. Thomas Reid (1710-1796), who succeeded Adam Smith as 
professor of philosophy at the University of Glasgow, is the author of 
<i>An Inquiry into the Human Mind on the Principles of Common Sense</i> 
(1764), <i>Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man</i> (1785), and 
<i>Essays on the Active Powers of Man</i> (1788). The edition of Reid's 
works begun by Hamilton (1827) was completed after the latter's death. 
The seventh edition appeared in 1872.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

There are in Reid's philosophy two points of doctrine which deserve 
special attention: his theory of perception and his doctrine of common 
sense.<p>

<b>Theory of Perception</b>. Reid rightly traced the immaterialism of 
Berkeley and the scepticism of Hume to the Cartesian doctrine that what 
we directly and immediately perceive is not the external object, but a 
subjective modification which is an image of the object, -- a doctrine 
which he falsely attributes to the schoolmen.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> In opposition to this 
representative theory of perception, Reid maintains the presentative 
theory, -- that <i>our knowledge of external things is immediate</i>. 
Startled, however, by his own boldness, as Hamilton observes, he 
proceeds to deliver the whole case into the hands of his opponents by 
declaring that the perception of external objects is to be exempted 
from the region of consciousness, so that while he holds that we have 
an immediate perception of external objects, he does not admit that we 
are conscious of such perception.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Doctrine of Common Sense</b>. "Philosophy," Reid teaches, "has no 
other root but the principles of common sense; it grows out of them and 
draws its nourishment from them. Severed from this root, its honours 
wither, its sap is dried up, it dies and rots."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Zeno the Eleatic, 
Pyrrho the sceptic, Berkeley the immaterialist, and Hume the 
phenomenalist overlooked this 
 <!--
594 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p594"></a>
 truth. Hobbes and Descartes, who were equally neglectful of the claims 
of common sense, are accountable for "the present unprosperous state" 
of philosophy.<p>

The principle on which Reid's philosophy is grounded is the following: 
"<i>All knowledge and all science must be built upon principles that 
are self-evident</i>; and of such principles every man who has common 
sense is a competent judge."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> Self-evident truths, such as the axiom of 
causality, are to be exempted from critical inquiry; they are primary 
data of intellectual thought.<p>

In developing this fundamental principle Reid takes advantage of the 
twofold meaning of the term <i>common sense</i>, namely: (1) the 
combination of qualities constituting good sense, or the faculty of 
sound judgment; (2) the aggregate of original principles planted in the 
minds of all men. Hamilton has shown that if we take the latter meaning 
of the term, Reid's argument is a valid and legitimate refutation of 
scepticism.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Not even the most enthusiastic of Reid's 
admirers claim for him the title of great philosopher. "He has not," 
writes McCosh, "the mathematical consecutiveness of Descartes, the 
speculative genius of Leibnitz, the sagacity of Locke, the spirituelle 
of Berkeley, or the detective skill of Hume."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Reid himself was of 
opinion that "it is genius and not the want of it that adulterates 
philosophy." The greatest benefit that Reid conferred on philosophy was 
the importance which he attached, and succeeded in causing others to 
attach, to introspection, or self-observation.<p>

<b>James Oswald</b> (1727-1793) and <b>James Beattie</b> (1735-1803) 
popularized and applied to theological controversy the principles of 
the philosophy of common sense. Mention must also be made of a 
contemporary of Reid, the eccentric author of <i>Ancient  
 <!--
THE SCOTTISH SCHOOL 595
 --><A NAME="p595"></a>
 Metaphysics, or the Science of Universals</i> (Edinburgh, 1779-1799), 
namely, James Burnett, <b>Lord Monboddo</b> (1714-1799).<p>

The philosophy of the Scottish school was developed by Stewart, Brown, 
and Mackintosh before reaching its final phase as represented in the 
philosophy of Hamilton.<p>

DUGALD STEWART<p>

<b>Life</b>. Dugald Stewart (1753-1828) was the most eminent of the 
followers of Reid. His principal work is entitled <i>Elements of the 
Philosophy of the Human Mind</i>. His <i>Collected Works</i> were 
published in ten volumes by Hamilton (Edinburgh, 1854-1858).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Stewart accepts Reid's analysis of perception. While vindicating Reid's 
empirical method of self-observation, he attached greater importance 
than Reid had done to the association of ideas. He protested, however, 
with the utmost vigor against the materialism of the first 
associationists, Hartley, Priestley, and Erasmus Darwin.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

THOMAS BROWN<p>

<b>Life</b>. Thomas Brown (1778-1820), after studying law and medicine 
at the University of Edinburgh, was appointed in 1810 associate 
professor with Dugald Stewart. His chief works are <i>An Inquiry into 
the Relation of Cause and Effect</i> (1804) and <i>Lectures on the 
Philosophy of the Human Mind</i> (1820).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Brown retains the fundamental doctrine of the Scottish school, namely, 
the existence of indemonstrable first principles. He is, however, more 
inclined than were his predecessors to restrict the number of these 
principles and to give larger scope to association in accounting for 
the origin of our universal and  
 <!--
596 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p596"></a>
 necessary beliefs. In his analysis of the processes of sensation he 
attaches great importance to the muscular sense. With regard to 
causation, he teaches that, while the relation of cause and effect is 
merely one of invariable succession, our judgment concerning that 
relation is not the result of association or custom, but a primitive, 
or intuitive, belief.<p>

MACKINTOSH<p>

<b>Life</b>. Sir James Mackintosh (1765-1832) was no less distinguished 
as a statesman, historian, essayist, and critic than as a philosopher. 
His principal philosophical works are a <i>Dissertation on the Progress of 
Ethical Philosophy</i> (contributed in 1830 to the <i>Encyclopaedia 
Britannica</i>), and a <i>Discourse on the Law of Nature and Nations</i> 
(1799).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Mackintosh, while adhering to the original speculative principle of the 
Scottish school, even going so far as to accuse Brown of openly 
revolting against the authority of Reid, departed from the ethical 
tradition of the followers of Hutcheson to the extent of admitting that 
benevolence is the universal characteristic of human virtue. But 
although he betrays here the influence of the utilitarians, he does not 
maintain that the happiness of others is the universal criterion of 
moral conduct. He is inclined rather to side with the intuitionists and 
to insist on the supremacy of the immediate judgment of conscience.<p>

The next representative of the Scottish school is Sir William Hamilton, 
who, under the influence of Kantian principles, developed the 
philosophy of his predecessors, Reid and Stewart, into a more 
comprehensive system. It was, however, inevitable that the introduction 
of foreign elements of speculative criticism should react on the 
dogmatism of the founders of the school, and lead to a partial 
scepticism, which, in the nineteenth century, proved a no less 
formidable foe to theism in religion and 
 <!--
SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON 597
 --><A NAME="p597"></a>
 to absolutism in philosophy than was Hume's scepticism in the 
eighteenth.<p>

SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON<p>

<b>Life</b>. Sir William Hamilton was born at Glasgow in 1788. After 
completing his studies in the department of arts in the university of 
his native city, he took up the study of medicine at Edinburgh. In 1807 
he went to Oxford. After leaving Oxford he began the study of law, and 
in 1813 was admitted to the Scottish bar. In 1821 he was appointed to 
the chair of civil history in the University of Edinburgh. In 1836 he 
was appointed to the chair of logic and metaphysics, which he held 
until his death in 1856.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Besides the <i>Discussions on Philosophy, Literature, 
and Education</i> (1852), the <i>Lectures on Metaphysics</i> (second 
edition, 1866), the <i>Lectures on Logic</i> (second edition, 1866), 
and many important articles in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> (from 1829 
to 1839), Hamilton contributed to English philosophical literature his 
valuable editions of Reid's and Stewart's works. Consult: J. S. Mill's 
<i>Examination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy</i> (London, 1865; 
fifth edition, 1878); Wight's Philosophy of Sir William Hamilton (New 
York, 1854); Bowen's <i>Metaphysics of Sir W. Hamilton</i> (Cambridge, Mass., 
1867); and Veitch's <i>Hamilton</i> (Blackwood's Philosophical Classics, 
Edinburgh and Philadelphia, 1882).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>General View of Philosophy</b>. Hamilton defines philosophy as the 
knowledge of effects in their causes, -- a definition which, as 
Hamilton himself observes, implies that all the sciences are to be 
viewed as so many branches of philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> Philosophy, however, 
differs from the other sciences in having for its primary problem to 
investigate and determine the conditions of knowledge. Consequently, it 
makes mind its first and paramount object of consideration.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> In 
<i>logic, ethics, politics, the philosophy of the fine arts</i>, and 
<i>natural theology</i> the mind is studied "in certain special 
applications," while in metaphysics the mind is studied in itself. Now 
metaphysics, or psychology (for the terms are synonymous), has a 
threefold task: (1) the 
 <!--
598 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p598"></a>
 observation of facts and phenomena of the mind (<i>phenomenology of 
mind</i>); (2) the study of the laws which regulate these facts 
(<i>nomology of the mind</i>); and (3) the study of the "real results" 
which we are warranted in inferring from these phenomena 
(<i>ontology</i>, or metaphysics, properly so called).<p>

<b>Logic</b>. Hamilton's most important contribution to logic is his 
<i>Theory of the Quantification of the Predicate</i>. This theory is 
based on the postulate that "we be allowed to state explicitly in 
language all that is implicitly contained in thought," and on the 
alleged fact that in thought we quantify the predicate as well as the 
subject of a judgment. The innovation would necessitate a complete 
change in the system of logical notation, and was destined (so, at 
least, its author claimed) to reform the entire science, to reduce 
propositions to equations, to simplify the doctrine of conversion, and 
to abolish the figured syllogism.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Psychology</b>. Hamilton divides the phenomena of the mind into 
<i>cognitions, feelings</i>, and <i>conative phenomena</i> (volitions 
and desires). The cognitive states are subdivided according as they are 
referred to one or other of the cognitive faculties; namely, the 
<i>presentative</i>, the <i>conservative</i>, the <i>reproductive</i>, 
the <i>representative</i>, the <i>elaborative</i>, and the 
<i>regulative</i>.<p>

The <i>presentative faculty</i> includes external and internal 
perception, the former being synonymous with consciousness of states of 
the not-self, and the latter with self-consciousness, or consciousness 
of states of self. For, whether it is question of external or of 
internal perception, all that we perceive is the phenomenon; so that 
our knowledge of matter, as well as our knowledge of mind, is confined 
to phenomenal states. "Our whole knowledge of mind and matter," 
Hamilton writes, "is thus only <i>relative</i>; of existence, 
absolutely and in itself, we know nothing."<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> In this sense Hamilton 
is a <i>relativist</i>, -- a relativist, however, of a class altogether 
different from that to which 
 <!--
SIR WILLIAM HAMILTON 599 
 --><A NAME="p599"></a>
 are assigned those who, like Protagoras, held that man is the measure 
of all things.<p>

The qualities of external reality as perceived by us are reduced to 
three classes, -- <i>primary, secundo-primary</i>, and 
<i>secondary</i>, -- according as the knowledge element or the feeling 
element predominates in the perception.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> Of these qualities we have 
an immediate, or presentative, not a mediate, or representative, 
knowledge. Hamilton is, therefore, an advocate of <i>natural 
realism</i>, of which he says Reid is the first champion in modern 
times.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The <i>conservative</i> and <i>reproductive faculties</i> include the 
retentive and resuscitative functions of memory. The resuscitative 
faculty is governed by the <i>laws of association</i>, to which 
Hamilton devoted special attention.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The <i>representative faculty</i>, or <i>imagination</i>, is defined as 
the power of representing in consciousness and of keeping before the 
mind the knowledge presented, retained, and reproduced.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The <i>elaborative</i> faculty is the faculty of comparison. It 
includes generalization (simple apprehension), judgment, and reasoning.<p>

The <i>regulative</i> faculty is what the ancients called 
<i>intellect</i>, and what Reid and Stewart designated as common sense. 
The phenomena with which it is concerned are not data of experience, 
but rather the <i>native cognitions of the mind</i>, which are the 
conditions of all experience.<p>

Passing over the nomology of the mind, we next come to the questions of 
ontology, that is to the inferences drawn from the study of the mind.<p>

<b>Ontology</b>. Since we know only the relations of things, since 
relativity in this sense is a quality of all human knowledge, it  
 <!--
600 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p600"></a>
 follows that we cannot know the unconditioned. "Conditional limitation 
is the fundamental law of the possibility of thought. . . . To know is 
to condition."<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> <i>The unconditioned</i>, however, is not in itself a 
contradiction; its inconceivableness does not preclude the possibility 
of its existence. It is inconceivable as a concept, and its existence 
is unknowable so far as reason, intuition, and experience go. Hamilton, 
however, admitting that "our faculties are weak, not deceitful,"<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup>
holds that a supernatural revelation of the Absolute supplements our 
ordinary knowledge of it.<p>

With regard to <i>self</i> and <i>not-self</i> Hamilton, while holding 
that the doctrine of relativity applies to these objects of knowledge, 
-- that self and not-self are per se unknowable as to their substance, 
-- concedes that our mental experience reveals self as a unity amid 
successive changes, and that our experience of the external world 
warrants us in representing it as a reality which is permanent as to 
the quantum of existence, although the forms of existence are 
constantly changing.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup><p>

It is scarcely necessary to point out here the <i>ambiguity of the term 
"relativity"</i> as applied to human knowledge. Between the 
propositions "We know only the relations of things" and "We know the 
related thing only in so far as it is related to us" there is a vast 
difference, -- a difference to which the difference between agnosticism 
and theism is ultimately reduced.<p>

Hamilton explains the universal belief in <i>causation</i> by the 
inability of the human mind to think anything except under the 
conditions of space and time.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Hamilton brought to bear on the study of 
philosophy an erudition less common than it ought to have been among 
British philosophers in the early part of the nineteenth century. It 
was by encouraging historical research in connection with the study of 
philosophy, and by fostering a spirit 
 <!--
MANSEL AND FERRIER 601 
 --><A NAME="p601"></a>
 of scholarship rather than by stimulating constructive effort, that 
his influence as a writer and teacher was most widely felt. Exception 
must, however, be made in favor of his doctrine of relativity, which 
may be said to be the philosophical basis of modern agnosticism, 
although it is quite certain that Hamilton never intended that his 
criticism of rational knowledge should become a criticism of belief.<p>

<b>Henry Longueville Mansel</b> (1820-1871) was the first to apply the 
doctrine of relativity to the defense of religion. In the <i>Limits of 
Religious Thought</i> (Bampton Lecture, 1858) and the <i>Philosophy of 
the Conditioned</i> (1866) he endeavors to refute rationalism by 
showing, in conformity with Hamilton's principles, that the only 
knowledge of the unconditioned which the human mind can acquire is 
"negative," and that in matters of religious belief a scientific system 
is impossible. He insists that the difficulty of believing arises not 
from revelation but from <i>the inability of reason to form a positive 
concept of God</i>,<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> and concludes that reason must be corrected and 
supplemented by faith. The constructive aspect of Mansel's system was, 
however, neglected; its destructive aspect was promptly seized upon and 
converted into a justification of <i>agnosticism</i>.<p>

<b>James Frederick Ferrier</b> (1808-1864), author of the <i>Institutes 
of Metaphysic</i> (1854), is sometimes reckoned among the members of 
the Scottish school. His attitude was, however, one of antagonism to 
the doctrines of that school, and especially to the identification of 
metaphysics with psychology, which was, as we have seen, a tenet common 
to all the Scottish philosophers. He divided philosophy into 
<i>epistemology</i> (the theory of knowing), <i>agnoiology</i> (the 
theory of ignorance), and <i>ontology</i> (the theory of being).<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup><p>
