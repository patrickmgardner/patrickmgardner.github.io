76 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
--><A NAME="p76"></a>
<h2 align="center">SECOND PERIOD -- SOCRATES AND THE SOCRATIC SCHOOLS</h2><p>

In this second period of its history Greek philosophy reaches its 
highest development. It is a comparatively short period, being 
comprised within the life spans of the three men who so dominated the 
philosophic thought of their age that their names, rather than the 
names of schools or cities, are used to mark off the three subdivisions 
into which the study of the period naturally falls. We shall, 
therefore, consider<p>

<ul>
<li>I. <i>Socrates and the imperfectly Socratic Schools.</i>
<li>II. <i>Plato and the Academics.</i>
<li>III. <i>Aristotle and the Peripatetics.</i>
</ul><p>

The problem with which this period had to deal had already been 
formulated by the Sophists, -- how to save the intellectual and moral 
life of the nation, which was threatened by materialism and scepticism. 
Socrates answered by determining the conditions of intellectual 
knowledge, and by laying deep the scientific foundation of ethics. 
Plato, with keener insight and more comprehensive understanding, 
developed the Socratic doctrine of concepts into a system of 
metaphysics, gigantic in its proportions, but lacking in that solidity 
of foundation which characterized the Aristotelian structure. Aristotle 
carried the Socratic idea to its highest perfection, and, by 
prosecuting a vigorous and systematic study of nature, supplied what 
was defective in Plato's metaphysical scheme. The central problem was 
always the same; the answer was also the same, though in different 
degrees of organic development, -- <i>concept, Idea, essence</i>. The 
view adopted was neither entirely subjective nor entirely objective, 
 -- the concept doctrine, which was the first and simplest answer, being 
the typical formula for the union of subject and object, of self and 
not-self.

<hr align="center"><p><a name="Chapter"></a>

<h3 align="center">CHAPTER VII<br>
SOCRATES</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. The story of Socrates' life, as far as it is known, is 
soon told. He was born at Athens in the year 469 B.C. He was the son of 
Sophroniscus, a sculptor, and of Phaenarete, a midwife. Of his early 
years little is recorded. We are told that he was trained in the 
profession of his father. For education, we must suppose that he 
received merely the usual course of instruction in music, geometry, and 
gymnastics, so that, when he calls himself a pupil of Prodicus and 
Aspasia, he is to be understood as speaking of friends from whom he 
learned by personal intercourse rather than of teachers in the stricter 
sense of the word. Indeed, in Xenophon's <i>Symposium</i> he styles 
himself a self-taught philosopher, <b>autourgos t&ecirc;s 
philosophias</b>. It is, therefore, impossible to say from what source 
he derived his knowledge of the doctrines of Parmenides, Heraclitus, 
Anaxagoras, and the Atomists.<p>

The gods<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> had revealed to Socrates that Athens was to be the scene of 
his labors and that his special mission in life was the moral and 
intellectual improvement of himself and others. Accordingly, after some 
years spent in his father's workshop, he devoted himself to this 
mission with all the enthusiasm of an unusually ardent nature: from a 
sculptor of statues he became a teacher who strove to shape the souls 
of men. So devoted was he to this task of teaching the Athenians that 
he never became a candidate for public office,<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> and, with the exception 
of the military campaigns, which led him as far as Potidaea and Delium, 
and a public festival which required his presence outside the city, 
nothing could induce him to go beyond the walls of Athens.<p>

In fulfilling his task as teacher, he did not imitate the Sophists, who 
were at that time the recognized public teachers in Greece. He would 
neither accept remuneration for his lessons nor would he give a 
systematic course of instruction, preferring to hold familiar converse 
with his pupils and professing a willingness to learn as well as to 
teach. He taught in the market place, in the gymnasium, in the 
workshop, -- wherever he found men willing to listen, -- and once he 
had secured an audience, he held it with that extraordinary eloquence 
which is so graphically described in the Symposium of Plato.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> He 
discarded all the arts and airs of the Sophists; in appearance, 
 <!--
78 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p78"></a>
 manners, and dress, as well as in the studied plainness of his 
language, he stood in sharp contrast to the elegance and foppishness of 
his rivals. Yet, by what seems to us a singular instance of vindictive 
misrepresentation, he was held up to scorn by Aristophanes in the 
Clouds as a Sophist, a teacher of what was merely a semblance of 
wisdom, and as a vain, pompous, and overbearing man. Socrates' private 
means must have been scanty, and the mere mention of his wife, 
Xanthippe, recalls the misery and degradation which must have been his 
lot in domestic life.<p>

The narrative of his trial, condemnation, and death is one of the most 
dramatic in all literature. The closing scene as described in the 
<i>Phaedo</i> is unequaled for pathos and sublimity by any other page 
that even Plato wrote. His death occurred in the year 399 B.C.<p>

<b>Character</b>. The personality of Socrates has impressed itself more 
deeply on the history of philosophy than has that of any other 
philosopher. The picture which Xenophon draws of him is almost ideally 
perfect. "No one ever heard or saw anything wrong in Socrates; so pious 
was he that he never did anything without first consulting the gods; so 
just that he never injured any one in the least; so master of himself 
that he never preferred pleasure to goodness; so sensible that he never 
erred in his choice between what was better and what was worse. In a 
word, he was of all men the best and the happiest."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Plato's account 
agrees with this. Socrates, however, -- "Saint" Socrates as he is 
sometimes called, -- was not without his traducers. There was in his 
character a certain incongruity (an <b>atopia</b> his admirers called 
it), an inconsistency between the external and the internal man, 
together with a certain uncouthness of speech and manner, which was 
entirely un-Greek. These peculiarities, while they endeared him to his 
friends, made him many enemies, and established a tradition that in 
later times developed into a tissue of accusations, of which 
coarseness, arrogance, profligacy, and impiety are but a few. Although 
it is true that these charges are devoid of even the slightest 
foundation, we must remember that in the age of Pericles the Athenians 
were by no means a race of superior beings, and even Socrates despite 
his higher moral ideals did not rise far above his contemporaries in 
point of moral conduct.<p>

<b>The Socratic Divinity</b>. Socrates, as is well known, often spoke 
of a divine sign, or a heavenly voice, which in the great crises of his 
life communicated to him advice and guidance from above. Many are the 
suggestions as to what he meant by such allusions. Lewes<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> reminds us 
that while Socrates, Plato, and Xenophon never speak of a genius or a 
demon, they 
 <!--
THE SOCRATIC DIVINITY 79 
 --><A NAME="p79"></a>
 frequently make mention of a demonic something, -- <b>daimonion 
ti</b>, which Cicero translates <i>divinum quoddam</i>.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> Socrates was 
a profoundly religious man, and it is quite natural that he should 
designate as "divine" the voice of conscience, or, as Hermann <sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> 
suggests, the inner voice of individual tact, which restrained him not 
merely from what was morally wrong, but also (as in the case of his 
refusal to defend himself) from whatever was unwise or imprudent. This 
voice was probably nothing more than a vague feeling for which he 
himself could not account, a warning coming from the unexplored depths 
of his own inner consciousness.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Socrates, so far as we know, never wrote anything; it 
is certain that he committed none of his doctrines to writing. We are 
obliged, therefore, to rely for our knowledge of his teaching on the 
accounts given by Plato and Xenophon. Aristotle, also, speaks of the 
doctrines of Socrates; but he tells us nothing which may not be found 
in the writings of the two disciples who stood in so close personal 
relation with their master. It has been said that Plato and Xenophon 
present different views of Socrates, and to a certain extent the 
statement is correct; but the views which they present are pictures 
which supplement rather than contradict each other. Xenophon wrote his 
<i>Memorabilia</i> as a defense of Socrates. Being of a practical turn 
of mind, and wholly unable to appreciate the speculative side of 
Socrates' teaching, he attached undue importance to the ethical 
doctrines of his master. Plato, with deeper insight into the 
philosophical phase of Socrates' mind, draws a picture of the sage 
which fills in and perfects the sketch left us by Xenophon. It is well 
to remember, moreover, that the doctrines of Socrates were, of 
necessity, difficult to describe. The teaching of one who never wrote 
even an essay on philosophy must necessarily be lacking in the 
compactness and conciseness which are possible only in the written 
word.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

SOCRATES' PHILOSOPHY<p>

<b>General Character of Socrates' Teaching</b>. The Ionians and the 
Eleatics had shown, by their failure to account for things as they are, 
that no value is. to be attached either to sense-perception or to 
metaphysical knowledge arising from the notions of Being, Becoming, 
the One, the Many, etc. This was as clear 
 <!--
80 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p80"></a>
 to Socrates as it had been to the Sophists. But, whereas the Sophists 
had forthwith given up the search after truth, Socrates insisted that 
by reflecting on our own mental constitution we may learn to determine 
the conditions of knowledge, to form concepts as they ought to be 
formed, and by this means place the principles of conduct as well as 
the principles of knowledge on a solid scientific foundation. <i>Know 
thyself</i> (<b>gn&ocirc;thi seauton</b>): this is the sum of all 
philosophy. From the consideration of the objective world (nature) we 
must turn to the study of the subjective (self). Thus, philosophy "from 
heaven descended to the low-roofed house" of man.<p>

<b>Socratic Method</b>. The first lesson which self-knowledge teaches 
is our own ignorance. If, therefore, we are to arrive at a knowledge 
through concepts, that is, at a knowledge of things, not in their 
surface qualities, but in their unalterable natures, we must have 
recourse to the dialogue; in other words, we must converse in order to 
learn. Thus, love of knowledge and the impulse to friendship are the 
same, and the blending of these two is what constitutes the peculiarity 
of the Socratic Eros.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The Socratic dialogue involves two processes, the one negative and the 
other positive.<p>

1. <i>The negative stage</i>. Socrates approached his interlocutor as 
if seeking for knowledge. Assuming a humble attitude, he asked a 
question about some commonplace thing; from the answer he drew material 
for another question, until at last by dint of questioning he extorted 
from his victim a confession of ignorance. By reason of the pretended 
deference which, during the process of interrogation, Socrates paid to 
the superior intelligence of his pupil, the process came to be known as 
Socratic irony.<p>

2. <i>The positive stage</i>. Socrates now proceeded, by another series 
of questions, to add together, as we say, particular instances, until 
finally the pupil was made to arrive inductively 
 <!--
SOCRATIC METHOD 
 --><A NAME="_"></a>
 at a concept, that is, at an idea of the unalterable nature of the 
subject discussed. In the <i>Memorabilia</i><sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> we find examples of the 
use of this inductive process, which Socrates himself named 
<i>maieutic</i> -- in reference to the profession of his mother --
because its object was to bring into life the truth already existing in 
the mind of the pupil.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The whole method is <i>heuristic</i>, or a method of finding. It is an 
inductive process resulting in a definition. "Two things," says 
Aristotle,<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> "are justly ascribed to Socrates, induction and 
definition," and the importance of the introduction of these processes 
cannot be overestimated.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> For the knowledge of things in their 
changeable qualities Socrates would have us substitute the knowledge of 
things in their unalterable natures, or essences. Pre-Socratic 
philosophers had, indeed, hinted at a distinction between
 sense-knowledge and rational knowledge, or had even gone so far as to 
insist that such a distinction must be recognized as the beginning of 
philosophy. Nevertheless, men continued to appeal to the senses, to 
rely on sense-impressions, or, at most, to group sense-impressions in 
composite images such as the poet and the rhetorician employ. It was 
Socrates who, by his heuristic method, first showed that
 sense-impressions and all uncritical generalizations need to be tested 
and controlled by criticism, because they are incomplete and exhibit 
merely what is accidental in the object. It was he too who, by the same 
method, first showed that, if our sense-impressions are grouped, not 
according to the exigencies of poetry and rhetoric, but according to 
the requirements of logic, if they are articulated into a concept 
representing the unalterable nature of the object, human knowledge will 
be built on a lasting foundation.<p>

<b>Contents of Socratic Teaching</b>. Socrates applied his heuristic 
method to the questions of man's dignity and destiny. 
 <!--
82 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
  --><A NAME="p82"></a><p>

1. <i>Physical questions</i> were not discussed by Socrates. For this 
statement we have the explicit testimony of Xenophon and Aristotle. And 
yet, as we shall see, Socrates studied adaptation in nature. The truth 
seems to be that he was opposed not so much to physical studies as to 
the way in which physical questions were being and had been discussed. 
It must, however, be added that whatever interest Socrates took in such 
matters was always subservient to his interest in man.<p>

2. <i>Theology</i>. As far as we can gather from our authorities, 
Socrates seems to have adopted from Anaxagoras the notion of an 
Intelligent Cause (<b>Nous</b>), but, going farther than Anaxagoras had 
gone, he proved the existence of God from the fact that there is 
adaptation in living organisms. In the course of his argument he 
formulated a principle which has served as major premise in every 
<i>teleological argument</i> since his time: "Whatever exists for a 
useful purpose must be the work of an intelligence."<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> We find, 
moreover, traces of the argument from efficient cause. If man possesses 
intelligence, He from whom the universe proceeds must also possess 
intelligence.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> Nevertheless, Socrates accepted the current mythology, 
at least so far as external worship is concerned, advising in a
 well-known passage<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> that in this matter each one should conform to 
the custom of his own city.<p>

3. <i>Immortality</i>. Although Plato represents Socrates as 
considering dilemmatically "either death ends all things, or it does 
not,"<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> there can be no doubt as to Socrates' <i>belief</i> in the 
immortality of the human soul. It may be that he thought the 
dialectical proof of the doctrine to be beyond the power of the human 
mind; but the depth of his personal conviction cannot for a moment be 
questioned.<p>

4. <i>Ethics</i>. If Socrates taught men how to think, it was with the 
ultimate intention of teaching them how to live. All his philosophy 
culminates in his ethical doctrine. In fact, he was 
 <!--
SOCRATES' ETHICS 83  
 --><A NAME="p83"></a>
 the first not only to establish a scientific connection between 
speculation and ethical philosophy, but also to give an analysis 
of happiness and virtue which was capable of further systematic 
development.<p>

The supreme good of man is <i>happiness</i>, and by happiness Socrates 
meant not a mere <b>eutuchia</b>, which depends on external conditions 
and accidents of fortune, but an <b>eupraxia</b>, a well-being which is 
conditioned by good action. To attain this, man must become godlike in 
his independence of all external needs: he must become abstemious, for 
moderation is the corner stone of all virtue.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> Yet Socrates, as is 
evident from the dialogues of Plato, did not carry this doctrine of 
moderation to the degree of asceticism. More important even than 
moderation is the cultivation of the mind. To be happy, one must build 
his happiness not on the perishable things of the external world, but 
on the enduring goods which are within us, on a mind free from care and 
devoted to the acquisition of knowledge.<p>

For <i>knowledge is virtue</i>. This is, perhaps, the most 
characteristic of all Socrates' ethical doctrines,  --  the 
identification of speculative insight with moral excellence. <b>(ho 
S&ocirc;krat&ecirc;s) epist&ecirc;mas &ocirc;et einai pasas tas 
aretas</b>.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> No man intentionally does wrong, he says, for that would 
be intentionally to make himself unhappy. Knowledge is, therefore, the 
only virtue and ignorance is the only vice. Yet when Socrates comes to 
speak of particular instances of virtue, he leaves the high level of 
virtue-knowledge and descends to commonplace utilitarianism or customary 
morality. In the dialogues of Xenophon he almost always bases his moral 
precepts on the motive of utility: we should endure privations because 
the hardy man is more healthy; we should be modest because the 
punishment of the boastful is swift and sure; and so with the other 
virtues. This inconsistency is a defect which mars all the beauty of 
the Socratic system of ethics. 
 <!--
84 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p84"></a><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The philosophy of Socrates is best judged 
in the light of the influence which it exercised on the Platonic and 
Aristotelian systems of thought. His pupils, Plato and Aristotle, are 
the best proofs of Socrates' title to a place among the world's 
greatest teachers. Looking at his philosophy as a body of doctrine, we 
find that it contains (1) a reform in philosophic method -- the 
foundation of <i>induction</i>; (2) the first systematic inquiry the 
conditions of knowledge -- the foundation of <i>epistemology</i>; (3) 
the first system of ethics -- the foundation of <i>moral science</i>.<p>

Important as were these contributions to philosophy, more important was 
the influence which Socrates exerted by his life and character. He 
appeared in an age that was tired of vain speculation and pretended 
wisdom, among a people then as always more apt to be impressed with 
concrete presentation than with abstract reasoning, and, by his many 
virtues, as well as by his whole-souled devotion to truth, he convinced 
his contemporaries that knowledge is attainable, and that a higher and 
nobler life may be reached through a systematic study of the human 
mind. By living the life of an ideal philosopher he taught his 
countrymen to respect philosophy and to devote themselves to the 
pursuit of wisdom.<p>
