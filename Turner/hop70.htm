ITALIAN PHILOSOPHY<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

The founder of modern Italian philosophy is <b>Giovanni Battista 
Vico</b> (1668-1744), who, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, 
opposed the Cartesian method in philosophy and anticipated the 
<i>historical method</i> subsequently developed by Herder and Hegel. 
The mind, Vico teaches, can know only that which it can produce through 
its own activity; this activity is manifested in the historical 
development of civilization, the basis of which is Divine Providence. 
Human experience is, therefore, to be interpreted and rendered 
reasonable by referring it to the principles by which human nature has 
developed itself. In this development Vico distinguishes three stages: 
the <i>divine</i> (theocracy), the <i>heroic</i> (aristocracy), and the 
<i>human</i> (monarchy and democracy).<p>

In the movement of philosophic thought in Italy during the nineteenth 
century we may distinguish<p>

1. <b>Sensism and Empiricism</b>, of which the chief representatives 
are <b>Gioja</b> (1767-1829) and <b>Romagnosi</b> (1761-1835). 
These represent the Italian phase of the <i>sensistic philosophy of 
Condillac</i>, which, as we have seen, was dominant in France at the 
beginning of the nineteenth century.<p>

2. <b>Criticism</b>, of which the chief exponent is <b>Pasquale 
Galuppi</b> (1770-1846), who, while he assumes the immediate 
consciousness of the ego and the objectivity of sensation, reduces the 
intellectual element of thought to the synthetic relations 
(<i>rapporti</i>) of identity and difference, which are <i>a priori</i> 
products of the activity of the mind. In this, as well as in his 
emphatic assertion of the supremacy of moral obligation, Galuppi 
betrays the influence of Kant.

3. <b>Idealism</b>. The principal representative of idealism in Italy 
during the nineteenth century is Antonio Rosmini.<p>

ROSMINI<p>

<b>Life</b>. Antonio Rosmini-Serbati (1797-1855), the founder of 
Italian idealism, was born at Rovereto near Trent. In 1821 he entered 
the priesthood, and in 1828 founded the Institute of Charity, a 
religious society devoted to corporal, intellectual, and spiritual 
works of charity. In 1848 he went to Rome as special envoy of King 
Charles Albert; in the same year he became minister of instruction in 
the papal cabinet and was considered a candidate for the honors of the 
cardinalate. After the murder of Rossi (November, 1848) and the flight 
of Pius IX to Gaeta, changes in the policy of the pontifical court 
necessitated Rosmini's retirement. The last years of his life he spent 
at Stresa, near Lago Maggiore, where he had established a house of his 
order. There he led a quiet, studious life, edifying his brethren by 
his many virtues, and especially by the humility with which he received 
the condemnation of two of his works.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> He died in 1855.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The treatises in which Rosmini sets forth his 
metaphysical and psychological doctrines are <i>Teodicea</i> (1828), 
<i>Nuovo Saggio sull' Origine delle Idee</i> (1830), <i>Il Rinnovamento 
della Filosofia in Italia</i> (1836), <i>Antropologia</i> (1838), 
<i>Psicologia</i> (1846-1850), <i>Introduzione alla Filosofia</i> 
(1850), <i>La Logica</i> (5853), and <i>Teosofia</i> (1859). For full 
bibliographical list, <i>cf.</i> Davidson, <i>Rosmini's Philosophical 
System</i> (London, 1882).<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p> 

DOCTRINES<p>

Rosmini distinguishes the matter and the form of thought, the matter 
being sensation, and the form being the pure intellectual element. Now 
the matter of thought is multiple and diverse; the form, however, is 
one and self-identical, namely, the intuition of <i>Being in its 
transcendental ideality (l' essere ideale, ente universale)</i>. This 
intuition cannot result from experience, 
 <!--
632 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p632"></a>
 abstraction, or reflection: it is an innate concept and is of divine 
origin. Rosmini does not, it is true, expressly identify this idea of 
Being with the idea of God; for he teaches that <i>l' essere 
ideale</i>, although it is necessary, eternal, immutable, and identical 
for all minds, is a principle of knowledge, not a principle of 
existence.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Nevertheless, Rosmini cannot consistently maintain a 
distinction between <i>l' essere ideale</i> and God; because, although 
he maintains that God is both real and ideal (<i>l' essere
 reale-ideale</i>), he teaches that the reality of <i>l' essere 
iniziale</i> is a reality of pure indetermination. Indeed, in the 
<i>Teosofia</i>, all attempts at discriminating between <i>l' essere 
iniziale</i> and God are abandoned, and we are told that the former is 
something of the Word, which the Father distinguishes from the Word by 
a distinction which is merely logical (<i>distingue non realmente ma 
secondo la ragione dal Verbo</i>).<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> There is, therefore, in Rosmini's 
teaching only too much foundation for the almost unanimous verdict of 
his critics, that he was an ontologist<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> and by implication a 
pantheist.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In his account of the soul and its faculties, Rosmini teaches that the 
soul is not the substantial form of the body, but is united to it by a 
fundamental sensibility (<i>sentimento fondamentale</i>), that the 
essence of the soul is sensibility (<i>sentimento primitivo e 
sostanziale</i>), and that the soul becomes intelligent by the 
intuition of Being in its ideality (<i>essere ideale</i>).<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup>

<b>Ontologism</b>. <b>Vincenzo Gioberti</b> (1801-1852), who was a 
priest, a revolutionary leader, a statesman, and a controversialist 
(<i>Il Gesuita Moderno</i>, his best known controversial work, appeared 
in 1846), opposed the philosophy of Rosmini and formulated a system of 
his own, which is characterized by ontologism. He begins as a 
metaphysician rather than as a psychologist; he does not examine the 
contents of the mind, nor does he subject mental processes to analysis; 
he simply <i>postulates a primitive intuition</i> with which 
constructive synthesis begins. The content of this intuition is not 
Being in its ideality nor God, but God as creating, -- <i>Ens creat 
existentias</i>.<p>

"Through the intuition of this principle, the mind is in possession at 
once of the real and the ideal; for the first member of the formula, 
Being, contains the object, the absolute idea as well as the absolute 
substance and cause; the second, existences, gives the organic 
multiplicity of contingent substances and causes and relative ideas; 
the third, the creative act, expresses the relation existing between 
the absolute and the relative, . . . the production of real and ideal 
existences from the Absolute."<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> The <i>primum philosophicum</i> is, 
therefore, an organic truth containing in itself the <i>primum 
ontologicum</i> and the <i>primum psychologicum</i>. Gioberti's 
posthumous works (published by Massari, 1856-1859) exhibit a more 
advanced form of ontologism than that which has just been sketched.<p>

Among the later ontologists may be reckoned <b>Terenzio Mamiani</b> 
(1800-1885), who during the later half of the century associated his 
name and influence with the rationalistic movement represented by 
<b>Ferri</b> (1826-1895), <b>Ferrari</b> (1812-1876), and <b>Ausonio 
Franchi</b> (C. Bonavino) (1821-1895).<p>

<b>Positivism</b>. The principles of positivism were defended by the 
three rationalistic writers just mentioned and taught systematically by 
<b>Roberto Ardig&ograve;</b> (born 1828), <b>Andrea Angiulli</b> (1837-
1890), and others. 
 <!--

<b>Hegelianism</b>. The most distinguished of the Italian 
representatives of Hegelianism, <b>Augusto Vera</b> (1813-1885), was by 
education and long residence a Frenchman rather than an Italian. His 
works, some of which were composed in French, others in Italian, and 
others in English, are devoted to the interpretation and exposition of 
Hegel's philosophy.<p>

<b>Scholasticism</b>. The history of Scholastic philosophy in Italy 
during the nineteenth century will be given in the chapter devoted to 
the history of Catholic philosophy.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The systems which have just been outlined 
do not, with the exception of Rosmini's idealism, exhibit any sustained 
effort at independent construction. The most distinctive trait of 
modern Italian philosophy is its tendency to treat religious and 
political philosophy in the controversial or polemical spirit, rather 
than in the spirit of constructive synthesis, -- a tendency easily 
traceable to the influence of the events which determined the political 
history of Italy during the nineteenth century.<p>

that the idea of Being must be God, since it possesses divine 
attributes, Rosmini writes: "Every <i>real</i> being must be God or 
creature, but not so every <i>ideal</i> being. The idea of <i>Being</i> 
abstracted from God's reality is neither God nor creature, it is 
something <i>sui generis</i>, an appurtenance of God." Rosmini's
