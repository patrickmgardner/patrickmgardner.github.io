CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY</h3><p>

<b>Germany</b>. In Germany there seems to be at the present time a 
tendency towards reconstruction on a realistic basis. Darwin's 
evolutionary hypothesis and the law of the conservation of energy, 
which was formulated and proved by <b>Robert Mayer</b> (1814-1878), 
demanded a reconstruction of the philosophy of nature, and in answer to 
this demand there appeared various systems.<p>

(a) <i>Materialism</i>, represented by <b>Karl Vogt</b> (1817-1895), 
author of <i>Vorlesungen &uuml;ber den Menschen, etc.</i> (1863), 
<b>Jakob Moleschott</b> (1822-1893), author of <i>Der Kreislauf des 
Lebens</i> (1852), <b>Ludwig B&uuml;chner</b>, author of <i>Kraft und 
Stoff</i> (1855), and <b>Ernst Haeckel</b>, author of 
<i>Nat&uuml;rliche Sch&ouml;pfungsgeschichte</i> (1868), <i>Die Welt 
r&auml;tsel</i> (1899). With these is contrasted <b>Albert Lange</b> 
(1828-1875), the historian of materialism, who, while maintaining 
that materialism is indispensable as a method of investigation, teaches 
that it is untenable as a system.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--

(b) <i>Neo-Criticism</i>. The Neo-Criticists, deploring the effects of 
the "deluge of romanticism," return to the principle of criticism, and 
in their idealistic reconstruction give fuller scope to the scientific 
view than their predecessors succeeded in doing. Chief among the
 Neo-Criticists are <b>Rudolf Hermann Lotze</b> (1817-1881), author of 
<i>Metaphysik</i> (1840), <i>Medizinische Psychologie</i> (1852), 
<i>Mikrokosmos</i> (1856-1864), etc., and <b>Eugen D&uuml;hring</b>, 
author of <i>Nat&uuml;rliche Dialektik</i> (1865), etc. Lotze's 
philosophy may be said to combine Herbartian with Fichtean and Hegelian 
metaphysics. D&uuml;hring devotes special attention to epistemology, 
emphasizing the antithesis between the ideal continuity of thought and 
the fragmentary character of given empirical reality. The most 
enthusiastic of the Neo-Kantians is <b>Friedrich Paulsen</b>,<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> who 
defines philosophy as "the sum of all scientific knowledge." He is 
equally opposed to the intellectualism of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel, 
who "absolutely ignore experience and pay it no regard whatever," and 
to the materialism of Vogt, Buchner, etc., who overlook the essential 
distinction between the psychical and the physical order of reality. He 
adopts a theory of metaphysical and psychological <i>parallelism
 (pan-psychism)</i>, and insists, as Rousseau and Schopenhauer 
insisted, on the recognition of the demands of the heart and the 
supremacy of will over intellect.<p>

In the philosophy of <b>Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg</b> (1802-1872) 
the realistic reaction appears in the form of a <i>revived 
Aristotelianism</i>. His principal works are <i>Logische 
Untersuchungen</i> (1840), <i>Naturrecht auf dem Grunde der Ethik</i> 
(1860), and <i>Historische Beitr&auml;ge zur Philosophie</i> (1846).<p>

(c) <i>Specialization of Philosophy</i>. A third phase of the rcalistic 
reaction appears in the empirical philosophy, which, in obedience to 
the principle of the division of labor, is tending towards 
specialization of philosophical inquiry. Under this head may be 
included the physiologist, <b>E. H. Weber</b>; the psychologists 
 <!--
646 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p646"></a>
 <b>Fechner</b> and <b>Wundt</b>, founders of the science of psycho-
physics,<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> <b>Brentano</b>, <b>Stumpf</b>; the educationalists and 
folk-psychologists, <b>Steinthal</b>, <b>Lazarus</b>; the logician 
<b>Sigwart</b>; the epistemologists, <b>E. L. Fischer</b> and 
<b>Hermann Schwarz</b>. To these may be added <b>Tonnies, Daring, 
Ziegler</b>, who devote special attention to ethical problems; 
<b>Hermann, Karl Fischer</b>, students of the philosophy of history; 
and <b>Zeller, J. E. Erdmann, Kuno Fischer, Falckenberg, Windelband, 
Otto Willmann</b>, and <b>Clemens Baeumker</b>, historians of 
philosophy.<p>

<b>Avenarius</b> (1843-1896) represents the critical philosophy of 
experience (empirio-criticism).<p>

<b>France</b>. In France the current of contemporary thought seems to 
have set towards a <i>neo-criticism</i>, which aims at 
<i>spiritualistic reconstruction</i>: "After passing," writes M. 
Fouill&eacute;e, "through a period in which the intellect was in revolt 
against the heart, we are entering into one in which the heart is in 
revolt against the intellect."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> <b>Vacherot</b> (1809-1897), author 
of <i>La m&eacute;taphysique et la science</i> (1858), represents the 
form of idealism prevalent in France about the middle of the nineteenth 
century, -- the reaction against positivism. More recently, 
<b>Renouvier, Secr&eacute;tan, Pillon, Boutroux</b>, represent a 
critical philosophy,<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> which is tending towards partial dogmatism 
(existence of the Infinite, freedom of the will, etc.).<p>

<b>Paul Janet</b> (1823-1899), an eclectic spiritualist, represents the 
continuation of the philosophy of Cousin and Jonifroy, while <b>Alfred 
Fouill&eacute;e</b> defends a system of monism based on the concept of 
<i>id&eacute;es forces</i>, -- a monism which combines the 
intellectualism of Hegel with the voluntarism of Schopenhauer.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--
CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY 647  
 --><A NAME="p647"></a><p>

<b>M. L'Abb&eacute; Piat</b>, one of the most distinguished 
representatives of constructive spiritualism in France at the present 
time, expounds and defends the essential doctrines of Thomistic 
philosophy. He is to be reckoned among the most enlightened and 
successful of the Neo-Thomists.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Among the psychologists, <b>Ribot, Delboeuf, Paulhan</b>, represent a 
modified form of phenomenalism, while <b>Bernheim, Charcot</b> (1825-
1893), <b>Binet, Luys</b>, and <b>Pierre Janet</b> represent the French 
school of pathological psychology, and psycho-physics.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The socialism of <b>Fourier</b> (1772-1837), <b>Proudhon</b>
 (1809-1865), etc., gave, towards the middle of the nineteenth century, 
an impetus to sociological inquiry which has produced the contemporary 
French school of sociology. The chief contributors to the literature of 
sociology are M. <b>Tarde</b> and <b>Ren&eacute; Worms</b>.<p>

<b>England</b>. In England the Neo-Hegelian movement has been gaining 
strength during the last quarter of a century. In addition to <b>J. H. 
Stirling, T. H. Green, John Caird, Edward Caird</b>,<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> of whom mention 
has already been made, <b>William Wallace, F. H. Bradley, David G. 
Ritchie, Andrew Seth, John McTaggart</b>, and others exhibit different 
phases of contemporary interest in transcendental criticism and 
construction on an idealistic basis.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> "The springs of  
 <!--
648 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHV 
 --><A NAME="p648"></a>
 this movement," Professor Wallace observes, "lie in the natural and 
national revulsion of English habits of mind. Slowly, but at length, 
the storms of the great European revolution found their way to our 
intellectual world, and shook Church and State, society and literature. 
. . . The insularity which had secluded and narrowed the British mind 
since the middle of the eighteenth century needed something deeper and 
stronger than French 'ideology' to bring it abreast of the requirements 
of the age. Whatever may be the drawbacks of transcendentalism, they 
are virtues when set beside the vulgar ideals of enlightenment by 
superficialization."<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Alexander Campbell Fraser</b>,<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> in his <i>Philosophy of 
Theism</i>, advocates the necessity of philosophic faith. <b>Arthur 
James Balfour</b>, in his <i>Defence of Philosophic Doubt</i> (1879) and 
his <i>Foundations of Belief</i> (1895), opposes both realism and 
idealism and advocates the principle of authority.<p>

In the special departments of philosophic study there have appeared in 
recent times the logicians, <b>George Boole</b> (1815-1864), <b>W. 
Stanley Jevons</b> (1835-1882), <b>John Veitch, J. N. Keynes, Thomas 
Fowler</b>; the moral philosophers, <b>Henry Sidgwick</b><sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> (1838-
1900), <b>James Martineau</b> (1805-1900), <b>Henry Calderwood, Leslie 
Stephen</b>; the psychologists, <b>James Sully, C. Lloyd Morgan</b>, 
and <b>W. B. Carpenter</b> (1813-1885); and the pathologists, <b>Henry 
Maudsley, C. A. Mercier</b>.<p>

<b>Italy</b>. In Italy the official philosophy, whether Hegelian, 
positivistic, phenomenalistic, or Rosminian, manifests a spirit of 
bitter <i>hostility towards religion</i> in the positive form of 
Catholicism. So far the Neo-Scholastic movement is apparently without 
influence on the centers of secular education.<p>

Mention must here be made of the Italian school of <i>criminology</i> 
and <i>psychiatry</i> represented by <b>Lombroso</b> and 
<b>Mantegazza</b>.  
 <!--

<b>America</b>. In America the Neo-Hegelian movement has found 
distinguished representatives in <b>John Watson</b> and <b>W. T. 
Harris</b>.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> The future course of philosophic thought in this country 
is, however, likely to be influenced less by the Neo-Hegelians than by 
the Neo-Voluntarists, who teach that "the ultimate test for us of what 
a truth means is the conduct it dictates or inspires," and that "the 
whole function of philosophy ought to be to find out what definite 
difference it will make to you and me at definite instants of our lives 
if this world-formula or that world-formula be the one which is true." 
This pragmatism may be said to interpret the meaning of conceptions by 
asking what difference they make in the matter of life, conduct, and 
activity experience; for the Cartesian, "Cogito, ergo sum," it 
substitutes "Ago, ergo sum." It was first proposed as a maxim by <b>C. 
S. Peirce</b>.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> Its chief representatives in this country are 
Professor <b>William James</b> of Harvard, and Professor <b>William 
Caldwell</b><sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> of Northwestern University. The latter contends that 
Professor James, while rightly appealing to pragmatism as a method, 
fails to carry the principle of voluntarism far enough. He suggests the 
adoption of a broader metaphysical principle, according to which 
reality should be defined as "that which sustains a more or less 
verifiable and determinable relation to our activity."<p>

In connection with this neo-voluntarism, or "new ethical" movement, 
mention must be made of Professor Josiah Royce<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
650 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p650"></a>
 of Harvard, who declares that "philosophy turns altogether upon trying 
what our various fundamental ideas mean," defines the individual to be 
that which is the <i>object of exclusive interest</i>, and in general 
adopts some non-rational standard, such as concrete experience 
(loyalty, love, interest) rather than elements constitutive of abstract 
thought-value, as the ultimate test of philosophic truth. "To be means 
simply to express, to embody the complete internal meaning of a certain 
absolute system of ideas. . . . Our theory of the nature of Meaning is 
to be founded upon a definition in terms of Will and Purpose."<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Mention must also be made of psychologists who, like Professor <b>J. M. 
Baldwin</b><sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> of Princeton, contend that all cognitive activity is at the 
same time emotional activity, and that intellectual development is a 
continual growth in motor accommodation and in practical 
inventiveness.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In the writings of Professor <b>John Dewey</b><sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> of the University of 
Chicago there is traceable the influence of the English Hegelians, 
especially that of Green. There is, however, a manifest tendency on the 
part of Dr. Dewey to modify the purely intellectual idealism of Green 
by recognizing the motor tendency of our ideas, and thus bringing 
idealism into closer relation to the determination of values. Professor 
<b>Frank Thilly</b><sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> of the University of Missouri has done good 
service to philosophy in America by his translations and by his able 
presentation of ethical problems. In the published works of Professor 
<b>G. T. Ladd</b><sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> the preponderant influence  
 <!--
PHILOSOPHY OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY 651 
 --><A NAME="p651"></a>
 seems to be that of Lotze. Indeed, between Lotze's treatment of the 
problem of values and the contemporary pragmatic notion of 
philosophical method there exists a similarity which is suggestive of 
causal dependence. For, just as in Lotze's teleological idealism, 
reality is referred not to a purely rational category but to worth or 
value, which is determined by the purpose of life, so also in the 
pragmatism with which so much of recent philosophical literature is 
imbued, "The <i>ultima ratio</i> of every creed, the <i>ultima 
ratio</i> of truth itself, is that it works."<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. When contrasted with the philosophy of the 
eighteenth century, the philosophy of the nineteenth century exhibits, 
in the first place, a spirit of constructive activity. The eighteenth 
century was largely destructive in its aim and tendency; the age of 
illumination, which terminated that century, drew a line of separation 
between the intellectual and the spiritual, between the scientific and 
the religio-aesthetic, between culture and belief, and placed the 
individual in sharp antithesis to the social order. It treated with 
levity, and often with contempt, every effort to harmonize these 
elements into a constructive system of thought. The nineteenth century, 
however, changed all this. Thoroughly in earnest with theism and the 
problems of theistic philosophy, it attempted to combine into a 
synthetic system the spiritual, the religious, and the aesthetic 
elements of human life, as well as the intellectual and scientific. It 
studied the relation between the individual and society from the point 
of view of organic unity and dependence, rather than from that of 
mechanical independence and natural conflict. Not that philosophy in 
the nineteenth century succeeded in effecting a complete and systematic 
unification of these various elements. The century which has just come 
to a close was happily alive to the importance and value of 
constructive effort; but it was unfortunately condemned to start its 
construction on the foundation which a previous age had 
 <!--
652 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p652"></a>
 laid. If, therefore, at the beginning of the twentieth century, a 
final philosophy seems as far from being attained as it seemed a 
hundred years ago, it is not because men have not striven, for they 
have striven earnestly, to find the true solution of the problems of 
philosophy; nor is it because they have neglected what their 
predecessors had too often underestimated, but because they could not 
break altogether with the past -- with the subjectivism, the 
psychological dualism, and the false sense of philosophic method which 
they had inherited from Descartes.<p>

Indeed, post-Kantian philosophy, the philosophy of the nineteenth 
century, exhibits in a high degree the subjectivism which is a 
characteristic of modern life. It is true that this trait is not 
always, and in all its aspects, a defect. For instance, while, as is 
well known, the beautiful and the spiritual in their objective phases 
played a far more important part in Greek life and in mediaeval life 
than they play in modern life, yet it is the modern world that, owing 
to its clearer consciousness of inner experience, first undertook to 
analyze the sentiment of the beautiful and the religious sentiment. The 
subjectivism of modern philosophy appears, too, in its fuller 
realization of the difficulty of the philosopher's task. No doubt the 
work of unifying all knowledge and formulating a rational explanation 
of the complex world revealed by modern science, is far more imposing 
than the problem which confronted Thales; but when due allowance is 
made for the greater complexity of the problems which confront modern 
philosophy, must it not be charged to the too great subjectivism of our 
age that while it has felt more intensely, thought more profoundly, and 
analyzed more acutely, it has accomplished less than any preceding age? 
As in the individual, so also in the race; too much questioning and too 
little active responsibility and practical realization of the problems 
of life lead inevitably to the despair of knowing anything. Must an era 
of reflection be an era of irresolution and hesitancy? The
 neo-voluntaristic movement of the present 
 <!--
CONCLUSION 653 
 --><A NAME="p653"></a>
 hour may be taken as an indication of the incompetency of "mere 
intellect" to explain all reality, and the importance which is at the 
present time attached to philosophic faith may be regarded as an 
assertion of the limitations of the analytic faculty and an affirmation 
of the need of constructive synthesis. Both these contemporary 
tendencies of thought may well meet in a common endeavor to restore a 
method which, uniting the objective with the subjective and making the 
supernatural continuous with the natural, would give free scope to 
reason within the limits of rational inquiry and leave at the same time 
ample room for the exercise of religious faith.<p>
