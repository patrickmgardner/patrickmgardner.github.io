PHILOSOPHY OF THE ROMANS<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

The Pythagoreans of Magna Graecia were the first to introduce greek 
philosophy into Italy. Pythagorean philosophy, however, never took deep 
root in Roman soil. Indeed, although Pythagorean speculation flourished 
in Italy as early as the sixth century, 
 <!--
190 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p190"></a>
 it was not until the beginning of the second century before Christ 
that Rome began to feel the power of Greek literature and Greek art, 
and it was about the same time that the influence of Greek philosophy 
was first felt. That the Romans did not accept without a struggle this 
imposition of a foreign culture is evident from the fact that in 161 
B.C. residence in Rome was, by a decree of the Senate, forbidden to 
philosophers and rhetoricians. Later, however, the conquest of Greece 
and the military expeditions of Pompey, Caesar, Antony, and Augustus 
broadened the minds of the Romans, rendered them susceptible to the 
beauty of Greek literature, and led to the inflow of Greek learning and 
to the establishment in Rome of the representative teachers of Greek 
philosophy. Cicero was, therefore, contrasting his own age with the 
more conservative past when he said: "Philosophia jacuit usque ad hanc 
aetatem."<p>

In accepting the philosophy of Greece, the Roman spirit asserted its 
practical tendency, selecting what was more easily assimilated, and 
modifying what it accepted, by imparting to it a more practical 
character. Thus it was the ethical philosophy of the Epicureans and 
Stoics and the Eclectic systems of later times, rather than the 
philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, that throve when transplanted to 
Roman soil.<p>

CICERO<p>

<b>Life</b>. Marcus Tullius Cicero is the best known representative of 
Roman Eclecticism. He was born at Arpinum 106 a.c. and died at Formiae
43 B.C. He had for teachers Phaedrus the Epicurean, Philo of Larissa, 
representing the New Academy, Diodotus the Stoic, and Antiochus, an 
exponent of the later Eclecticism of the Academy. In addition to the 
advantages to be derived from such a training, he possessed a 
knowledge, widely extended if not always accurate, of the philosophical 
literature of pre-Socratic and Socratic schools. He did not lay claim to 
any great independence as a philosopher, being willing, as he tells us, 
to take credit merely for the art with which he clothed Greek 
philosophy in Roman dress: "Verba 
 <!--
CICERO 191
 --><A NAME="p191"></a>
 tantum affero, quibus abundo."<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> In this self-appointed task Cicero 
is not ways successful, his account of the doctrines of the
 pre-Socratic philosophers being especially inaccurate.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Cicero's principal philosophical works are: 
<i>Academica</i>, or <i>Quaestiones Academicae, Tusculanae 
Disputationes, De Finibus, De Natura Deorum, De Officiis, De 
Divinatione</i> (unfinished), <i>De Republica</i> (of which about a 
third part was discovered and published in 1822 by Cardinal Mai), 
<i>Paradoxa Stoicorum, De Senectute, De Amicitia, De Fato</i>.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>General Idea of Philosophy</b>. Cicero describes himself<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> as a 
member of the New Academy. His philosophy is, in point of fact, an 
Eclecticism based on Scepticism. So impressed was he with the war of 
philosophical systems that he despaired of arriving at certainty and was 
content to accept probability as the guide of conduct. But whenever he 
discovered that philosophical schools could be reconciled, he strove to 
coordinate the common elements into a system loosely connected, as is 
every system Eclecticism.<p>

<b>Theory of Knowledge</b>. All our knowledge rests, in ultimate 
analysis, on immediate certainty, which is variously called <i>notiones 
innatae, notiones nobis insitae</i>, or, since immediate knowledge is 
common to all men, <i>consensus gentium</i>. In the <i>Tusculan 
Disputations</i>, for example, Cicero speaks of the principles of 
morality as innate; "sunt enim ingeniis nostris semina innata 
virtutum."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> These elements of knowledge are antecedent to all 
experience. We have, therefore, in Cicero's theory of knowledge, the 
first explicit expression of the doctrine of <i>innate ideas</i>.<p>

<b>Theological Notions</b>. Cicero, in his proof of the existence God, 
falls back on the <i>innate idea of God</i>, the presence of which in 
the minds of all men is proved by the universality the belief in a 
Supreme Being. He brings forward also the 
 <!--
192 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p192"></a>
 <i>teleological argument</i> in its Stoic form, contending that the 
Epicurean doctrine of chance is as absurd as would be the expectation 
that the twenty-one letters of the Latin alphabet could, by being 
poured out at random, produce the <i>Annals</i> of Ennius.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> He 
attaches great importance to the doctrine of Providence and of the 
divine government of the universe.<p>

<b>Anthropology</b>. With the belief in God is intimately associated 
the conviction of the dignity of man. The soul is of supernatural 
origin: "Animorum nulla in terris origo inveniri potest."<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> It is 
different from matter. Still, Cicero does not altogether exclude the 
Stoic idea of the soul as a firelike substance. He teaches that <i>the 
soul is immortal</i>, having recourse to the Platonic arguments as well 
as to inner conviction and universal consent. In his incomplete 
treatise <i>De Fato</i> he proves the <i>freedom of the will</i> by 
similar arguments.<p>

<b>Ethics</b>. In this portion of his philosophy Cicero is a follower 
of the Eclectic Stoics. On the one hand he rejects the Epicurean 
doctrine that pleasure is the highest good; but when, on the other 
hand, he adopts the Stoic doctrine of virtue, he is too much of a man 
of the world not to recognize that the Stoic morality is too exalted or 
too severe to be applied to everyday life. Accordingly, he modifies the 
severity of Stoicism by introducing the Platonic and Aristotelian 
teaching, that honors, wealth, etc., are goods, although subordinate to 
virtue, which is the chief good.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> He teaches that while virtue is 
sufficient for vita beata, external goods also are necessary for 
<i>vita beatissima</i>, -- a distinction borrowed from Antiochus of 
Ascalon. The morally good (honestum) is that which is intrinsically 
praiseworthy.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Cicero, as has been said, laid no claim to 
originality as a philosopher. He merely collected and assimilated the 
philosophical doctrines of the Greeks. He is the truest representative 
of the Eclecticism of this period.

Chief among Cicero's followers was <b>Varro</b> (116-27 B.C.), whom 
Seneca calls <i>doctissimus Romanorum</i>. He was more famous as a 
scholar than as an independent philosopher. Like Cicero, he was a Stoic 
and an Eclectic. Unlike the other philosophers of Rome, <b>Titus 
Lucretius Carus</b> (95-51 B.C.) is not an Eclectic. In his poem, <i>De 
Rerum Natura</i>, he adheres closely to the docline of Epicurus.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Under the first emperors, the school of the <i>Sextians</i> acquired 
considerable importance. The founder, <b>Quintus Sextius</b>, was born 
about 70 B.C. He was succeded by his son, under whose leadership the 
school came to include among its adherents <b>Sotion, Celsus</b>, and 
<b>Fabianus</b> . Soon, however, it dwindled into insignificance, so that 
in Seneca's time it had entirely ceased to exist. From the few scattered 
utterances of the Sextians which have come down to us and from the 
account given by Seneca, it is evident that the teaching of the school 
was Stoicism tinged one or two points of doctrine with Pythagoreanism.<p>

In the first century of our era there flourished in Rome an important 
branch of the Stoic school. It included <b>Lucius Annaeus Cornutus</b> 
(died A.D. 68), <b>Aulus Persius Flaccus</b> (A.D. 34-62), <b>Lucius 
Annaeus Seneca</b>, and his nephew <b>Marcus Annaeus Lucanus</b> (A.D. 
39-65). <b>Seneca</b>, the most important of these, was born about the 
beginning the Christian era at Corduba in Spain. He owed his 
philosophical training to the Sextians and other Stoics. In A.D. 65, he 
committed suicide by order of Nero, whose counselor he had been. His 
writings possess great value as sources for the history of the Stoic 
school. He agrees in all essentials with the early Stoics, although in 
many points of detail he follows the later representatives of the 
school, who modified the doctrines Zeno and Chrysippus in more than one 
respect.<p>

Towards the end of the first century <b>Musonius Rufus</b> was 
distinguished in Rome as a teacher of Stoic philosophy. He 
 <!--
194 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p194"></a>
 confined his teaching, however, more strictly than Seneca had done, to 
the ethical application of Stoicism. The most important of his 
disciples was <b>Epictetus</b>, the philosopher-slave, a Phrygian, who 
lived in Rome from the time of Nero to that of Trajan (A.D. 117). The 
works, entitled <i><b>Diatribai</b></i> and <i><b>Egcheiridion</b></i>, 
contain the discourses of Epictetus as written down by his disciple, 
Arrian. Epictetus defines philosophy to consist in learning what to 
avoid and what to desire. In accordance with this definition, he 
develops a system of practical philosophy, teaching, with the Stoics, 
that happiness is to be found in independence of external things.<p>

Closely allied to Epictetus is the emperor-philosopher, <b>Marcus 
Aurelius Antoninus</b> (A.D. 121-180). His work, entitled <i><b>ta eis 
heauton</b></i>, consists of aphorisms written down in the form of 
memoranda, or notes for personal guidance. His teaching agrees with 
that of the Stoics. He insists more than did the other Stoics on the 
kinship of man to God. In order to secure happiness, man must loose his 
soul from the bonds of interest in things external and, retiring within 
himself, learn to become like to God by becoming resigned to the will 
of God, and by loving all his fellow-men, excluding neither the weak 
and erring nor the ungrateful and hostile.<p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. The philosophy of the Romans reflects the essential 
traits of the Roman character. It is practical in its aims; it 
subordinates theoretical inquiry to problems of conduct, thus depriving 
itself of the power of systematic development, and condemning itself to 
the circumscribed task of assimilating and applying what the Greek 
masters had taught.<p>

<b>Character of Greek Philosophy</b>. We have now reached a point 
whence we may look back over the whole course of the development of 
Greek speculation before we turn to the study of a new era, in which 
Greek civilization and Greek philosophy came into contact with the 
religions of the East and were influenced by them. 
 <!--
CHARACTER OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY 195  
 --><A NAME="p195"></a><p>

The civilization of Greece had a character peculiar to itself. The 
"national spirit" (to use a Hegelian phrase) which dominated the life 
of the nation determined the character of the literature, the art, the 
political institutions as well as the philosophy of the country. What, 
then, is the character which the national spirit of Greece imparted to 
Greek philosophy? The answer to this question is best reached by a 
comparison of Greek with Oriental philosophy on the one hand, and with 
mediaeval and modern philosophy on the other.<p>

Compared with Oriental philosophy, the philosophy of Greece is 
remarkable, in the first place, for its manifold completeness. It 
contained in germ all the systems that were to appear in subsequent 
times; scarcely a problem of speculative or practical philosophy failed 
to receive attention at the hands of the philosophers of Greece. 
Oriental speculation, on the contrary, being centered round a few 
problems of physics, theology, and ethics, fell far short of Hellenic 
speculation in breadth and completeness. In the next place, while 
Oriental thought was stagnant, producing throughout long ages of 
inquiry not more than a few schools, and exhibiting in its development 
a certain languid sameness, the course of thought in Greece was free 
and active, producing a variety of systems of speculation and 
manifesting all the freedom, force, and supple pliancy of the Greek 
mind. Finally, the comparison of Greek with Oriental philosophy 
furnishes an instance of the essential racial difference between Greece 
and the Orient. The East was ruled by metaphor, the Oriental mind being 
strangely averse to the direct and natural mode of expression. The 
Greek mind, on the contrary, abhorred all intricacy and metaphorical 
tortuousness; it went towards the truth with a directness, and 
formulated conclusions with a boldness, which may appear childish in 
the case of a Thales or an Anaximander, but which, nevertheless, must 
command our admiration when we come to reflect how far Thales and 
Anaximander have advanced beyond the mythological 
 <!--
196 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p196"></a>
 concept of the universe. Completeness, productive activity, and 
directness are, therefore, the qualities which Greek philosophy 
exhibits when compared with the philosophy of the East.<p>

The comparison of Greek with modern philosophy suggests at the very 
outset the trait which is most distinctive of Greek civilization. Greek 
life, Greek art, Greek literature, and Greek religion were objective. 
Modern civilization, on the contrary, is more subjective than 
objective. To this general contrast of Greek life and modern life the 
philosophy of Greece and modern philosophy offer no exception. At 
first, in the period of beginnings, Greek philosophy was entirely 
objective; in the second period, the period of greatest perfection, the 
subjective element in philosophical speculation received due attention; 
it was only in the third period, when philosophy began to degenerate, 
that the subjective element became unduly prominent. In Greek 
philosophy, at the period of its greatest perfection, in its Golden 
Age, we find the union of the subjective and objective elements, the 
belief in the continuity of the spiritual with the material, -- a 
continuity which is not incompatible with the distinction between 
matter and spirit. We find, too, the conviction that the inquiry into 
the conditions of knowledge does not destroy, but rather confirms the 
trustworthiness of our impressions of the external world. Modern 
philosophy, on the contrary, starts out with the supposition that there 
is an original antithesis between object and subject, between matter 
and mind, between the impression of sense and the verdict of pure 
reason. The Greek, even in his most abstract idealism, was never so 
abstract as the modern transcendentalist, and in his philosophical 
realism he always knew how to stop short of the crudeness of 
materialism. Modern speculation has tended towards centralizing 
philosophy on self the Greek always considered that other-self, nature, 
is the chief subject of inquiry. In a word, Greek philosophy, at least 
in the Golden Age of its development, was more true to nature than 
modern speculation is. 
 <!--
CHARACTER OF GREEK PHILOSOPHY 197  
 --><A NAME="p197"></a><p>

This fidelity to nature is, however, a source of weakness as well as of 
strength. The <i>spirit of naturalness</i> prevented the Greek from 
looking beyond nature for his ideal in art; it prevented him in his 
philosophy from carrying his theological peculations far enough to 
determine, for example, the notion of personality. It was left for 
Christian speculation to complete the work of Plato and Aristotle and, 
by laboring in the Greek spirit of completeness and manifoldness, to 
determine, as it did in the Golden Age of mediaeval philosophy, that 
faith and reason are at once distinct and continuous. In this way, 
Christian philosophy carried the Greek fidelity to nature into (the 
region of the supernatural, refusing to admit an antagonism between 
these two phases of reality -- the world of reason and the world of 
faith -- just as the Greeks had refused to admit the antithesis 
between mind and matter, which is the postulate of modern philosophy.<p>

Before we come to the philosophy of the Christian era, it is necessary 
to outline the rise and course of thought in the Alexandrian school; 
for it was in Alexandria that the ancient world first came into contact 
with the civilization of the new era.<p>
