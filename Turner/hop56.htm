SPINOZA</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. Baruch (Benedict) Spinoza was born in 1632 at Amsterdam 
where his parents, who were Portuguese Jews, had sought refuge from 
religious persecution. He received his early education in the Jewish 
academy at Amsterdam; later, he studied natural science under the 
tuition of a free-thinking physician named Van den Ende, and was 
initiated into the mysteries of Talmudic literature and philosophy by 
the Rabbi Morteira. In 1656 he was solemnly excommunicated by the 
Synagogue on account of his heterodox views and obliged to leave his 
native city. After a few years spent at Rhynsburg and Voorburg, he 
repaired, in 1669, to The Hague, where he earned his livelihood by 
polishing lenses. In 1673 he declined the offer of a professorship at 
Heidelberg, preferring the quiet and independence of the humble life 
which he had elected to lead. He chose poverty for his lot, and when 
he died, in 1677, his worldly possessions were barely sufficient to pay 
a few trivial debts which he had contracted during his illness.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The principal philosophical works of Spinoza are <i>De 
intellectus Emendatione, Ethica Ordine Geometrica Demonstrata Tractatus 
Politicus, Tractatus Theologico-politicus, Principia Philosophiae 
Cartesianae</i> (in geometrical form), <i>Cogitata Metaphysica</i>, and 
a <i>Short Treatise on God and Man</i> (written in Dutch). The best 
edition of Spinoza's works is that of Van Vloten and Land (The Hague, 
1882-1883, in 2 vols; reprinted, 1895, in 3 vols.), Pollock's 
<i>Spinoza, his Life and Philosophy</i> (London, 1880), and Principal 
Caird's <i>Spinoza</i> (<i>Blackwood's Philosophical Classics</i>, 
Edinburgh and Philadelphia, 1888), are excellent introductions to the 
philosophy of Spinoza.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> The <i>Ethica</i> was translated by White 
(London, 1883) and by Elwes (London, 1883-1884).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Spinoza's Idea of Philosophy</b>. It will be impossible to arrive at 
a definite idea of Spinoza's system or to reconcile the widely 
divergent interpretations of his philosophy, unless we first inquire 
 <!--
SPINOZA'S DEFINITION OF SUBSTANCE 467
 --><A NAME="p467"></a>
 into <i>the motive which actuated him</i> in his philosophical 
speculations, and try to discover the point of view from which he 
looked out on the world of life and thought. In the treatise <i>De 
Intellectus Emendatione</i> he gives us a kind of mental autobiography 
and tells us that his aim in philosophy is to seek the knowledge which 
makes men happy. His thought, therefore, is not set in motion by a 
problem of causality; nor is he interested in the question of the value 
of knowledge; but he is troubled at the unrest, of which the whole 
world is full, and he approaches the problems of philosophy in the 
ethical rather than in the scientific spirit, with the hope of leading 
his reader to look upon things in that aspect of them which shall 
conduce to greater spiritual and moral perfection. This is the 
significance of the title <i>Ethica</i>, by which he designated his 
great metaphysical treatise.<p>

To this <i>ethical aim</i> of his philosophy Spinoza subordinated 
everything else, even logical consistency and systematic coherency, 
causing to converge in one channel of thought Cartesianism, the 
pantheism of Bruno and Maimonides, and the mysticism of the
 Neo-Platonists and the cabalistic philosophers.<p>

<b>Starting Point; Definitions</b>. Spinoza's method is even more 
formally and technically mathematical than that of Descartes. The 
<i>Ethica</i> starts with definitions and axioms, and proceeds, by a 
process of syllogistic proof, to the establishment of propositions and 
corollaries.<p>

Spinoza defines <i>substance</i> as follows (def. III):<p>

<blockquote>
Per substantiam intelligo id quod in se est et per se concipitur: hoc 
est id cujus conceptus non indiget conceptu alterius rei a quo formari 
debeat.  
</blockquote><p>

And here, whatever view we may take as to the preponderance of 
Descartes' influence on Spinoza's mind, we cannot fail to observe that 
Spinoza's definition is but an interpretation of the ambiguous words in 
which Descartes defined substance: "Res quae ita existit, ut nulla alia 
re indigeat ad existendum." 
 <!--
468 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p468"></a><p>

Spinoza next proceeds to define <i>attribute</i>: "Per attributum 
intelligo id quod intellectus de substantia percipit tamquam ejusdem 
essentiam constituens" (def. IV). In the following definition (def. V) 
he describes mode: "Per modum intelligo substantiae affectiones, sive 
id quod in alio est, per quod etiam concipitur."<p>

<b>Substance</b>. Substance, attribute, and mode are the cardinal ideas 
in Spinoza's system of thought. Having defined them, therefore, he 
proceeds to show from the definitions:<p>

(a) That substance is one, infinite (prop. VIII), and indivisible 
(prop. XII).<p>

(b) That the one substance is God (prop. XIV). Now, God is defined 
(def. VI) as "Ens absolute infinitum, hoc est substantia constans 
infinitis attributis quorum unumquodque aeternam et infinitam essentiam 
exprimit." God is, then, an infinity of infinities; and, although an 
attribute, such as thought, or a mode, such as space, may be infinite, 
God alone is infinite in the infinity of his infinite attributes: they 
are infinite in one respect; he is infinite in all respects.<p>

<b>The Existence of God</b> is a necessary truth. In proof of this 
Spinoza advances the argument that God is substance, and substance must 
exist (prop. VII); for, not depending on anything else for its 
existence, it must cause itself, and therefore its essence must contain 
existence. In the second place, Spinoza (prop. XI) advances in proof of 
the existence of God an argument of which the following is the major 
premise: "Id necessario existit cujus nulla ratio vel causa datur quin 
impedit quominus existat." He then proceeds to argue that neither in 
the Divine Nature nor outside it is there any cause which could prevent 
the existence of God. The argument, as is evident, is guilty of the 
fallacy of passing from the order of ideas to the order of existence 
and merely proves the self-evident truth that if God exists, existence 
is a necessary attribute of the Divinity. Thirdly, Spinoza advances the 
following proof of the existence of God:
<!--
SPINOZA'S DOCTRINE OF SUBSTANCE 469
--><p>

<blockquote>
Posse non existere impotentia est, et, contra, posse existere potentia 
est (ut per se notum). Si itaque id quod jam necessario existit non 
nisi entia finita sunt, sunt ergo entia finita potentiora Ente absolute 
infinito. Atqui hoc (ut per se notum) absurdum est. Ergo vel nihil 
existit, vel Ens absolute infinitum necessario etiam existit. Atqui nos 
vel in nobis vel in alio quod necessario existit existimus. Ergo Ens 
absolute infinitum, hoc est (per def. VI) Deus, necessario existit.  
</blockquote><p>

In a scholion appended to this argument Spinoza, after calling 
attention to the apparently <i>a posteriori</i> form of the proof, 
remarks that in reality we do not argue from the existence of the 
finite to that of the infinite, that the conviction that God exists is 
based, not on the reality of the finite, but rather on the unreality, 
that is, on the imperfection, of all finite being. For, the more 
perfect a substance is, the more reality it possesses.<p>

<b>God is the Only Substance</b> (prop. XIV). Whatever is, is in God 
(prop. XV). It follows (prop. XVIII) that God is the immanent, not the 
transient, cause of all finite existence. It remains, therefore, for us 
to find in His unity that from which the differences of things are 
derived. This Spinoza attempts to do by means of the doctrine of 
attributes and modes.<p>

<b>Attributes of the Divine Substance</b>. The first determination of 
the infinite is by means of the attributes thought and extension. God 
is, indeed, an infinity of attributes; thought and extension are merely 
the two attributes under which the human mind is capable of 
representing Him. Instead, therefore, of Descartes' doctrine of the 
antithesis of the substance of mind to the substance of matter, we have 
the doctrine of one substance conceived under the antithetical 
attributes, thought and extension. For thought is merely one way of 
looking at God, and extension another; so that when I say <i>Deus est 
res cogitans</i> and <i>Deus est res extensa</i>, I am speaking of one 
and the same reality conceived in two different ways. The attributes, 
therefore, are not ways in which God determines Himself, but rather 
ways in which we determine Him,<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> and consequently the first attempt  
 <!--
470 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p470"></a>
 to find in the one the reason of the difference of the many is a 
failure. Indeed, Spinoza, if he were consistent, should have ended 
where he began, namely, at the definition of the one substance, and 
never have even attempted to derive the many from the one. Not 
deterred, however, by his first failure, Spinoza in his doctrine of 
modes renews the attempt to find a derivation of the finite from the 
infinite.<p>

<b>Modes of the Divine Substance</b>. The <i>attributes</i> were never, 
it seems, intended to mean finite being; for the character of 
independence (<i>per se concipi</i>) belongs to attribute, as it does 
to substance; but the <i>mode</i>, which can neither exist nor be 
conceived without substance (def. V), is surely finite, and here, if 
anywhere, we shall find the derivation of the finite from the infinite. 
For modes are, apparently, the countless parts into which the divine 
substance is sundered, the numberless billows which the ocean of 
eternal being casts up from its unfathomed depths.<p>

It is only in so far as God is determined to particular modes of being 
that He can be said to cause them. My body is caused by God inasmuch as 
it is a determination of Him; so, too, is my soul; so also are the 
various objects in the world around me. When, therefore, I ask, Are 
these modes identical with God? Am I God? I must answer that I am not 
God, for He is infinite and I am determined to this particular mode; 
but take away the determination of my mode of being, and I am God. In 
this sense we are <i>diminished Gods</i>. There are, therefore, two 
ways of viewing concrete finite things: first, as they are determined 
in time and space; and secondly, <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i>, that 
is, prescinding from all determination and looking at things merely as 
flowing necessarily from the divine substance.<p>

(a) We are now in a position to ask, <i>Is Spinoza a pantheist?</i> for 
the answer to this question will depend on the answer to this other 
question, Does Spinoza hold that finite things, as such, exist at all, 
that the modes have any existence apart from the 
 <!--
SPINOZA'S DOCTRINE OF MODES 471 
 --><A NAME="p471"></a>
 substance, that they determine the substance in the sense of a real 
determination? Spinoza<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> expressly teaches that <i>nothing proceeds 
from the infinite except the infinite</i>. Are the modes then infinite, 
since they come from the infinite? He answers that the modes come from 
God <i>inasmuch as (quatenus)</i> God is modified by finite modes, and 
may, therefore, be finite. This, however, is merely a subterfuge. The 
real answer is given when, on the ground that all determination is 
negation, all limit is not-being, Spinoza finally denies that the mode 
is real. The senses, it is true, present the world to us as consisting 
of finite beings really determined and distinct from one another and 
from the infinite; yet, if we view things <i>sub specie 
aeternitatis</i> and reflect that <i>all determination is negation</i>, 
then all distinction and all finiteness disappear, and we find that we 
have returned to the starting point, to the assertion, namely, that God 
is one and all is God. We may, indeed, distinguish between <i>natura 
naturans</i>, which is substance absolutely devoid of determination -- 
the indivisible one -- and <i>natura naturata</i>, which is substance 
infinitely modified and determined to an infinity of modes of being. 
But the distinction dissolves when we reflect that determination is 
negation, and that consequently the sum of all determinations is equal 
to nothing. We may therefore maintain the formula: <i>substance = God = 
nature</i>.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

It is clear, now, that the mode is as unreal as the attribute, and that 
substance evades all attempts at differentiation and determination. We 
can see how things lead up to substance, but we cannot see how they are 
derived from it. The substance, which is the central concept in 
Spinoza's system of thought, has been compared to the lion's den, 
whither many tracks lead, but whence none can be seen to return.<p>

(b) <i>The self-maintaining impulse</i>. Spinoza once more renews the 
attempt to derive the finite from the infinite, when<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> he describes the 
finite as only partly negative (<i>ex parte negatia</i>). 
 <!--
472 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p472"></a>
 There is, then, in the finite a positive element which, when we come 
to examine it, we find to be a self-maintaining impulse, an effort 
(<i>conatus</i>), by which it seeks to preserve its existence. in 
<i>Ethica</i>, III, 6, this impulse is said to be <i>the essence of 
finite being</i>. But here, once more, when we ask how this positive 
element is related to the substance, Spinoza is obliged to answer that 
it is a determination of God.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> We are, therefore, thrown back on the 
monism with which we started: there is no being but God.<p>

(c) <i>Description of the infinite</i>. Abandoning now all attempt at 
deriving the many from the one, let us inquire with Spinoza into the 
nature of the one substance. We must not expect to define it; for to 
define is to determine. We may, however, describe it by predicating 
terms of it analogously, as the schoolmen would say. It is, for 
example, a cause, not in the sense in which fire is a cause of heat, 
but rather in the sense in which the blackboard may be said to be the 
cause of the figures which limit, or determine, portions of its 
surface. The one substance may be said to be eternal, in the sense that 
its essence involves existence, or, to use Spinoza's peculiar 
phraseology, in the sense that it is the cause of itself. But what 
surprises us most in Spinoza's description of the one substance, is the 
assertion that it possesses neither intellect nor will, these being 
determinations belonging to <i>natura naturata</i>.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> It is evident, 
therefore, that the infinite is a geometrical rather than a dynamic 
infinite, that there is in it no principle of freedom or finality, that 
all things proceed from it by necessary and immutable law, just as the 
properties of a triangle (to use Spinoza's favorite illustration) 
proceed from the nature of the triangle. God is not a self-determining, 
self-integrating spirit, but an inert, impersonal substance.<p>

<b>Philosophy of the Finite</b>. The first determinations of substance 
are, as we have seen, mind and matter, or substance conceived as 
thinking and substance conceived as extended. 
 <!--
SPINOZA'S DOCTRINE OF INFINITE MODES 
 --><A NAME="_"></a>
 These attributes, although antithetical and therefore exclusive of 
interaction, are arranged in a certain parallelism, so that every mode 
of substance has its thought aspect and its extension aspect. For 
example, the idea of a circle, and the circle itself are the thought 
aspect and the extension aspect of one and the same mode of substance. 
To this <i>parallelism</i> we shall return later on. Before taking up 
the philosophy of mind and the philosophy of matter it is necessary to 
speak of the infinite modes.<p>

(a) The <i>infinite modes</i> are introduced in order to fill up the 
gap between God and finite modes: as modes, they are finite; as 
infinite modes, they belong to the sphere of the infinite. These 
infinite modes<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> are either modifications of the absolute nature of 
some attribute or modifications of an attribute already modified, but 
so modified as to be eternal and infinite. When asked for examples, 
Spinoza<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> answers that to the first class belongs infinite intellect 
as an infinite mode of thought, and motion and rest as infinite 
modifications of extension; while to the second class belongs the form 
of the whole universe (<i>facies totius universi</i>) which, though it 
varies in an infinity of ways, is always the same.<p>

This final attempt at mediation between the infinite and the finite is, 
like all Spinoza's previous attempts in the same direction, a failure. 
For the modes must, in ultimate analysis, be either finite or infinite. 
The doctrine of infinite modes is, however, interesting by reason of 
its striking resemblance to the Neo-Platonic doctrine of the Logos, 
which was just such an illogical introduction of a something 
intermediate between the one and the many. Indeed, Spinoza himself was 
aware of the resemblance.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> The doctrine is also of interest as 
showing once more how Spinoza's speculative intuition realized the 
necessity of introducing into his system some <i>principle productive 
of differentiation and plurality</i>, -- a principle which, however, 
the logic of his system would not and could not admit. 
 <!--
474 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p474"></a><p>

From each of the infinite modes proceeds an infinity of finite modes; 
from infinite intellect proceed all finite minds, and from infinite 
extension proceed all finite bodies. We come, therefore, to the 
philosophy of body and mind.<p>

(b) <i>Philosophy of body</i>. Extension is infinite (1) because it is 
an attribute of God, and (2) because its development could be impeded 
neither by a mode of thought nor by a mode of extension; and whatever 
is finite is so because it is in some way impeded in its development. 
Extension is not only infinite, it is also one and continuous, because 
(and whatever problem Spinoza happens to be discussing, he always takes 
us back to this point) substance is one and continuous. There is, 
therefore, no substantial, but merely a modal divisibility of 
extension.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Extension is essentially active, not inert, as Descartes taught; for it 
is, as we have seen, an attribute of substance, and substance, although 
incapable of self-differentiation, is essentially and eternally active. 
Every extended mode of substance is, therefore, preceded by and 
followed by an infinite series of movements. Thus, for the mechanism of 
Descartes, Spinoza substitutes a dynamism of a peculiar kind, namely, a 
dynamism based on the eternal activity of the infinite substance, not 
on the activity of matter itself.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Particular bodies are systems of movements. The molecules of the living 
body, for instance, are constantly changing; yet the body remains the 
same because the same relation continues to exist between the molecules  
-- the set of movemenfs remains the same. But the living body is 
itself part of a larger system of movements, -- of the terrestrial 
planet, for instance, -- and this in turn forms part of a still larger 
system; so that the isolated individuality of any one body is an 
illusion of the imagination: a comprehensive view, that is an adequate 
knowledge of any particular body, reveals it to be but part of the 
universal system of movements. 
 <!--
SPINOZA'S PHILOSOPHY OF MIND 475 
 --><A NAME="p475"></a><p>

But whence comes the order in this cosmic system of movements? Whence 
the adaptation of organ to function and of individual to environment? 
Spinoza has already answered in general terms that in the geometrical 
process of the finite from the infinite there is no place for the 
concept of finality. So, too, in the philosophy of body, he teaches 
that the extension modes of substance proceed from substance <i>as 
extended</i> not <i>as thinking</i>. There can, therefore, be <i>no 
intended adaptation</i>. The processes of the cosmos proceed by an 
unconscious geometry, in the same way as the spider spins its web 
without any knowledge of the proportion and symmetry of figures. It is 
only by imagination that we distinguish objects, fancy them to be 
individual, group them in figures, and arrange them so as to produce 
beauty of form or color. This arrangement was not intended in the 
processes themselves; so that, if we see beauty and adaptation in the 
geometrical processes of nature, it is due to the illusions arising 
from the inadequacy of our knowledge.<p>

(c) <i>Philosophy of mind</i>. Spinoza's psychology is partly 
foreshadowed in his doctrine of substance. Thought, as an infinite 
attribute of the infinite substance is eternal and necessary; it is the 
thought <i>of</i> God <i>by</i> God. Minds (created minds, as we 
commonly call them) and ideas are modes of substance under the aspect 
of thought, just as bodies are modes of substance under the aspect of 
extension. The order and connection of ideas is already determined by 
the order and connection of extension modes: <i>idem est ordo idearum 
et ordo rerum</i>.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> To every thought mode corresponds an extension 
mode, and this <i>parallelism</i>, being universal, implies that 
everything thinks. Indeed, Spinoza openly teaches that animals, plants, 
and even inanimate objects think; for the essence of a thing is the 
self-maintaining impulse, and an impulse is a tendency 
(<i>conatus</i>), and tendency implies thought. Plant thought, however, 
and animal thought Spinoza confesses to be thought of a very 
rudimentary kind. 
 <!--
476 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p476"></a><p>

The human mind is, like every other mind, a mode of the divine 
substance. But what kind of mode? It is defined, in the first place, as 
the idea of the body.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> We commonly say that man is composed of body and 
soul. In reality man is substance, determined to that particular mode 
of extension which we call body, and to that particular mode of thought 
which is the idea of body, and which we call soul. Body and soul are, 
therefore one and the same thing conceived under the aspects of 
extension and of thought, respectively. It will be observed, however, 
that although Spinoza reduces the soul to an idea, he is far from 
maintaining with the phenomenalist that the soul has no substantial 
reality; for he maintains that the soul is a mode of the great reality 
which is the one substance. It will be observed also that since the 
soul is the idea of the body, or in other words the consciousness of 
the organic states of the body, the conclusion that we must be aware of 
everything which takes place in the body, and that consequently every 
man must be an adept in physiology, appears at first sight inevitable. 
Spinoza, wishing to ward against this <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of his 
definition, teaches that "the human mind does not involve an adequate 
knowledge of the parts of the body,"<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> and that "the ideas of the 
affections of the body, in so far as they are related only to the human 
mind, are not clear and distinct, but confused."<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The human mind is defined, in the second place, as <i>the idea of an 
idea (idea ideae or idea mentis)</i>.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> In other words, mind, after 
having been defined as <i>consciousness</i>, is now defined as
 <i>self-consciousness</i>. The second definition is supplementary of 
the first, and, like the first, defines mind with distinct reference to 
body. For, when we say that mind is the idea of an idea, we mean the 
idea of the idea of the body. Self-consciousness is consciousness of 
self as revealed by bodily states,<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> or the reflex consciousness of 
our perceptions of those states.  
 <!--
SPINOZA'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 477 
 --><A NAME="p477"></a><p>

Having defined mind, we next turn to the study of <i>knowledge</i>, 
which is the characteristic attitude of the mind towards things. In the 
first exercise of the mind, our knowledge is <i>inadequate, 
fragmentary</i>, and <i>confused</i>. The reason of this imperfection 
is the fact that at first our point of view is purely individual, the 
point of view of one who, being himself part of the world of reality, 
apprehends merely those portions of reality with which he comes in 
contact. The inadequacy of this kind of knowledge is increased by the 
tendency of the mind to form <i>fictitious universals</i>, such as 
"being," "man," etc., which are not a sign of the mind's strength, but 
rather of its weakness; that is to say, of its inability to keep 
impressions apart from each other when they reach a certain limit in 
number and complexity.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup><p>

From this imperfect and inadequate knowledge man must pass to perfect 
and adequate knowledge, <i>by abandoning the individual and partial 
point of view</i> and by rising above himself and finite conditions; 
for perfect and adequate knowledge is untroubled by finite conditions 
and by the peculiarities of individual temperament.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> In this 
development from inadequate to adequate knowledge, Spinoza 
distinguishes two stages:<p>

(alpha) <i>Reason (ratio)</i> is the knowledge of the laws or principles 
which are common to all bodies, and which determine, not their 
accidental, but their essential relations.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> This kind of knowledge is 
acquired not <i>immediately</i>, but by <i>deduction</i>. Arguing from 
effect to cause, we arrive at a knowledge of the permanent and 
essential properties of things and of their unalterable laws and 
natures, -- a knowledge which is superior to the imperfect 
individualistic knowledge, inasmuch as the latter reveals to us merely 
the illusory surface qualities of things. Studied from the point of 
view of reason, things assume a certain permanency, and consequently 
rational knowledge may be said to be a knowledge of things <i>sub 
quadam specie aeternitatis</i>. 
 <!--
478 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p478"></a><p>

Rational knowledge is, however, necessarily incomplete. It enables us 
to arrive at generic and specific concepts, -- partial unifications, 
 -- but it cannot lift us up to that point where knowledge is 
completely unified and all things are viewed <i>sub specie 
aeternitatis</i>. This point we reach by means of<p>

(beta) <i>Intuitive knowledge (scientia intuitiva)</i>. In this stage of 
development the mind, being farthest removed from the individual point 
of view, no longer proceeds inferentially from one part of reality to 
another, but taking a comprehensive intuitive view of all reality, 
apprehends all things in the light of the first principle (substance) 
and, looking at all things <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i>, sees all in 
God and God in all. From this point of view, space, time, difference 
are seen to disappear and to be swallowed up in the immensity of God. 
He who has reached this point "evolves all his ideas from that which 
represents the origin and source of all nature, so that that idea 
appears to be the source of all others"; he has arrived at the 
culminating point in the development of human knowledge.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup><p>

We may remark in this theory of development of knowledge: (1) that 
whereas Descartes was content with making <i>clearness</i> and 
<i>distinctness</i> of perception a criterion of truth, Spinoza 
requires that, in addition to clearness and distinctness, our knowledge 
possess also <i>adequacy</i>, or comprehensiveness; (2) that Spinoza 
maintains the power of the human mind to <i>comprehend</i> infinite 
substance, that is to know God adequately; (3) that error exists only 
where knowledge is confused and inadequate; that consequently the mind 
never errs if it views things <i>sub specie aeternitatis</i>, and that 
since it is the will which determines whether a man shall or shall not 
attain intuitive knowledge, will and not intellect is the source of 
error; (4) that the three stages of development of knowledge may be 
described as <i>sense-knowledge, scientific knowledge</i>, and 
<i>philosophical knowledge</i>. We must, however, always remember that 
Spinoza sets

 the practical above the theoretical, and that he considers the third to 
be the most perfect kind of knowledge, not because it implies greater 
speculative insight into the nature of things, but because it sets the 
soul at rest and, like the ecstatic knowledge of which the mystics 
speak, enables us to despise the unrest and worry caused by the 
untoward events of life. This consideration brings us to the study of 
the ethical problems, on which all Spinoza's philosophy converges.<p>

<b>The Moral Nature of Man</b>. We have seen that the essence of finite 
things is the <i>conatus existendi</i>, the self-maintaining impulse. 
In man, this self-realizing impulse accompanies each of the three 
stages of knowledge, assuming in each a different complexion. In the 
plane of confused knowledge it manifests itself as <i>emotions</i>; in 
the higher plane of rational knowledge it manifests itself as 
<i>will</i>; and in the highest plane, namely, that of intuitive 
knowledge, it manifests itself as the <i>intellectual love of God</i>, 
in which consists the blessed life of immortality.<p>

(a) Let us consider the mind in the state of confused knowledge. Its 
being is thought: it is a diminished God, a God repressed, as it were, 
by the modes which limit its thought on every side. Like every other 
finite being, it strives not only to maintain itself, but also to 
extend its being by breaking through the modes which hem it in. But, 
unlike other finite beings, <i>the mind is conscious of this 
effort</i>. It is conscious also of the modes which affect it through 
the body, and it knows whether such modes diminish or increase its 
power of thought. This consciousness is emotion. In the third 
definition of the third part of the <i>Ethica</i>, emotion is defined:<p>

<blockquote>
Per Affectum intelligo Corporis affectiones quibus ipsius Corporis 
agendi potentia augetur vel minuitur, juvatur vel coercetur, et simul 
harum affectionum ideas,  
</blockquote><p>

and in the eleventh proposition of the same part Spinoza proves that 
whatever increases or diminishes the body's power of action, 
 <!--
480 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p480"></a>
 increases or diminishes the mind's power of thought. <i>Emotion</i>, 
then, is the (obscure and inadequate) consciousness of a transition 
from a less to a greater, or from a greater to a less, power of body or 
mind.<p>

The fundamental emotion is <i>desire (cupiditas)</i>, which is perhaps 
more properly described as the mental prerequisite of all emotional 
activity ; for it is the self-maintaining impulse itself. When a mode 
of the body, such as the sight of a flower, increases the mind's 
activity, there results the emotion of <i>pleasure</i>, or <i>joy 
(laetitia)</i>; when, on the contrary, a mode of the body, such as the 
hearing of unwelcome news, diminishes the mind's activity, there 
results the emotion of <i>sadness (tristitia)</i>. <i>Love</i> is the 
idea of an external thing which is the cause of joy, and <i>hatred</i> 
is the idea of an external thing which is the cause of sadness. 
<i>Hope</i> is the fluttering (<i>inconstans</i>) joy, and <i>fear</i> 
the intermittent sadness arising from the idea of an event which is of 
doubtful occurrence. When the element of doubt is removed, hope becomes 
<i>security</i> and fear passes into <i>despair</i>. The emotional 
state called <i>gaudium</i> is joy arising from the remembrance of a 
certain event as past, while its opposite, <i>regret (conscientiae 
morsus)</i>, is sadness arising from the remembrance of a certain event 
which has occurred. Both these states imply a previous doubt as to 
whether the event to which they refer did or did not occur.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The emotions are associated by <i>contiguity, resemblance</i>, and 
<i>causation</i>. This portion of Spinoza's <i>Ethica</i> is replete 
with instances of acute psychological analysis. The greatest defect in 
his treatment of the emotions is the exclusion of all intellectual 
emotions, such as zeal, love of God, love of justice, love of country, 
etc.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The emotional life of man belongs, according to Spinoza, to the 
<i>condition of bondage</i>. As long as we continue to look on the 
modes of the finite world as they affect us through the 
 <!--
SPINOZA'S ETHICAL DOCTRINES 481 
 --><A NAME="p481"></a>
 modes of our own bodies, so long are we merely part of nature and 
subject to nature's inevitable laws. We may imagine that we are free, 
because we have no clear knowledge of the antecedents of the modes 
which affect us, but in reality every indistinct consciousness is 
itself physically determined, and we are no more free to act than the 
straw which floats down the river is free to turn and float against the 
current. In this condition of bondage man's moral life has not properly 
begun at all; for in this condition there is no right or wrong, but 
only pleasure or pain. Man's moral life begins in the stage of rational 
knowledge, in which the emotions give place to will.<p>

(b) In the <i>second stage of knowledge</i> we possess adequate instead 
of inadequate ideas. Taking a broader view and contemplating the vast 
order of the universe and its eternal laws, we see that the objects of 
our love and aversion are really parts of the complex totality ruled by 
the inexorable laws of nature, and the vehemence of our passions 
appears to us, as it really is, no more reasonable than the child's 
anger at the stone which has hurt it.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> Reason can no more be moved by 
pleasure or pain, by love or hatred of any finite cause of our 
emotions, than it can love or hate a triangle because the latter 
possesses three angles which are equal to two right angles. Thus the 
mind, when it has arrived at the plane of rational knowledge, having 
lifted itself above the cloudland of emotional life, having risen above 
the storm of passion, is no longer buffeted by every wind of feeling, 
or constrained by pleasure and pain, -- in a word, it passes from the 
state of bondage to the <i>state of freedom</i>. There is a rational 
element in every passion, and when, having acquired an adequate idea of 
the passion, we recognize that rational element, blind impulse gives 
way to deliberate pursuit or avoidance. Remark that in the stage of 
rational knowledge this rational element is not yet located in God, but 
merely in the <i>common properties</i> of things or in <i>universal 
law</i>. The 
 <!--
482 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p482"></a>
 perfection of freedom and the final location of all the objects of 
will in God Himself, is attained by means of intuitive knowledge.<p>

It is somewhat surprising to find that Spinoza describes the moral 
emancipation of man as a process of intellectual development, without 
distinct reference to will, which is the proper subject of moral 
excellence. The explanation is to be found in the fact that Spinoza 
identifies will with intellect. "Will and understanding," he says, "are 
one and the same."<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> Intelligence contains in itself that free 
voluntary activity which we are accustomed to regard as the exclusive 
function of will; for <i>good</i> or <i>evil</i> means whatever helps 
or hinders our power of thought.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup><p>

It is of great importance to note that freedom, as understood by 
Spinoza, is, even in the sense of free understanding rather than of 
free will, incompatible with his general concept of the universe, and 
is maintained only at the expense of logical consistency. If man in the 
state of confused knowledge is a slave to passion, "because he is part 
of nature" and is therefore subject to the iron rule of necessity, 
which governs all things from substance down to the least of the modes 
of substance, it follows that man cannot become free except by ceasing 
to be part of nature, and this he can never do. If in the state of 
bondage there is no germ of freedom, freedom cannot be developed by any 
development of knowledge. Spinoza cannot consistently avoid 
determinism. He should never have tried to emancipate man, just as he 
should never have attempted to derive the manifold from the one.<p>

(c) We come now to the third stage in the moral emancipation of the 
human mind, namely, to that in which man attains to the <i>intellectual 
love of God</i> and the <i>blessed immortality</i>. In the fifth part 
of the <i>Ethica</i> Spinoza teaches that the mind, arriving at the 
culminating stage of intellectual development (<i>scientia 
intuitiva</i>) wherein it sees all things in God, "can bring it about 
 <!--
SPINOZA'S DOCTRINE OF IMMORTALITY 483 
 --><A NAME="p483"></a>
 that all bodily affections and images of things are referred to the 
idea of God."<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> When this state is reached all passion ceases, and 
emotion and volition are absorbed in the knowledge and love of God 
(<i>amor intellectualis Dei</i>). This intellectual love of God is the 
highest kind of virtue, and it not only makes man free but also confers 
immortality. For this love has no relation to the body or to bodily 
states, and consequently it cannot in any way be affected by the 
destruction of the body. But here it naturally occurs to us to ask, 
What has become of the principle that to every mode of thought there 
corresponds a mode of extension? When the body perishes, what extension 
mode corresponds to the eternal thought which is bliss and immortality? 
Spinoza answers that, while the mode of extension which is the human 
body conditioned by time and space perishes, there remains the essence 
of the body which is conceived under a form of eternity. At the same 
time the sensitive and imaginative part of the soul perishes with the 
actual body, so that the ultimate conclusion is that both body and soul 
are partly mortal and partly immortal.<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup><p>

We must not overlook the fact that in his <i>Ethica</i> Spinoza speaks 
of the <i>eternity</i> rather than of the <i>immortality</i> of the 
soul; and by eternity he does not primarily mean unending duration, but 
a kind of rational necessity by which a thing forms, once for all, an 
integral part of the universe, although, of course, what is necessarily 
a part of the universe cannot cease to exist. Moreover, this eternity 
or deathlessness is <i>a condition into which the soul enters in this 
life</i>. "The immortality which is sanctioned by Spinoza's principles 
is not a quantitative, but a qualitative endowment, -- not existence 
for indefinite time, but the quality of being above all time."<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup> 
Spinoza does not conceive immortality as originally and equally 
inherent in all men; he Conceives it as something to be acquired by 
each man for himself, and as capable of being acquired in different 
degrees. 
 <!--
484 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p484"></a><p>

Finally, we may ask whether the immortality of which Spinoza speaks is 
immortality at all. Is there in this concept of immortality a survival 
of the individual? On the one hand, Spinoza teaches that imagination 
and memory perish with the actual body; and with these faculties perish 
all the recollections, associations, educated nerve-processes, and 
everything else which serves to perpetuate personal traits and 
characteristics. On the other hand, Spinoza is careful to guard against 
the doctrine of absorption of the individual in God; for he teaches<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> 
that final happiness is a state in which man, in attaining the highest 
unity with God, attains at the same time the highest consciousness of 
self, so that in this union the distinction between God and creature is 
not obliterated, but rather accentuated. The conclusion seems to be that 
the blessed life is a state in which we shall retain our individuality, 
but shall have, apparently, no means of recognizing ourselves as the 
same individuals.<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. What first arrests our attention in the 
study of Spinoza's philosophy is the strict geometrical method which he 
adopted. Starting with the definition of substance, he proceeds to 
deduce from a single truth a whole system of philosophy. From this 
definition we follow him to the point where he first attempts to 
account for the diversity of things, and there his first lapse into 
inconsistency occurs. In order to account for the diversity of things 
he is forced to assume something besides the one inert substance, and 
over and over again he surreptitiously introduces a principle which the 
logic of his premises can never justify. The truth is that, as has 
already been said, if Spinoza had been perfectly consistent he should 
never have attempted to go beyond the definition of substance, which is 
his starting point, and should also have been the final goal of his 
system.<p>

In attempting to explain away the inconsistencies of Spinoza's thought, 
some have overlooked the individualistic elements in 
 <!--
HISTORICAL POSITION OF SPINOZA 485 
 --><A NAME="p485"></a>
 his system and represented him merely as a pantheist, while others, 
looking upon the pantheistic elements as mere formulas, represent him 
as an empiricist.<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup> ,To one he is a "God-intoxicated man"; to another 
he is a sordid and filthy atheist (sordidus et lutulentus atheus</i>). 
Both these views are in a certain sense correct, and yet both are 
wrong. For if we consider merely the speculative elements in Spinoza's 
philosophy, we must pronounce him to be at once a pantheist and an 
empiricist, an anomalous being reminding us of the winged hull of 
Assyrian art, -- a creature of air and a creature of earth. But, as 
has been pointed out above, Spinoza's aim was practical, rather than 
theoretical. We must not picture him as concerned merely with the 
speculative aspect of the problems of philosophy; we must rather 
picture him as he represents himself, and as we know him from the 
events of his life, -- a poor, persecuted Jew, rejected by his
 co-religionists and despised by his Christian neighbors, bearing in 
patience the sufferings which were his lot in life. For him metaphysics 
was what it never had been even for Plato, a religion and a refuge. In 
it he hoped to find that view of the universe which would reconcile him 
to his own hard fate and enable him to rise to a plane where his 
enemies could not reach him. We should bear these facts in mind when we 
criticise Spinoza, and, though they should not render us blind to his 
errors, which are many and serious, they should enable us to understand 
his thought, which is often sublime and is always deserving of 
sympathetic attention.<p>
