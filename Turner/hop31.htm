WILLIAM OF CHAMPEAUX 279  
 --><A NAME="p279"></a>
<h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXXI<br>
WILLIAM OF CHAMPEAUX, THE INDIFFERENTISTS, ETC.</h3><p>

WILLIAM OF CHAMPEAUX<p>

<b>Life</b>. William of Champeaux was, like St. Anselm, an opponent of 
the nominalism of Roscelin. He was born at Champeaux, a village near 
Melun, about the year 1070. At an early age he repaired to Paris to 
study under the renowned Alsatian teacher Manegold of Lautenbach. Later 
on he studied dialectic at Roscelin's school in Compi&egrave;gne and 
theology at the school of Laon, over which the theologian Anselm (not 
St. Anselm of Canterbury) at that time presided. In 1103 he was 
summoned to Paris, was made archdeacon, and appointed to the chair of 
philosophy in the cathedral school. In 1108 he retired to the monastery 
of St. Victor, where he continued his career as a teacher and gave the 
initiative to the mystic movement which is associated with that abbey. 
He was promoted in 1113 to the see of Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Marne. He died 
in 1121.<p>

William of Champeaux enjoyed among his contemporaries a very high 
reputation for learning and sanctity. He was known as the <i>Columna 
Doctorum</i>; according to Abelard, he was <i>re et fama 
praecipuus</i>; and when he died it was said that "the light of the 
Word of God was extinguished on earth."<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Of the philosophical writings of William of Champeaux 
we possess merely some fragments: a portion of the work <i>De Origine 
Animae</i>, published by Martene, and forty-two fragments discovered at 
Troyes by Ravaisson, portions also of a <i>Liber Sententiarum</i> and a 
<i>Dialogus seu Altercatio Cujusdam Christiani etJudaei</i>.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Our 
chief secondary sources of information are Abelard, who constantly 
refers to his rival teacher, and John of Salisbury. Michaud's 
<i>Guillaume de Champeaux</i> (Paris, 1867) is an excellent study of 
our philosopher and his times.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Problem of Universals</b>. According to Abelard, William maintained 
that the universal is wholly and essentially present in each 
individual: 
 <!--
280 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p280"></a><p>

<blockquote>
Erat autem ea sententia ut eamdem <i>essentialiter</i> rem totam simul 
singulis suis inesse adstrueret individuis; quorum quidem nulla esset 
in essentia diversitas sed sola multitudine accidentium varietas.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote>
  
Universals, therefore, exist in individual things. This is the thesis 
of <i>realism</i>. That by the word <i>essentialiter</i> William meant 
to convey a doctrine of exaggerated realism is apparent from the 
objections which Abelard urged against him. Among Abelard's objections 
we find the following: If the essence of humanity is wholly and 
essentially present in Socrates, it is not where Socrates is not. But 
it is also wholly and essentially present in Plato; therefore, Socrates 
must always be where Plato is.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Unable to refute this and similar objections, William of Champeaux, 
after his retirement to St. Victor, formulated a new thesis in which he 
maintained that the universal is in the individual, not in the entirety 
of its essence, but by reason of its particular or individual 
modifications: "Sic autem istam suam correxit sententiam," says 
Abelard, "ut deinceps rem eamdem non <i>essentialiter</i> sed 
<i>individualiter</i> diceret."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Even if we substitute for the word 
<i>individualiter</i> the word <i>indifferenter</i> (and there seems to 
be better manuscript authority for <i>indifferenter</i>),<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> we cannot 
arrive at a definite conclusion as to what was the precise meaning of 
the change which Abelard forced on his adversary. It is obvious, 
however, that the substitution of <i>individualiter</i> or 
<i>indifferenter</i> for <i>essentialiter</i> was meant as a concession 
to the anti-realists; the corrected expression was intended to convey a 
doctrine of more temperate realism. The end of the  
 <!--
OTTO OF TOURNAI 281 
 --><A NAME="p281"></a>
 controversy, if we are to accept Abelard's authority, was that 
William, after having modified his first thesis, was obliged to abandon 
the second thesis altogether. The truth, however, seems to be that, 
although Abelard carried off the honors of the debate, William 
continued to teach realism while he remained at St. Victor.<p>

<b>Psychological Doctrines</b>. In the work <i>De Origine Animae</i> 
William refutes the doctrine of the traducianists (according to whom 
the soul of the child is in some way derived from the parents) 
and <i>defends the creationist doctrine</i> that the soul is created 
immediately by God. He teaches that the soul is a simple substance and 
that it is not distinct from its faculties or their operations.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> He 
describes in the following terms the relation between body and soul:<p>

<blockquote>
Quae duo (corpus scilicet et anima) ita quodammodo sunt inserta ut et 
corpus per spiritum sensificaretur, i.e., illos quinque sensus haberet, 
et anima naturam corporis ita contraheret ut inde sensificaret, et 
irasceretur, vel concupisceret vel esuriret.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. William of Champeaux represents an 
important phase in the development of the doctrine of universal 
concepts. His most noteworthy contribution to philosophy is, however, 
his doctrine of creationism. It will be remembered that St. Augustine 
refused to decide the question of the origin of the soul. William is 
the first Christian philosopher in the West to maintain definitely and 
unhesitatingly the creation of the individual soul.<p>

Associated with William of Champeaux are the realists <b>Otto of 
Tournai, Adelard of Bath</b>, and <b>Walter of Mortagne</b>.<p>

OTTO OF TOURNAI<p>

<b>Life</b>. Otto, or Odon, of Tournai (died 1113), was professor at 
Tournai, abbot of the monastery of St. Martin in that city, and 
subsequently bishop of Cambrai. Such was his renown as a teacher that 
Herman says, "Cives  
 <!--
282 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p282"></a>
 omnes relictis allis operibus soli philosophiae deditos crederes."<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> 
After he had devoted much attention to the study of Plato, he chanced 
one day to read some of St. Augustine's treatises against the 
Manicheans, and henceforth he gave all his time and attention to the 
study of theology. Before he took up the study of theology he composed 
several philosophical works. His principal theological treatise is 
entitled <i>De Peccato Originali</i>. His works are published by Migne 
(<i>Patr. Lat.</i>, Vol. CLX).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Otto was a Platonic realist. This appears from the work just mentioned 
and also from certain verses which were written by a contemporary, 
probably by a disciple of Otto, and attached to a manuscript copy of 
Boethius' work <i>De Hypotheticis Syllogismis</i>.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> He applied 
exaggerated realism (1) to the doctrine of original sin, teaching 
that the whole human race is one substance, and that, when our first 
parents sinned the whole race was vitiated, because the humanity which 
existed then as really as it exists now was contaminated; (2) to the 
account of the origin of the soul, maintaining that the act of creation 
consists merely in the production of new properties, which adhere in a 
previously existing substance, and serve to distinguish one soul from 
another, there being no substantial difference between individual souls.<p>

<b>Hildebert of Lavardin</b>, a Platonist poet and mystic philosopher, 
belongs to the same school as Otto. Haur&eacute;au has been obliged to 
reconsider his decision that Hildebert was the author of the <i>Tractatus 
Theologicus</i>, which, according to some historians, was the model used by 
Peter the Lombard in composing his Sentences.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
ADELARD OF BATH 283  
 --><A NAME="p283"></a><p>

ADELARD OF BATH<p>

<b>Life</b>. Adelard of Bath (circa 1100), who, about the beginning of 
the twelfth century, studied at Tours and at Laon, was the first of the 
mediaeval teachers to seek enlightenment by traveling in Greece and 
Asia Minor. His principal works are <i>Questiones Naturales</i>, 
published in 1472, and a treatise <i>De Eodem et Diverso</i>, which has 
recently been published in <i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Gesch. der Phil. des 
Mittelalters</i> (IV, I).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Adelard is a Platonist. He teaches that ideas are innate, having been 
placed in the soul by the Creator at the beginning of the world:<p>

Conditor immensitatis . . . praecellenti naturae quam animam vocamus 
intellectuales formas omnium creaturarum induit. . . . Illum itaque 
formarum intellectualium thesaurum non semper, sed cum necesse est, 
explicat.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In the treatise <i>De Eodem et Diverso</i> Adelard solves the problem 
of universals by the doctrine of <i>indifferentism</i>, which closely 
resembles the second form of William of Champeaux's realism. The 
indifferentists maintained that in every individual we may distinguish 
the determinations which belong to the individual, namely, the 
differentiating mark (<i>differens</i>), and the generic or specific 
part of the individual, namely, the common element (<i>indifferens</i>) 
which it shares with others of the same genus or species. The latter 
alone is universal. Making a further distinction between essence and 
substance, the indifferentists granted that the <i>essence</i> includes 
the <i>differens</i>; and therefore, they argued, there is no universal 
essence. They contended, however, that substance does not include the 
<i>differens</i>, and thence they inferred that substance is 
(physically) one and common to all individuals.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup>

WALTER OF MORTAGNE<p>

<b>Walter of Mortagne</b> was born about the beginning of the twelfth 
century, at Mortagne in Flanders. After studying at Tournai, he went to 
Paris, where from 1136 to 1144 he taught at the school of Ste. 
Genevi&egrave;ve. He died bishop of Laon in 1174. He composed a work 
entitled <i>Tractatus de Sancta Trinitate</i> and six <i>Opuscula</i>. 
Five of the <i>Opuscula</i> are published in D'Achery's 
<i>Spicilegium</i> (Paris, 1723), and the sixth in Migne's <i>Patr. 
Lat.</i>, Vol. CLXXXVI, col. 1052.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Walter, like Adelard, is a Platonist. In a letter to Abelard<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> he 
expresses the belief that the body is an obstacle to the higher 
operations of the soul. He is best known, however, by his doctrine of 
non-difference or indifference, which is described by John of 
Salisbury, his disciple, in the following terms:<p>

<blockquote>
 Hic, ideo quod omne quod est unum numero est, rem universalem aut unam 
numero esse aut omnino non esse concedit. Sed, quia impossibile 
substantialia non esse, existentibus his quorum sunt substantialia, 
denuo colligunt universalia singularibus, quod ad essentiam, unienda. 
Partiuntur itaque <i>status</i>, duce Gualtero de Mauritania, et 
Platonem in eo quod Plato est, individuum; in eo quod homo, speciem; in 
eo quod animal, genus, sed subalternum; in eo quod substantia, 
generalissimum.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> 
 </blockquote><p>

The doctrine of indifferentism is further described in a document, No. 
17813 of the <i>Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale</i>, published by 
Haur&eacute;au in 1892, and attributed by him to Walter. The document 
defines <i>differens</i> and <i>indifferens</i>, and proceeds:<p>

<blockquote>
Et attende quod Socrates et unumquodque individuum hominis, in eo quod 
unumquodque est animal rationale mortale, sunt unum et idem.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

It is worthy of remark that in this document the <i>status</i> of which 
John of Salisbury speaks are called <i>attentiones</i>. They suggest at 
once the <i>formalitates</i> of Duns Scotus.  
 <!--
ABELARD 285  
 --><A NAME="p285"></a><p>

The question of the interpretation of the passage just quoted is to be 
answered according to the meaning attached to the phrase "unum et 
idem." Does it mean mere logical unity, or does it mean that there is 
in the world of reality a one which is "animal rationale mortale"? If 
the unity is merely logical, -- the work of the mind, as the word 
<i>attentio</i> seems to imply, -- we have here the nearest approach of 
realism to the moderate realism of St. Thomas. If, on the contrary, the 
unity is real and objective, we have, instead, a form of Platonic 
realism. We must decide in favor of the latter interpretation, for it 
is on the supposition that the latter is the true interpretation, and 
on that supposition alone, that we can understand the objections which 
Abelard and others urged against the doctrine of indifferentism.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The school of Tournai and the advocates of 
indifferentism represent an attempt at founding a realistic doctrine of 
universals on an eclectic union of Platonic and Aristotelian 
principles. Before we take up the history of the more thoroughgoing 
Platonism of the school of Chartres it is necessary to study the 
philosophy of Abelard, the opponent of realism and the chief advocate 
of what was then understood to be the Aristotelian doctrine of 
concepts.<p>
