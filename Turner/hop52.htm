PROTESTANT MYSTICISM</h3><p>

Mention has already been made of the Protestant Reformation as one of 
the causes which led to the change from mediaeval to modern modes of 
thought. Perhaps it would be more correct to regard both the Reform and 
the rise of modern philosophy as effects of a common cause; for modern 
philosophy is, as Erdmann observes, "Protestantism in the sphere of the 
thinking spirit." At all events, wherever the influence of the first 
reformers asserted itself, Scholastic philosophy was discouraged, and 
an effort was made to replace it by a new order of ideas. Lutheranism, 
according to Erasmus, was opposed to all literary culture: "Ubicumque 
regnat Lutheranismus, ibi literarum est interitus." Whether this be 
true or false, certain it is that 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p439"></a>
 not only Luther, but also Zwingli, Calvin, and Melanchthon, did their 
utmost to eradicate the principles of Scholasticism. Scholasticism 
stood for ecclesiasticism, orthodoxy, respect for authority, in a word, 
for everything against which the first reformers protested.<p>

Among the reformers themselves there soon sprang up systems of 
philosophy. <b>Luther</b> (1483-1546), by his distinction between 
reason (a function of the flesh) and faith (a function of the spirit), 
laid the foundation for psychological dualism. <b>Zwingli</b>
 (1484-1531), imbued with the spirit of humanism, maintained a 
pantheistic doctrine of Divine Immanence, and taught that man is 
deified by divine regeneration. <b>Melanchthon</b> (1497-1560) 
developed a system of Aristotelian philosophy which may be styled a 
Protestant Scholasticism.<p>

Of greater importance than these philosophical tenets of the first 
reformers are the systems of mysticism which grew out of the religious 
doctrines of the Reformation. <b>Franck</b> (1500-1545), of whom 
mention has already been made,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> developed a system of mysticism 
characterized by pantheism and psychological dualism (antithesis of 
flesh and spirit). He was succeeded by <b>Weigel</b> (1533-1588), who 
taught that regeneration is to be attained by abandoning the <i>I-ness 
(Ichheit)</i> of the individual nature. All these mystic tendencies 
find their fullest expression in the writings of <b>Jakob 
B&ouml;hme</b> (1575-1624), the chief representative of Protestant 
mysticism.<p>

JAKOB B&Ouml;HME<p>

<b>Life</b>. Jakob B&ouml;hme was born at Altseidenberg, near 
G&ouml;rlitz, in the year 1575. Until he was ten years old, he received 
absolutely no education and he never extended his knowledge of 
literature beyond an acquaintance with the Bible and with the writings 
of Weigel. He earned his living by mending shoes, and the " Cobbler of 
G&ouml;rlitz" is sometimes referred to as the "German Philosopher" in 
allusion to the fact that his works  
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p440"></a>
 were composed in German -- the only language in which he could write. 
He died in 1624. His principal work is entitled <i>Aurora</i>, or 
<i>The Rising Dawn</i>.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

B&ouml;hme devoted special attention to the problem of evil. He taught 
that the ultimate cause of the evil which exists in the world is the 
eternal dualism of God Himself. Perceiving one day the sunlight 
reflected from a tin vessel, he conceived the idea that, as the dark 
vessel reveals the brightness of the sun, so the element of evil in God 
shows forth the goodness of the Divine Nature. For everything, he 
taught, is known by its opposite. Without evil there would be no 
revelation of God, no distinction of things, no life, no movement. Nay, 
more, if there were not in God a principle antithetical to goodness, 
God could not even arrive at a knowledge of Himself.<p>

Developing this idea of the dualism of the Divine Nature, B&ouml;hme 
describes in the language of mysticism the eternal nature of God as 
containing seven primordial qualities, of which three represent the 
divine anger and three the divine love. Intermediate between these is 
the divine fire which is the principle of life. The Divine Nature in 
the first stage of development, namely, in that of will without object, 
is God the Father. The Father, looking into His own nature, forms in 
Himself the image of Himself and thus "divides" into Father and Son. 
The procession of this vision from the original groundless nature of 
God as will, is God the Holy Ghost. Lucifer became enamored of the 
anger qualities of God, and, refusing to take part in the advance from 
darkness to light, remained wholly evil. As a result of the fall of 
Lucifer, the material world was created. Heaven and hell are 
experienced here on earth: he who, like Lucifer, becomes enamored of 
evil, and clings to it, is in hell, while he who renounces all the evil 
that is in self, and joins in the development of light from darkness, 
is in heaven.

<b>Historical Position</b>. In the writings of B&ouml;hme we see the 
mystic tendency run riot. Free from the restraint of orthodox dogma, 
Bohme made the fullest use of the Protestant principle of private 
interpretation, and expounded the doctrines of scripture from the 
extreme individualistic point of view. No one, however, can question 
the intense earnestness, the true-hearted sensibility, and the 
unusually deep and vigorous spirituality of the man. It is these 
qualities that have secured for B&ouml;hme a permanent place in the 
history of German literature. They also account for the influence which 
he exerted on such men as Schelling and Hegel.<p>
