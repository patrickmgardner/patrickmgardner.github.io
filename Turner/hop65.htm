HEGEL<p>

<b>Life</b>. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was born at Stuttgart in 
1770. His life, like that of all the great post-Kantian philosophers, 
is merely the history of his academic and literary career. At the age 
of eighteen he entered the theological seminary at T&uuml;bingen, where 
he devoted himself to the study of Kant and Rousseau, having for 
companions Schelling and the young poet H&ouml;lderlin, whose 
enthusiasm for Greek poetry he fully shared. The years 1793-1800 he 
spent as private tutor at Berne and at Frankfurt-am-Main; years in 
which, through the study of Hellenic literature, he attained a 
realization of the spiritual significance of nature as the key to the 
harmony of existence. In 1801 he entered the University of Jena, and, 
after a few years spent there as <i>Privatdocent</i>, was appointed 
professor extraordinary (1805). While at Jena he renewed his 
acquaintance with Schelling, who was at that time editor of the 
<i>Critical Journal 
 <!--
HEGEL 561 
 --><A NAME="p561"></a>
 of Philosophy</i>. Soon, however, divergence of opinion between the 
two great opponents of Fichte's subjectivism led to the development by 
Hegel of a system opposed to the philosophy of identity; in 1807 he 
published his <i>Ph&auml;nomenologie des Geistes</i>, his first 
important contribution to speculative philosophy. After spending a year 
as newspaper editor at Bamberg, Hegel became rector of the gymnasium at 
Nuremberg, and while there published his <i>Logik</i> 
(<i>Wissenschaft</i> der Logik, 1816). In 1816 he was made professor of 
philosophy at Heidelberg, and in 1818 was transferred to the University 
of Berlin. While at Heidelberg he published the <i>Encyclopaedia</i> 
(<i>Encyklop&auml;die der philosophischen Wissenschaften im 
Grundrisse</i>, 1817). He died at Berlin in 1831.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Hegel's works were published soon after his death 
(Berlin, 1832 ff.), in nineteen volumes, the last volume being the life 
of Hegel written by Rosenkranz. The <i>Journal of Speculative 
Philosophy</i> (Vols. I-V, St. Louis, 1867-1871) published translations 
of the <i>Ph&auml;nomenologie</i> and of portions of the 
<i>Encyklop&auml;die</i>. The <i>Logik</i> was translated by W. T. 
Harris, and is to be found in the second volume of the <i>Journal</i> 
just referred to. Wallace has published translations of the most 
important portions of the <i>Encyklop&auml;die</i> (<i>The Logic of 
Hegel</i>, Oxford, 1892, and <i>Hegel's Philosophy of Mind</i>, Oxford, 
1894). The translation of the <i>Vorlesungen &uuml;ber die Philosophie 
der Geschichte</i>, by Sibree, is published in Bohn's Library 
(<i>Philosophy of History</i>, London, 1860, 1884).<p>

Professor Caird's <i>Hegel</i> (<i>Blackwood's Philosophical 
Classics</i>, Edinburgh and Philadelphia, 1896) will be found very 
useful by those who are not prepared to take up Stirling's formidable 
exposition, <i>The Secret of Hegel</i> (2 vols., London, 1865; vol., 
Edinburgh and London, 1898). <i>Mind</i>, especially in the new series, 
contains many valuable articles expository and explanatory of Hegelian 
philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> See also Fischer's <i>Hegel</i> (Heidelberg, 1898-1901).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>The Problem of Philosophy</b>. Thus far, in following the course of 
the development of philosophic thought in Germany, we have 
 <!--
562 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p562"></a>
 found that Kant, by failing to complete the synthesis of ultimate 
reality, bequeathed the problem towards the solution of which all
 post-Kantian speculation was directed. Fichte completed the synthesis 
by merging the thing-in-itself (object) in the activity of the Ego 
(subject). Schelling tried to effect a synthesis equally complete by 
merging both subject and object in the indifference of the Absolute. 
Hegel now approaches the problem anew. Dissatisfied with Schelling's 
solution of the problem, he proposes to substitute for the Absolute of 
indifference an Absolute of immanent activity. According to Schelling, 
nature and spirit (object and subject) <i>proceed from</i> the 
Absolute; according to Hegel, the Absolute <i>becomes</i> successively 
nature and spirit. The Absolute of Hegel's speculative system is a 
<i>process</i> rather than a <i>source</i>; it is infinite, but, unlike 
the Spinozistic substance, it is <i>an infinite of activity, 
opposition, and tension</i>, rather than of static immensity and 
undifferentiated plenitude; it is a maelstrom rather than a sea of 
unruffled rest.<p>

This concept of the Absolute is Hegel's starting point; but we can 
understand neither his starting point nor his method unless we first 
obtain a clear conception of <i>the frame of mind</i> in which he 
approaches the problems of philosophy. In Fichte, as in Kant, the 
ethical character predominated, and in Fichte's philosophy the 
practical reason retained its supremacy. In Schelling it was the 
scientific-artistic character that prevailed, and in his philosophy the 
real and the ideal, the rational and the imaginative, were given equal 
play. <i>In Hegel, the rational or idealistic, temperament is 
predominant</i>; in his vast philosophical synthesis the theoretical is 
placed supreme above the practical, and action is subordinated to 
thought, for thought is the center and sum of reality: "the rational 
alone is real"; "all being is thought realized, and all becoming is a 
development of thought." Mere science, he observes, looks for the 
causal explanations of phenomena; philosophy seeks to find the ideal 
interpretation of 
 <!--
HEGEL'S DEFINITION OF PHILOSOPHY 563
 --><A NAME="p563"></a>
 phenomena, to understand them in terms of the Absolute, which is 
thought.<p>

As to content, therefore, <i>philosophy does not go beyond 
experience</i>; it is, to repeat Kant's distinction, transcendental but 
not transcendent. Indeed, it cannot go beyond rational experience, 
since the rational alone is real, and philosophy must necessarily be in 
harmony with actuality and experience.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> As to form, however, philosophy 
differs from the empirical sciences; for, to the laws, classifications, 
and categories of these sciences it adds the categories of notion, 
being, essence, etc. In logic, as we shall see, these categories are 
studied, as it were, <i>in vacuo</i>, that is, devoid of all empirical 
content; but in the philosophy of nature and in the philosophy of mind 
they are studied in their development and determination. Logic is, 
nevertheless, a science of reality, for in it reality is studied 
<i>through</i> the abstract categories.<p>

Hegel's is a <i>critical philosophy</i>; yet it is, at the same time, 
systematic or constructive. It is, as Wallace says, "a system which is 
self-critical and systematic only through the absoluteness of its 
criticism;"<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> or, to use Hegel's own phrase, it is "an immanent and 
incessant dialectic."<p>

Briefly, then, Hegel 's philosophy is <i>idealism</i> in the absolute 
sense of the word, -- logical or conceptual rather than ethical or 
scientific. It is a <i>philosophy of identity</i>, inasmuch as it looks 
upon nature and spirit as manifestations of a higher Absolute. It is a 
philosophy of development, inasmuch as the Absolute from which it 
deduces nature and spirit is not a static but a dynamic <i>prius</i>. 
This dynamic <i>prius</i> of nature and spirit is the process from 
<i>in-itself (an-sich)</i> through <i>out-of-self (f&uuml;rsich, 
Anders-sein)</i> to <i>for-itself (an-und-f&uuml;sich)</i>.<p>

Before passing to consider Hegel's method it is necessary to emphasize 
the importance of <i>the idea of development</i> and to explain the 
principle which governs all development, whether  
 <!--
564 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p564"></a>
 in the purely logical order or in nature and mind. In its barest 
statement, the principle is that all development passes through three 
stages, -- <i>in-itself, out-of-self</i>, and <i>for-itself</i>. This 
may be called a metaphysical application of the maxim on which the 
mystics insist, namely, "Die to live." For it pertains to the very 
essence of spirit that through disintegration it must attain to 
reintegration, through diversity to unity, through strife to peace, 
through opposition to agreement. It is a law of thought as well as a 
law of being (and thought is being) that <i>a concept or a thing 
realizes itself by going out from itself</i> (losing itself in the 
other) <i>and returning to itself</i>. To take one of Hegel's favorite 
examples: Freedom is developed by discipline, which is its opposite. 
The freedom of the child is surrendered in the discipline of education 
in order to become the mature freedom of the man, and the freedom of 
the man is in turn surrendered in the discipline of law in order to 
become the freedom of the citizen.<p>

<b>Hegel's Method</b> is to be understood in the light of this 
principle of development. Fichte, while admitting in theory that 
philosophic method consists in the use of <i>thesis, antithesis</i>, 
and <i>synthesis</i>, failed to develop this idea of method and to 
apply it to every department of thought. Schelling relied on intuition, 
and gave free scope to his exuberant imagination. Hegel insists on the 
pruning of the imaginative faculty and the discussion of all intuitions 
by means of <i>dialectic</i>. Philosophy, he observes, being the 
<i>thinking study of things</i>, does not stop at the intuition which 
presents the thing (object) in its immediate unity, for that is only 
part of the truth, but follows it out into the self-mediation whereby 
it passes into its opposites and back again to reconstructed unity. 
Philosophy, therefore, must pursue a concept or an object from its 
immediate unity into the divergence of opposites, so as to arrive at 
the full truth in the reconciliation of opposites. For "all position is 
negation" (every concept contains its opposite), and "all negation is 
position" (every 
 <!--
HEGEL'S DIVISION OF PHILOSOPHY 565
 --><A NAME="p565"></a>
 opposite contains that to which it is opposed); so that neither in 
affirmation nor in negation is there the full truth, but in the 
reaffirmation which follows affirmation and negation. Here we have the 
famous dialectical method, the triadism which determines the division 
as well as the method of Hegel's philosophy.<p>

It is important to note here that "At least the first and third 
category (the <i>in-itself</i> and <i>for-itself</i>) in every triad 
may be looked upon as definitions of the Absolute, or metaphysical 
definitions of God, -- the first where the thought-form of the triad is 
formulated in its simplicity, and the third being the return from 
differentiation to a simple self-reference. The second sub-category 
(the <i>out-of-self</i>) in each triad, where the grade of thought is 
in its differentiation, gives, on the other hand, a definition of the 
finite."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

We shall find as we proceed triad within triad. The first great triad 
is <i>Idea, nature</i>, and <i>spirit</i>, which gives us the division 
of philosophy.<p>

<b>Division of Philosophy</b>. Philosophy starts with the Idea. It is 
scarcely necessary to remark that the term Idea does not here designate 
a phenomenon of the individual consciousness, but the system of reason, 
the sum of reality. Now the Idea, following the law of development, is 
at first <i>in-itself (an-sich)</i>, then <i>outside itself 
(f&uuml;rsich, Anders-sein)</i>, and finally, <i>for-itself
 (an-und-f&uuml;rsich)</i> There are, therefore, three parts of 
philosophy: (1) <i>logic</i>, the science of the Idea in itself; (2) 
<i>philosophy of nature</i>, the science of the Idea outside itself, or 
in the state of otherness; (3) <i>philosophy of mind</i>, the science 
of the Idea come back to itself out of otherness.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> In each of these 
divisions there are subordinate triadic divisions, so that each part is 
a circle rounded and completed in itself, while philosophy as a whole 
resembles a circle of circles.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup><p>

1. <b>Logic</b> is the <i>science of the pure Idea</i>. This does not 
mean that logic is the science of the forms of thought, or that it is 
 <!--
566 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p566"></a>
 the science of mere thought. It is the science of reality; for the 
Idea is the sum of reality, -- the synthetic unity of expenence. 
Logic differs from the other parts of philosophy merely in this, that 
it is the science of reality looked at through the medium of pure or 
abstract thought. If, then, logic is the "morphology of thought," 
Hegelian logic is the morphology of the world, of life, of reality. As 
Hegel himself says, "Logic coincides with metaphysics, the science of 
things set and held in thoughts."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

It is important to remark here that the <i>identification of logic with 
metaphysics</i> necessitates a change in the meaning of the word 
"category" and in that of the phrase "deduction of the categories." The 
forms of thought are for Hegel what they were for none of his Kantian 
predecessors, forms of being in a sense akin to that which the 
schoolmen attached to <i>substantial forms</i>, although, of course, 
they differ radically from the Scholastic forms inasmuch as they are 
wholly dynamic processes rather than static entities conceived after 
some remote analogy to a mold or die. If, then, the categories are 
processes of being as well as forms of thought, the deduction of the 
categories will be the tracing of their genealogy from the first form, 
which is Being. It will not be enough to enumerate the categories and 
to indicate their systematic articulation; it will be necessary to 
discover and demonstrate their genetic connection, their functional 
dependence, so to speak, on one another. Logic is not only the 
<i>morphology</i>, it is also the <i>physiology of thought</i>.<p>

It is important to note also that neither in the logic nor anywhere 
else in Hegelian philosophy are the categories discovered. The task of 
discovering the categories belongs to experience and to the empirical 
sciences. The categories being given, philosophy shows how they grow 
out of each other and are phases of the same reality. Philosophy not 
merely enumerates them, for that would be simply a <i>mechanical</i> 
synthesis; it also shows their 
 <!--
HEGEL'S DOCTRINE OF BEING 567 
 --><A NAME="p567"></a>
 functional interdependence and interconnection, thus effecting an 
<i>organic</i> synthesis.<p>

Logic is divided into (A) <i>Doctrine of Being (Sein)</i>, that is, of 
the ldea in its immediacy; (B) <i>Doctrine of Essence (Wesen)</i> that 
is, of the Idea in its reflection or mediation; (C) <i>Doctrine of 
Notion (Begriff)</i>, that is, of the Idea returned to itself. Being is 
the notion implicit, or in germ; essence is the show or appearance 
(<i>Schein</i>) of the notion, and the notion is Being or Idea in and 
for itself.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

A. <i>Doctrine of Being</i>. Logic begins with Being, because Being is, 
on the one hand, pure thought, and, on the other, immediacy itself, 
simple and indeterminate. Now, if Being is complete indeterminateness, 
it is ideatical with Nothing (<i>Nichts</i>). Let us see what Hegel 
means by the famous formula <i>Being = Nothing</i>. He means that, 
while there is undoubtedly a distinction between Being and Nothing, 
<i>the distinction is not absolute but only relative</i>. When 
Aristotle enunciated the principle of contradiction, he gave expression 
to what is only part of the truth. For, if it is true that every object 
and every thought is differentiated from every other object and every 
other thought, and is therefore identical with itself (A is not Not-A, 
A = A), it is no less true that every object and every thought is 
related to every other object and every other thought, and that, in so 
far as it is related to another, it is differentiated from itself and 
identical with that other (A is not A, A = Not-A). Aristotle, 
emphasizing one aspect of thought, namely its differentiating power, 
and failing to realize the equal importance of the relating power of 
thought, formulated the principle of contradiction -- the 
differentiation of things -- as if it were an absolute truth, whereas 
it is only relative to one aspect of thought and being. Looking at 
thought and being from the view point of totality, we see that the 
absolute differentiation or the absolute identity of concepts or of 
things is but part of the truth, the whole truth 
 <!--
568 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p568"></a>
 being that concepts and things are <i>partially differentiated and 
partially identified</i>. We have consequently as much right to say 
that Being is Nothing as that Being is Being, since the whole truth is 
that Being is both Being and Nothing, -- it is <i>Becoming (das 
Werden)</i>. Here we have the barest and most abstract form of 
development by means of the union of opposites. Becoming is, as Hegel 
himself says, a <i>poor</i> term (meager of content). Life and mind are 
higher, richer, more intense unions of opposites than is mere 
<i>becoming</i>, which, however, is the abstract formula of life and 
mind.<p>

The result of the union of Being and Nothing in Becoming is, first, the 
process itself, -- an endless swaying, a constant tension; and 
secondly, at each stage of the process, a product, so that to Being 
identical with Nothing succeeds <i>determinate being</i>, or what we 
call <i>something</i>, or <i>being-then-and-there (Dasein)</i>. Now the 
determinateness of Being is, in its immediacy, <i>quality</i>, from 
which are deduced the categories <i>otherwise-being, negation, limit, 
alteration, being-for-self</i>, which is the one with its 
<i>attraction</i> and <i>repulsion</i>; but in attraction and repulsion 
the one annuls itself and its determinates, becoming the many; at this 
point, therefore, <i>quality</i> passes over into <i>quantity</i>.<p>

<i>Quantity</i> is defined as "pure Being where the mode or character 
(quality) is no longer taken as one with the being itself, but 
explicitly put as superseded or indifferent." Quantity arises from a 
unit and the identification or equalization of (other) units.<p>

Completing now the triadic circle within pure Being, we have <i>measure 
(Mass) as the union of quality and quantity</i>. In measure these two are 
united (so, for example, progressive diminution in temperature causes a 
transition from heat to cold); for quantity is implicitly quality, and 
quality is implicitly quantity.<p>

Being which is thus determined by quality, quantity, and measure 
becomes essence, or, in other words, the determinations quality, 
quantity, and measure being transitory, the result of their dialectic 
is essence. 
 <!--
HEGEL'S DOCTRINE OF ESSENCE 569  
 --><A NAME="p569"></a><p>

B. <i>Doctrine of Essence. Essence (Wesen)</i> is defined as Being 
coming into mediation with itself through the negativity of itself. 
Being, as we have seen, is immediate in its self-identity; now when 
this immediacy is "deposed," Being is reduced to a reflected light, and 
essence is Being thus reflected on itself.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> As reflection supersedes 
immediacy, essence supersedes Being. The reflection is, however, to be 
conceived as inward in direction; for the outer "rind or curtain" is 
Being, and the inner reflection is essence. There is, therefore, a 
duality here, -- the categories of essence come in pairs, as, for 
instance, essence and appearance, force and expression, matter and 
form, substance and accident, cause and effect, -- a duality which, as 
we shall see, disappears in the <i>notion</i>, wherein the opposite 
aspects of Being attain final unity.<p>

First, we have <i>essence</i> and <i>appearance</i>. Immediate Being is 
now an appearance; yet it is not, as we should say, merely phenomenal, 
for it is the appearance of an essence, and it is as necessary that the 
appearance should have an essence as it is that the essence should 
appear. Life, for example, <i>must manifest</i> itself, the cause 
<i>must produce</i> an effect, and at the same time there is no 
manifestation of life without life and no production of an effect 
without a cause.<p>

Next, as determinations of essence we have <i>identity</i> and 
<i>difference</i>. The unity of these is the <i>ground (Grund)</i>, 
which is defined "the essence put explicitly in totality." At this 
point essence has completed the circle of self-mediation (reflection), 
so that we are back again at immediate Being, not at Being in its 
primitive immediacy, but at Being in an immediacy which results from 
the annulment of all intermediation. Being, which is immediate in this 
sense, is <i>existence</i>. Developing now the categories of ground and 
existence into an explicit unity, we arrive at the category of <i>thing 
(Ding)</i>. Thing in its relation to reflection on other things 
develops the category of <i>properties</i>; 
 <!--
570 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p570"></a>
 and the union of essence with existence, combining all the essential 
with the existential aspects of Being, gives the form of actuality, 
which is synonymous with <i>reality</i>.<p>

Similarly, by processes the details of which it is unnecessary to set 
down here, the categories <i>content</i> and <i>form</i>, <i>power</i> 
and <i>expression</i>, <i>inner</i> and <i>outer</i>, <i>substance</i> 
and <i>accident</i>, <i>cause</i> and <i>effect</i>, <i>action</i> and 
<i>reaction</i>, are deduced from essence. It is important, however, to 
note that as substance and accident, so cause and effect (and indeed 
all the categories which come under the head of essence and appearance) 
are inseparable. Cause passes over into effect, so that the effect is 
the cause explicated or manifested, and effect in turn passes over into 
cause. For the causal series is not a progress <i>ad infinitum</i>, the 
rectilinear movement from cause to effect being bent back on itself so 
as to form a circle in which every effect becomes the cause of its 
cause. This <i>reciprocity</i> is illustrated in history; for example, 
the character and manners of a nation influence its constitution and 
laws, while in turn the constitution and laws of a country influence 
the character and manners of its people.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> The category of reciprocity 
(<i>Wechselwirkung</i>) does away with the idea of predetermining 
fatality, shows that <i>freedom</i> is to be found in the concept of 
absolute but reciprocal necessity, and thus leads to the category of 
the <i>notion</i>.<p>

C. <i>Doctrine of the Notion</i>. The <i>notion (Begriff)</i> is 
"essence reverted to the immediacy of Being,"<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> or, since each 
category is inseparable from its antecedent, the notion is the 
principle of freedom, the power of substance self-realized. In fact, 
the notion contains all the earlier categories, and may therefore be 
defined as the truth of Being and essence. Obviously, then, we may 
understand the notion to be synonymous with totality fully realized, 
which is apparently what Hegel means when he says that quality, 
quantity, force, cause, necessity, freedom are nothing apart from the 
notion. The dialectical process of Being 
 <!--
HEGEL'S DOCTRINE OF THE NOTION 571
 --><A NAME="p571"></a>
 was <i>transition</i>, that of essence was <i>reflection</i>; the 
movement of the notion is merely <i>development</i>. It is, Hegel tells 
us, to be looked upon as play, for the other which it sets up is not 
really an other.<p>

Following this <i>play</i> of the notion we find that its triadic 
development is <i>subjective notion, objective notion</i>, and 
<i>absolute notion</i>, or <i>Idea</i>.<p>

a. <i>Subjective notion</i> is the notion as notion, and as such has 
three moments, -- <i>universality, particularity</i>, and 
<i>individuality</i>. The meaning is that the notion passes from unity 
to partition and thence back to the explicit identification of parts in 
the one. This reintegration is effected by means of <i>judgment 
(Urtheil)</i>, which, as its name implies, signifies the identification 
of partition with primary unity, so that the abstract form in which all 
judgments may be expressed is "The individual is the universal." Now 
judgment, inasmuch as it affirms the identity of the individual with 
the universal, contains a contradiction. This contradiction is removed 
in the <i>syllogism</i>. The syllogism is, therefore, the complete 
expression of the subjective notion, the reintegration of the 
partitions of the notion in the universal by means of the particular. 
"Consequently, at the present stage (in the deduction of the 
categories) the definition of the Absolute is that it is a syllogism, 
or, stating the principle in the form of a proposition: <i>Everything 
is a syllogism</i>."<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup><p>

b. <i>Objective notion</i>. Thus far the notion has been considered in 
its subjective stage, as it were in the abstract, as form without 
content; but since it is a form which, in its ultimate development, is 
a union of opposites, it constantly tends to objectify itself. The 
notion as object is the totality of objects, -- the universe.<p>

Here, as usual, we are to distinguish three forms: <i>mechanism</i>, or the 
juxtaposition of independent objects held together 
 <!--
572 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p572"></a>
 as an aggregate; <i>chemism</i>, or the mutual attraction, 
penetration, and neutralization of objects (elements) held together by 
affinity; and <i>organism</i>, or the complete unity of purposive 
action in which the independence of the objects (body cells) disappears 
and parts are made to serve the purpose of the entire structure.<p>

Now, notion become object implies a contradiction; for as subjective 
notion was form without content, so the object, as object, is content 
without form. The <i>play</i> of the notion has here reached a point 
where the notion is not a notion. The contradiction, however, 
disappears in the <i>Idea</i>, or absolute notion.<p>

c. <i>Absolute notion</i> is the truth in itself and for itself, the 
absolute unity of notion and objectivity. It may be defined as reason, 
subject-object, the union of the real with the ideal, of the body with 
the soul, etc. <i>It is essentially a process</i>. In its immediate 
form it is <i>life</i>. When it becomes its own object in the 
theoretical order, it becomes <i>the true</i>; when it becomes its own 
object in the practical order, it becomes <i>the good</i>; and when, by 
its theoretical and practical activity (the knowledge of the true and 
the pursuit of the good), it returns to itself from the bias and 
finiteness of cognition and volition, it becomes the <i>absolute 
Idea</i>. Life is defective, inasmuch as it is the Idea implicit or 
natural; cognition-volition is defective in so far as it is the Idea as 
merely conscious, and therefore one-sided; the absolute Idea unites the 
truth of life with the truth of consciousness, supplying the defect of 
the former and overcoming the one-sidedness of the latter. This is 
<i>the goal of the entire series of logical processes</i>; in its next 
phase <i> the Idea passes over into otherness and becomes nature</i>.<p>

Thus far we have followed the triadic developments of the Idea 
(reality, reason, the Absolute) through processes which in
 non-technical language may be styled the dialectic of the Divine 
Reason anteriorly to the creation of the universe. We come, in the next 
place, to the study of reason in nature. 
 <!--
HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE 573 
 --><A NAME="p573"></a><p>

2. <b>Philosophy of Nature</b>. <i>Nature is the Idea</i> (reason) 
<i>in the state of otherness</i>, -- a state intermediate between the 
immediacy of reason as notion and the reintegrated immediacy of reason 
as it fully realizes itself in spirit. In nature the Idea has become 
externalized and particularized; its unity has disappeared, or rather 
is concealed. Still, nature, while it is a state of the Idea, is also a 
process of spirit, and although the natural sciences are right in 
regarding phenomena as isolated realities, they do not fully exhaust 
the truth of nature, the very plurality of phenomena being a 
contradiction which of itself shows that nature is a process. 
<i>Philosophy</i>, therefore, taking a higher view point than that of 
science, <i>represents nature as a series of successful struggles</i> 
by which the Idea, scattered as it were in plurality, regains unity and 
self-identity (self-consciousness) in the individual spirit (man), 
which is the goal of the processes of nature. Exclude this concept of 
the upward struggle of nature, and natural phenomena become a tangled 
mass of events in inextricable disorder.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

There are three stages in the process which is nature, namely 
<i>mechanics</i> (matter and space), <i>physics</i> (bodies), and 
<i>organics</i> (life). In bodies, nature attains <i>individuality</i>; 
in living organisms, it attains <i>subjectivity</i>, or consciousness; 
it is only in man that it attains <i>self-consciousness</i> (self as 
subject and object). Man, however, while he is the highest product of 
the Idea in nature, is, like nature itself, subject to the law of 
development. No sooner, therefore, has the Idea become spirit by 
attaining self-consciousness in man, than it undergoes a further and 
final process of development as <i>subjective, objective</i>, and 
<i>absolute</i> spirit. This last process is the subject-matter of the 
philosophy of mind.<p>

The philosophy of nature has been pronounced the least original and the 
least consistent of the three portions into which Hegel's philosophy is 
divided. It underwent more modification 
 <!--
574 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p574"></a>
 at the hands of Hegel's pupils and successors than did the logic or 
the philosophy of mind. Yet even in its modified form the Hegelian 
philosophy of nature is far from being consistent with the principles 
of absolute idealism. Indeed, the supreme test of a system of 
metaphysics is its compatibility with the ultimate truth of empirical 
science, -- a test to which, it is safe to say, no system of idealism 
from the days of Parmenides to those of Hegel has consistently 
conformed. Not that the metaphysical point of view is not 
<i>different</i> from that of the physical sciences. There may, 
however, be difference without antagonism; for, as Hegel himself 
observes, "The philosophical way of presenting things is not a 
capricious effort, for once in a way to walk on one's head as a change 
from the ordinary method of walking on one's feet . . . , but it is 
because the manner of science does not <i>fully satisfy</i> that we are 
obliged to go beyond it."<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup><p>

3. <b>Philosophy of Mind</b>. <i>Mind</i> (spirit, Geist) <i>is the 
truth of nature</i>. Its formal essence is <i>freedom</i>, -- the 
absolute self-identity of the Idea. Mind, it is important to note, is 
the most complete development of the Absolute, so that when we say "The 
Absolute is Mind," we have the supreme definition of the Absolute.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> 
But although mind is absolutely the <i>prius</i> of nature, yet <i>for 
us</i> it comes out of nature, and therefore brings with it what may be 
called a germ of development. In this development we are to 
distinguish, as usual, three stages, -- <i>subjective mind, objective 
mind</i>, and <i>absolute mind</i>.<p>

A. <i>Subjective Mind</i>. If freedom is the formal essence of mind, 
consciousness is its material essence; for it is by successive steps 
towards complete self-consciousness that mind attains perfect freedom. 
Hegel agrees with Spinoza in teaching that  
 <!--
HEGEL'S DOCTRINE OF SUBJECTIVE MIND	575 
 --><A NAME="p575"></a>
 the emancipative acts of the soul are conditioned by advance in 
knowledge, -- a doctrine which does not surprise us when we remember 
that, in Hegel's view, thought is essentially dynamic, having, so to 
speak, a volitional as well as a cognitive phase. While mind was still 
immersed in nature, it took part in the planetary life of the universe, 
responding to the change of seasons, etc. Partially emerging from 
nature, it experienced in the first dull stirring of consciousness, 
namely <i>sensation (Empfindung)</i>, a kind of vague realization of 
itself as in and for itself; <i>feeling (das F&uuml;hlen)</i> succeeded 
sensation, and was in turn succeeded by <i>self-feeling 
(Selbstgef&uuml;hl)</i>, which is the ground of <i>consciousness 
(Bewusstsein)</i>. When it has reached this stage, mind, recognizing 
itself as an ego, has divested itself of nature. Next, as theoretical 
mind, it passes through the stages of <i>intuition (Anschauung), 
representation (Vorstellung)</i>, and <i>thought (das Denken)</i>. 
Having now <i>taken possession</i> (of its intuitions, representations, 
and thoughts), it proceeds, as practical mind, to determine its 
contents; this it does by means of <i>impulse (Triebe), desire 
(Begehren)</i>, and <i>inclination (Neigung)</i>, thus arriving at 
complete self-determination, which is freedom. Free will is, therefore, 
the union of theoretical and practical mind.<p>

"It was," Hegel remarks, "through Christianity that this idea (of 
actual freedom) came into the world. According to Christianity, the 
individual, <i>as such</i>, has an infinite value as the object and aim 
of divine law." The Greeks and Romans, he explains, maintained that 
freedom is an accident of birth, or is grounded in strength of 
character, or is acquired by education and philosophy, while 
Christianity on the contrary maintains that man as man is free.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Freedom</i>, once attained, must be realized, and, according to the 
universal formula of development, it must be realized through its 
opposite, necessity. It is for this reason that mind objectifies itself 
in law, the family, and the state. In this way, through 
 <!--
576 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
 --><A NAME="p576"></a>
 the discipline of necessity, the egotistic impulse becomes property 
<i>right</i>, sexual impulse becomes moral in marriage, and the 
inclination to revenge is transformed into punitive justice in the 
<i>state</i>.<p>

B. <i>Objective Mind</i>. The yoke of necessity, to which free will 
subjects itself in order to realize full freedom, is (a) <i>right 
(Recht)</i>, in which freedom attains outer actuality, (b) <i>morality 
(Moralit&auml;t)</i>, in which it attains inner actuality, and (c) 
<i>social morality (Sittlichkeit)</i>, in which it attains complete 
actuality, which is both inner and outer.<p>

a. From <i>right</i> springs ownership (<i>property</i>), and from 
ownership the right to dispose of one's possessions by <i>contract</i>. 
Now although contract refers primarily to individual property, it 
implies the merging of two wills in the common will. Hence arises the 
possibility of conflict between the will of the individual and that of 
the community. In this conflict consists <i>wrong (Unrecht)</i>, which 
it is the duty of the public authority to correct by <i>punishment</i>. 
In this way the idea of contract leads to the idea of the <i>state</i>.<p>

b. From morality spring <i>purpose</i> (the inner determination of the 
subject), <i>intention</i> (the subjective aim of the action to be 
performed, inasmuch as that aim is implied in the general wellbeing of 
the subject), and <i>good</i> and <i>evil</i> (the moral aspects of 
action). These determine the moral standpoint, the conscientious 
attitude, as we should call it, of the agent; however, they determine 
it so vaguely and unsatisfactorily that a conflict of apparent duties 
often results; for conscience is liable to error, and what is 
subjectively represented as good may be objectively evil. To right, 
therefore, and to morality must be added <i>social morality</i>. Right 
regulates merely the external, material interests of life; conscience 
is one-sided because it is subjective: <i>social morality, being at 
once objective and subjective, external and internal, is the complete 
realization of freedom through the discipline of necessity</i>. 
 <!--
HEGEL'S THEORY OF THE STATE 577  
 --><A NAME="p577"></a><p>

c. <i>Social morality</i>. In social moral life the individual 
recognizes that what he <i>ought</i> to do <i>is</i>; for his duty is 
presented to him in its objective concrete realization in the family 
and in the state. He is no longer subject to the uncertainty of 
selective reflection: he sees his duty and he is, as it were, 
constrained to fulfill it. It is by submitting to this restraint that 
he attains the fullness of freedom.<p>

The primary social moral institution is the <i>family</i>. It is the 
foundation of the state, and is, of its nature, permanent. Hegel was 
opposed to the principle of divorce, and would justify the granting of 
divorce only in exceptional cases provided for by law.<p>

<i>Civil society (die b&uuml;rgerliche Gesellschaft)</i> is the 
relative totality of individuals. It is different, on the one hand, 
from the family, for the family is an individual, and, on the other 
hand, from the state, for the state is a complete organic unity in 
which individuals, as individuals, do not exist. Civil society aims 
merely at the protection of individual interests; its mission is purely 
economic.<p>

<i>The State (Staat)</i> is the perfect social organization. It does 
not live for the individuals of which it is composed, but for the 
ethical idea which it embodies, individuals being merely means which, 
when occasion demands it, must be sacrificed, as all private interests 
must be sacrificed, for the good of the whole.<p>

Hegel, in treating of the state, takes up in succession 
<i>constitutional law</i> (the inner form of particular state 
organizations), <i>international law</i> (the outer form of states, 
which is regulative of the interrelations of states), and the 
<i>dialectics of history</i> (the laws of the general development of 
the universal mind, which manifests itself both in the internal 
constitution and in the outer forms of particular states).<p>

alpha. <i>Constitutional law (inneres Staatsrecht)</i>. The constitution is 
the articulation, or organization, of state power. From the point of 
view of the individual, the power of the state is a restriction. Still, 
inasmuch as it functions for the common 
 <!--
578 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
 --><A NAME="p578"></a>
 good, it is the substance of the volition of the individual. By nature 
men are unequal; but before the law, that is, by virtue of the 
principle of state organization, -- the merging of individual freedom 
in the objective mind, -- all men are equal. This, however, means that 
as abstract persons they are equal; for in the concrete there is no 
perfect equality, men being equal before the law only in so far as they 
are equal outside the law.<p>

The collective spirit of the nation is the constitution; the real 
living totality (the embodiment of the collective spirit) is the 
<i>government</i>, and although, according to the basic laws of 
organization, the government must divide its powers (legislative, 
judicial, and executive), it must, nevertheless, preserve the highest 
form of organic unity. For this reason a constitutional monarchy is 
superior to a republic on the one hand and to an absolute monarchy on 
the other hand. But while Hegel opposes the extension of 
<i>individualism within the state</i>, he is in favor of <i>the 
individualism of states</i> with respect to one another; for the state 
is based on the national spirit, and the national spirit is fostered by 
unity of language, customs, religion, etc. So long as a nation stands 
for a national ideal it is a crime, Hegel teaches, to annex it.<p>

beta. <i>International law (das &auml;ussere Staatsrecht)</i>, 
including treaty law and natural law, governs the relations of states 
to one another in time of peace and in time of war. War, Hegel teaches, 
is the indispensable means of political progress. It is a <i>crisis in 
the development of the Idea</i>, which is embodied in the different 
states, a crisis out of which the better state, that is the state which 
approaches more closely to the ideal, is certain to emerge victorious. 
For right is might; the better state conquers because it is better. 
Thus in every period of the world's history there has been some one 
chosen people, a nation which realizes more perfectly than any other 
the ideal of national life. This consideration leads to the next point, 
the dialectics of history. 
 <!--
HEGEL'S PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY 579  
 --><A NAME="p579"></a>
 gamma. <i>Dialectics of history</i>. Hegel's philosophy of history is, 
perhaps, the most important portion of his speculative system. In it we 
find the most intelligible application of the principle of development, 
which dominates the method and contents of the other portions of his 
philosophy. Indeed, Hegel as well as Schelling insisted that <i>the 
lower is to be understood by the higher</i>. The philosophy of history 
will, therefore, throw light on the philosophy of nature and on logic.<p>

The most general definition of the philosophy of history is that it is 
<i>the thoughtful consideration of history</i>.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> More specifically, 
the thought which philosophy brings to the study of history is the 
conception of a sovereign reason, of which the succession of historical 
events is a rational process. This is at once a postulate of history 
inasmuch as it is a demonstrated thesis of philosophy, and a conclusion 
of history inasmuch as it is a most obvious inference from the study of 
historical happenings. The "micrologist" admits the "peddling" of the 
idea of Providence, but denies its applicability to the process of 
history as a whole. We must not, Hegel observes, imagine God to be too 
weak to exercise His wisdom on the grand scale.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>History</i>, then, <i>is the process of reason as spirit</i>. 
Interest, passion, character, in a word, all the forces at play in the 
process, are a compound of will and intelligence. The
 <i>world-historical persons</i>, the great men of history, apparently 
drew the impulse of their lives from themselves; in reality, however, 
they were great because they "had an insight into the requirements of 
the time, -- <i>what was ripe for development</i>." They embodied the 
irresistible force of spirit in their own lives: they lived not for 
themselves but for the Idea which was their master passion. Their fate, 
therefore, was not a happy one.<p>

The development of the spirit in history aims at complete freedom; the 
process is, however, <i>not a tranquil growth, but a 
 <!--
580 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p580"></a>
 stern, reluctant working through opposition to complete 
realization</i>. Thus we have three stages, -- oneness, expansion, and 
concentration. The <i>Oriental monarchies</i> represented despotism, 
the <i>Grecian republics</i> represented the unstable equilibrium of 
democracy tending towards demagogic rule, and the <i>Christian and 
parliamentary monarchy</i> represents the reintegration of freedom in 
constitutional government. Here we have an ideal example of <i>thesis, 
antithesis</i>, and <i>synthesis</i>, -- the triadic movement which is 
the law of all development.<p>

Even in the highest and most perfect form of political organization, 
mind is limited, and though the necessity which the state imposes makes 
for ultimate freedom, yet it is necessity. Mind, therefore, having 
objectified itself in the state, must complete the circle of 
development by returning to itself, becoming identical with itself and 
subjecting itself to itself alone, as Absolute Mind in <i>art, 
religion</i>, and <i>philosophy</i>.<p>

C. <i>Absolute Mind</i> is the ultimate identification of mind with 
itself. Here mind subjects itself to itself, not as limited, but as 
infinite. There are three stages of Absolute Mind, -- <i>art, 
religion</i>, and philosophy.<p>

a. <i>Art</i>. In art, mind has an intuitive contemplation of itself as 
infinite in the objective actuality of the art material. According as 
the art material becomes more docile, less rebellious to the Idea, we 
have <i>architecture, sculpture, painting, music</i>, and 
<i>poetry</i>; this is at once the line of ascending perfection and the 
line of historical development.<p>

b. <i>Religion</i>. In religion, mind <i>feels</i> that the Idea is 
superior to all its finite and particular manifestations. Religion 
arises from poetry, the highest form of art; but it is, by its nature, 
a protest against the tendency of art to become pantheistic. Religion 
insists on the infinity of God and the finiteness of man, whereas the 
tendency of art is to deify man and represent God as human. 
Nevertheless, it is essential to religion to <i>represent</i> the 
infinite and finite as in some relation with each other. 
 <!--
HISTORICAL POSITION OF HEGEL 581 
 --><A NAME="p581"></a>
 Oriental religions exaggerated the idea of the infinite; Greek 
religion gave undue importance to the finite; Christianity, being a 
synthesis of both, <i>represents</i> the union of the infinite and the 
finite in the doctrine of the Incarnation, and represents all truth in 
the dogma of the Trinity by teaching, as far as representation can 
teach, the triadic development of immanent reason as <i>idea, 
nature</i>, and <i>spirit</i>. The intellectual content of Christianity 
is thus the same as that of philosophy: there is no supernatural truth 
(<i>gnosticism</i>). Religion, however, contains the truth in the form 
of symbols and representations. Philosophy, therefore, which contains 
the truth as reason, is superior to religion.<p>

c. <i>Philosophy is the unity of art and religion</i>. The infinite, 
which, as the beautiful, was rendered visible in art, and, as God, was 
made the object of representation and feeling in religion, is now, as 
the true, made the object of the thinking faculty in philosophy. 
Philosophy is, consequently, "the highest, freest, and wisest phase of 
the union of subjective and objective mind, and the ultimate goal of 
all development."<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. It is difficult to trace even in outline 
the influence which Hegel's philosophy exercised on the thought of his 
own and subsequent generations. Some of Hegel's contemporaries 
regarded his system of philosophy as the organic synthesis of all 
preceding speculation and the final form of philosophic thought. Others 
believed, and not a few still believe, that that system must be the 
foundation of all profitable speculation in the future. And when due 
allowance is made for the exaggerations which are inevitable whenever 
the cult of greatness attains, as in this instance it has attained, 
almost to the proportions of religious veneration, it cannot be denied 
that Hegel's was the mind which, in developing towards a more complete 
unity the elements of Kantian thought, took the most comprehensive 
synthetic view of the problems of philosophy, reached farthest and 
deepest into every department of knowledge, and found in the principle 
of development the bond best 
 <!--
582 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p582"></a>
 suited by reason of its simplicity and universal applicability to hold 
together the various elements of a system extending from the problems 
of logic to the analysis of religion. It is safe to say that no 
department of human knowledge has failed to feel the influence of 
Hegel's doctrines, or at least of his method. And this is due partly to 
the fact that his philosophy embodies the highest aspirations of the 
spirit of the nineteenth century, -- the spirit of <i>collectivism</i>, 
-- and partly to the fact that in his system of thought so large scope 
is assigned to the principle of development, which has so dominated the 
scientific as well as the philosophical thought of the century.<p>

But the very greatness of Hegel's plan, the vastness of the enterprise 
itself, was the surest guarantee of its ultimate failure. "The rational 
alone is real" is a formula which, as understood and applied by Hegel, 
means that there are no limits to the power of the thinking faculty. 
For whether we understand the "rational" to refer to the Infinite 
Reason of the Creator or to the finite reason of the creature, the 
conclusion is ultimately the same, -- that everything real is to be 
analyzed in terms of rational thought. How inadequate is this view of 
reality the reaction against Hegelianism has taught us by insisting on 
the importance of the non-rational, and how hopeless is the
 self-imposed task of this new <i>gnosticism</i> is proved by Hegel's 
concept of God, which is the least satisfactory portion of his 
philosophy. The attempt to bring all reality under a single formula may 
indeed be the ideal of philosophy, but it is certainly an ideal which 
is as unattainable in practice as is the dream of the world conqueror 
who would bring all the nations of the earth under the scepter of one 
monarch. The highest unification which the finite mind can effect will 
necessarily fall short of absolute unity; for it is not given to the 
human mind to grasp the totality of being and to find in one formula a 
<i>rationale</i> of all reality. No philosophical system can 
consistently claim to comprehend God; it may discover Him, but it must 
acknowledge that He and His ways are 
 <!--
REACTION AGAINST HEGELIANISM 583
 --><A NAME="p583"></a>
 inscrutable. <i>Philosophy must leave room for faith, and its last 
word must be the necessity of faith</i>. Gnosticism, as the modern 
world is just now realizing, is more irreligious than agnosticism.<p>

It was the <i>followers of Hegel</i> who first revealed to the 
religious world the true drift of Hegelianism. The so-called Hegelian 
<i>Leftists</i> developed the anti-Christian elements in Hegel's 
thought, while the <i>Rightists</i> maintained that the teaching of 
Hegel accords with Christian faith and the doctrines of the Church. To 
the Leftists belonged <b>Strauss</b> (1808-1874), author of <i>Das 
Leben Jesu</i>, <b>Bruno Bauer</b> (1809-1882), author of <i>Kritik der 
evangelischen Geschichte des Johannes</i> (not to be confused with F. 
C. Baur [1792-1860], head of the T&uuml;bingen School), 
<b>Feuerbach</b> (1804-1872), author of <i>Das Wesen des 
Christenthums</i>, and the socialist <b>Karl Marx</b> (1818-1883). To 
the Rightists belonged <b>G&ouml;schel</b> (1781-1861), 
<b>Rosenkranz</b> (1805-1879), professor at K&ouml;nigsberg, and
