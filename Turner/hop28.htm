<h2 align="center">SECOND PERIOD OF SCHOLASTICISM</h3>
<h3 align="center">Roscelin to Alexander of Hales (1050-1200)</h3><p>

<b>The Problem of Universals</b>. In the <i>Isagoge</i> of Porphyry, 
translated by Boethius, which until the thirteenth century was the 
common text-book of logic in the schools, the following passage occurs:<p>

<blockquote>
Mox de generibus et speciebus, illud quidem sive subsistant, sive in 
solis nudis intellectibus posita sint, sive subsistentia corporalia 
sint an incorporalia, et utrum separata a sensibilihus an in 
sensibilibus posita et circa haec consistentia, <i>dicere reeusabo</i>: 
altissimum enim negotium est hujusmodi et majoris egens 
inquisitionis.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> 
</blockquote>
  
This passage, which thrust the problem of universals on the 
philosophers of the Middle Ages, proposes three questions: (1) Do the 
universals (generic and specific concepts) exist in the world of 
reality, or are they merely things of the mind  
 <!--
266 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p266"></a>
 (<i>nuda intellecta</i>)? (2) If they do exist outside the mind, are 
they corporeal or incorporeal? (3) Do they exist <i>in</i> concrete 
sensible things or <i>outside</i> them? The <i>dicere recusabo</i> of 
Porphyry was a direct challenge to the schoolmen. Boethius in one of 
his commentaries had asserted the objective reality of universals, 
although in another commentary he had spoken as if he held that they 
are merely things of the mind.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> The early schoolmen were, therefore, 
thrown upon their own resources. Not having yet developed an adequate 
system of psychology, they were obliged to be content with an 
imperfect, and what may be called a provisional, solution of Porphyry's 
questions. Little by little, however, the problem of universals 
suggested questions of psychology and metaphysics, so that while it is 
incorrect to represent all Scholastic philosophy as centering around 
the problem of universals, it is true that it was this problem that 
occasioned the growth from the primitive form of Scholasticism to the 
Scholasticism of the age of perfection, although there were, as we 
shall see, other factors which contributed to this development.<p>

The answers to Porphyry's questions are generally classed under three 
heads: <i>nominalism, conceptualism</i>, and <i>realism</i>. Nominalism 
maintains that there is no universality either of concept or of 
objective reality, -- the only universality being that of the name. 
Conceptualism concedes the universality of the idea, but denies that 
there is a universality of things corresponding to the universality of 
the mental representation. Realism, in its exaggerated form, maintains 
that the universal as such exists outside the mind, -- in other 
words, that there are objective realities which, independently of our 
minds, possess universality; realism, in its moderate form, known as 
Aristotelian, or Thomistic, realism, while it grants that there is in 
things an objective, potentially universal reality, contends that the 
formal aspect of universality is conferred by the mind, and 
 <!--
THE PROBLEM OF UNIVERSALS 267 
 --><A NAME="p267"></a>
 that consequently the universal in the full panoply of its 
universality exists in the mind alone, having, however, a 
<i>fundamentum in re</i>. The formula which came to be the recognized 
watchword of the nominalist and conceptualist is <i>universalia post 
rem</i>; the formula of exaggerated realism is <i>universalia ante 
rem</i>. Moderate realism, in the spirit of true synthesis, maintained 
<i>universalia ante rem</i> (the types of things existing in the mind 
of God), <i>universalia post rem</i> (concepts existing in the human 
mind), and <i>universalia in re</i> (the potentially universal essences 
existing in things).<p>

In the first period of Scholastic philosophy Erigena and Fredegis 
advocated the exaggerated form of realism. The reason of this is not 
far to seek. The doctrine accorded with the pantheistic spirit of 
Erigena's philosophy; it offered the most obvious solution of certain 
dogmatic problems, such as that concerning the transmission of original 
sin; and its assumption of the perfect correspondence of mental 
representations with external things commended it to the uncritical 
spirit of an age of beginnings. It was for lack of a developed system 
of psychology that the age demanded a categorical answer to the 
question, Do universals exist outside the mind? When, therefore, Eric 
and others deny the objective existence of universals, they are to be 
classed not as nominalists or conceptualists, but merely as
 anti-realists, for, though they endeavor to find a positive answer to 
the question, <i>How do universals exist?</i> their solution of the 
problem is to be considered in its negative rather than in its positive 
aspect. Nominalism and conceptualism did not appear until the second 
period of Scholastic philosophy, and even then the treatment of the 
problem of universals was dialectical rather than psychological.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

It cannot be denied that some of the problems discussed by the later 
schoolmen were of a frivolous character; it is, however, a serious 
mistake to describe the problem of universals 
 <!--
268 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p268"></a>
 as a barren dispute, a controversy about over-refined subtleties. The 
denial of the universal means sensism, and leads incidentally to the 
denial of the abstractive power of the human mind. Moreover, the 
universal has its ethical as well as its psychological aspect, and the 
denial of the universal means ultimately the destruction of moral ideas 
and the subversion of the stability of moral principles. Consequently, 
the schoolmen are to be admired, not blamed, for attaching so much 
importance to the problem of universals. It is interesting to note that 
it was this problem that developed the Scholastic method, brought out 
the element of rationalism latent in Scholasticism, and led, as has 
been remarked, to the growth of Scholastic psychology and metaphysics.

PREDECESSORS OF ROSCELIN</h3><p>

Besides the anti-realists, Eric, Remi, etc., there were, before the 
days of Roscelin, dialecticians who opposed the prevailing spirit of 
realism. Du Boulay<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> mentions a certain "Joannes qui eamdem artem 
sophisticam vocalem esse disseruit." The authors of <i>L'Histoire 
litt&eacute;raire de la France</i> speak of the same teacher as Joannes 
Sophista. Oudin and Kaulich believe that Du Boulay refers to Erigena. 
It is more probable that the Joannes referred to is John the Deaf, 
otherwise called John the Physician.<p>

Herman, abbot of Tournai, writing in the first half of the twelfth 
century, says that in 1100 Raimbert of Lille and many others taught 
dialectic nominalistically. It is impossible that the school of 
Roscelin could have grown to such dimensions within half a century of 
its birth. Consequently, Roscelin must have had predecessors in the 
teaching of nominalism; he was not the founder of the system but rather 
its first great expounder and defender.<p>
