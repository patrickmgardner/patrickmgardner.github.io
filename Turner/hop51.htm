 --><A NAME="p432"></a>
<h3 align="center">CHAPTER LI<br>
THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT</h3><p>

The forerunner of the great scientific movement of the sixteenth 
century was <b>Nikolaus of Cusa</b> (1401-1464). Nikolaus was born at 
Kues, or Cusa, near Treves, in 1401. At an early age he joined the 
community of the Brothers of the Common Life at Deventer. Later he 
studied law, mathematics, and philosophy at Padua, but finally decided 
to abandon the legal profession and took holy orders. In 1448 he was 
made cardinal, and two years later was appointed to the see of Brixen. 
He died at Todi in Umbria in 1464. His most important works are the 
treatise <i>De Docta Ignorantia</i> and the dialogue entitled 
<i>Idiotae de Sapientia Libri Tres</i>. These were published at Paris 
in 1514 and at Basel in 1565.<p>

In his speculative philosophy Nikolaus occupies a position intermediate 
between Aristotelian and modern thought: he insists with special 
emphasis on the doctrine of the unity of opposites (<i>coincidentia 
oppositorum</i>) and on the principle that the beginning of true wisdom 
is the knowledge of one's own ignorance (<i>Docta Ignorantia</i>). 
Among his astronomical teachings is that of the rotation of the earth 
on its axis, -- a doctrine to which Copernicus subsequently gave 
scientific form.<p>

<b>Nicholas Copernicus</b> (1473-1543) was born at Thorn in Poland in 
1473. After studying at Cracow, Bologna, and Padua, he became canon of 
Frauenburg. In a treatise <i>De Orbium Celestium Revolutionibus</i>, 
which appeared in 1543 and was dedicated to Pope Paul III, he defended 
the heliocentric system of astronomy and definitely placed the earth 
among the solar planets.<p>

<b>Tycho Brahe</b> (1546-1601) furnished, by his accurate observations, 
materials for the work of Kepler.<p>

<b>Johann Kepler</b> (1571-1631) gave further development to the 
heliocentric hypothesis by discovering the form of planetary orbits and 
the laws of planetary motions.<p>

<b>Galileo Galilei</b> (1564-1642) taught the twofold motion of the 
earth and discovered the satellites of Jupiter and the laws of their 
motions.<p>

The discoveries of <b>Boyle</b> (1627-1691) and of <b>Newton</b>
 (1642-1727) were as important in the department of physics as were 
those of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo in the department of 
astronomy. All these, however, are of interest to the student of 
philosophy principally because of their effect on the course of 
speculative thought. 
 <!--
SCHOLASTICISM AND THE SCIENTIFIC MOVEMENT 433  
 --><A NAME="p433"></a><p>

<b>Influence of Scientific Discoveries on the Development of 
Philosophy</b>. The attitude which Catholic and Protestant theologians 
of the sixteenth century assumed towards the discoveries of Galileo and 
Kepler is well known. The antagonism, however, between the old and the 
new modes of thought resulted from a misunderstanding. There is no 
inherent contradiction between the broad principles of Aristotelian and 
Scholastic philosophy on the one hand and the new physics and astronomy 
on the other. Aristotle had advocated the investigation of nature, and 
the greatest of the schoolmen had insisted on the importance of 
building a science of nature on the basis of empirical knowledge. St. 
Thomas, in a remarkable passage, had acknowledged the possible advent 
of a theory which would subvert the entire structure of Aristotelian 
astronomy: in reference to the hypotheses (<i>suppositiones</i>) by 
which the ancient astronomers attempted to explain the irregularities 
of the motions of the planets, he had written:<p>

<blockquote>
Illorum autem suppositiones quas adiuvenerunt non est necessarium esse 
veras . . . quia forte secundum alium modum nondum ab hominibus 
comprehensum apparentia circa stellas salvatur.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

The Scholastics, therefore, who attacked the representatives of the new 
science were false to the principles of their school. Had they known 
and fully felt the spirit of Aristotelian and Scholastic philosophy 
they should have put an end to their fruitless discussions, shaken off 
the yoke of a false method, and gone forth with the representatives of 
the new science to investigate nature. They should have adopted as 
their motto "Anteire decet, non subsequi" and taken the lead in the 
advance guard of discovery. Instead of doing this, they antagonized 
science, so that when the new age, dominated by the scientific spirit, 
sought to found a system of metaphysics, it never for a  
 <!--
434 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p434"></a>
 moment considered that in the Aristotelian and Scholastic system of 
philosophy it already possessed the metaphysics which best accorded 
with the results of scientific discovery. When, therefore, we study the 
causes of the misunderstanding between science and Scholastic 
philosophy, we must lay the burden of the blame on the shoulders of the 
degenerate representatives of Scholasticism, who, by betraying at the 
critical moment of its history the great system which they were 
supposed to defend, did that system a wrong which all the efforts of 
their successors have not succeeded in righting. The discredit of 
Scholasticism was due not to a lack of ideas, but to a lack of men to 
set forth those ideas in the proper light. Moreover (if we are to 
vindicate Scholasticism at the expense of Scholastics), we must not 
overlook the dependence of the scientific movement itself on Scholastic 
philosophy. Humanism grew out of Scholastic soil, and owed more to 
Scholastic vigor and clearness of thinking than we are commonly aware 
of. The scientific revival also owes much to the learning of the 
schools. Columbus and Copernicus, who did more than any of their 
contemporaries to revolutionize modes of thought, appealed to their 
contemporaries on the strength of texts from Aristotle and Philolaus. 
It was by reasoning on the texts of Strabo and Ptolemy that Columbus 
convinced himself of the existence of a new country beyond the western 
ocean; and it was by meditating on the glory of God and on the spread 
of the Christian religion, which he deemed his special vocation in 
life, that the great mariner acquired the courage to brave the perils 
of unknown seas. We must keep these facts in mind, and not be too 
quick to regard the discoveries of this age as out of all relation with 
the past. Scientific discoveries form no exception to the law that 
thought flows in a continuous stream from one generation to another.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--
FRANCIS BACON 435

FRANCIS BACON<p>

<b>Life</b>. Francis Bacon was the first to attempt the construction of 
a system of empirical philosophy on the basis of the principles of the 
new scientific method. He was born in London in 1561. After studying at 
Cambridge he spent two years in Paris, as companion of the English 
ambassador. Returning to England, he adopted the legal profession. In 
1595 he entered Parliament, became adviser of the crown in 1604, and 
keeper of the Great Seal in 1617. In 1618 he was made lord chancellor, 
with the title of Baron Verulam, to which, three years later, that of 
Viscount St. Albans was added. He was charged, as is well known, with 
bribery and corruption, and, on pleading guilty to the accusations, was 
deprived of his office and fined &pounds;40,000. He died in 1626.<p>

DOCTRINES<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Bacon set himself the task of reorganizing all the branches of 
scientific knowledge, and with this purpose in view he proposed to 
expound a new method of scientific study and to treat of each of the 
sciences with special reference to the making of scientific and 
practical discoveries. The work in which this plan was to be realized 
is called the <i>Instauratio Magna</i>, of which the first part, 
entitled <i>De Dignitate et Augmentis Scientiarum</i>, treats of the 
reorganization of the sciences, and the second part, entitled <i>Novum 
Organum</i>, contains the theory of induction and of scientific method. 
To the sciences themselves, and to their application to discovery, 
Bacon contributed merely a portion of his projected work, descriptive 
of natural phenomena, and entitled <i>Historia Naturalis, sive Sylva 
Sylvarum</i>.<p>

<i>Philosophy</i> has for its object a knowledge of God, nature, and 
man. Our positive knowledge of God belongs to faith, for reason can 
give us merely a negative knowledge of God by refuting the objections 
urged against faith, and by showing the  
 <!--
436 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p436"></a>
 absurdity of atheism. "It is true," Bacon says, in a well known 
passage in his <i>Essays</i>, "that a little philosophy inclineth men's 
minds to atheism: but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to 
religion."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Bacon distinguishes first philosophy (<i>philosophia prima</i> or 
<i>scientia universalis</i>), which treats of the concepts and 
principles underlying all the parts of philosophy, and the philosophy 
of nature, which is subdivided into speculative and operative, the 
latter being defined as natural philosophy in its application to 
mechanics and other arts.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The first step towards attaining a knowledge of nature consists in 
purifying the mind by the exclusion of the phantoms, or idols, which 
interfere with the acquisition of knowledge. The idols, or false 
appearances, are reduced to four classes: (1) <i>Idols of the 
tribe</i>. These are common to all men, and are, in some way, derived 
from the very nature and limitations of the human mind. Such, for 
example, is the tendency to anthropomorphize. "For the mind," Bacon 
observes, "is not a plane mirror, but a mirror of uneven surface which 
combines its own figure with the figures of the objects it represents." 
(2) <i>Idols of the den</i>. These arise from the peculiar character of 
the individual. Some minds are naturally analytical, while others are 
naturally synthetical. To each belongs its own peculiar class of idols 
of the den. (3) <i>Idols of the market place</i>. These arise from the 
intercourse of men, and from the peculiarities of language. For words, 
Bacon warns us, are symbols of conventional value, and are based on the 
carelessly constructed concepts of the crowd. (4) <i>Idols of the 
theater</i>. These are false appearances arising from tradition and the 
authority of schools and teachers.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Having freed his mind from the false appearances of truth, the searcher 
after knowledge must next proceed to a personal  
 <!--
FRANCIS BACON 437
 --><A NAME="p437"></a>
 and <i>active investigation of nature</i>. He must not spin science 
from his own inner consciousness, as the spider spins its web from its 
own substance: he must, like the bee, collect material from the world 
around him and elaborate that material by the process of reflection and 
meditation. He must observe facts and proceed from the observation of 
facts to the establishment of laws and axioms. Bacon notes that the 
"inductia per enumerationem simplicem," of which alone Aristotle and 
the schoolmen treat, is "scanty and slovenly," because it is based on 
the observation of positive instances merely, and neglects to take 
<i>negative instances</i> into account, whereas induction should 
consider negative instances and instances of difference of degree as 
well as positive instances. These hints were taken up by John Stuart 
Mill, to whom we owe the four experimental methods of induction. The 
chief difference between the Aristotelian and the Baconian induction 
consists in this, that the former proceeds by <i>accumulation</i> of 
instances, while the latter is based on the <i>elimination</i> of
 non-typical instances and the discovery of decisive or "prerogative" 
instances.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In his effort to accentuate the importance of the inductive method of 
acquiring knowledge, Bacon committed the grave error of throwing 
discredit on the deductive, or syllogistic, process. Failing to 
recognize that each method has its use, he carried his hostility to the 
deductive method so far as to refuse to admit on deductive evidence the 
Copernican system of astronomy.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Little or nothing has been said of the 
contents of Bacon's philosophy. Indeed, it is by the method which he 
inaugurated, rather than by the content of his system of thought, that 
Bacon is to be judged. His attempts at personal investigation in 
accordance with the rules which he laid down were, for the most part, 
crude, and were far less successful than the experiments made by many 
of his contemporaries.  
 <!--
438 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p438"></a><p>

It was for a long time an axiom almost universally accepted that all 
the scientific progress made since the days of Bacon was due to the 
employment of the scientific method which he inaugurated. Recently, 
however, a more moderate view has begun to prevail. While it is 
conceded that Bacon deserves exceptional credit for having called 
attention to the necessity of an active investigation of nature, it is 
recognized also that he committed a serious mistake in discountenancing 
the use of deduction. It is historically demonstrable that the 
hypothetical anticipation of nature, by means of deduction, is as 
fruitful of scientific discovery as is the use of the inductive method, 
and Mill, with all his admiration for Bacon's method, acknowledges that 
no great advance can be made in science except by the alternate 
employment of induction and deduction. Descartes, who, as we shall see, 
advocated and used the deductive method, made more important 
contributions to natural science than did Bacon, the author of what has 
been called the scientific method.<p>
