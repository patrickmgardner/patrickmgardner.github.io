AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

The history of philosophy in America begins with <b>Jonathan 
Edwards</b> (1703-1758), a pupil of <b>Samuel Johnson</b>
 (1696-1772), who, during Berkeley's sojourn at Rhode Island, 
visited and corresponded with the distinguished advocate of 
immaterialism. Edwards was, however, influenced more by Locke than by 
Berkeley.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> In his principal work, which is devoted to the  
 <!--
AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY 635
 --><A NAME="p635"></a>
 discussion of the freedom of the will, he maintains that freedom, in 
the sense of self-determining power, is a contradiction, that true 
freedom (the quality of human action which raises it to the dignity of 
virtue) is a disposition of the heart, and that with this idea of 
freedom the foreknowledge and providence of God are easily reconciled. 
Edwards' <i>Works</i> were edited by S. E. Dwight (New York, 1844).<p>

The disciples of Edwards, chief among whom were <b>Jonathan Edwards, 
the Younger</b> (1745-1801), and <b>Timothy Dwight</b> (1752--1817), 
confined their attention for the most part to the problems of freedom 
of the will, the nature of virtue, and the principles of the moral 
government of the universe; they also endeavored to supply a rational 
basis for the Calvinistic system of theology.<p>

<b>Benjamin Franklin</b> (1706-1790) deserves mention among those who 
helped to stimulate an interest in philosophical speculation during the 
years that preceded the Revolution. The practical morality and the 
sagacious reflections of "Poor Richard" are Franklin's title to 
distinction as the "Socrates of America."<p>

At the beginning of the nineteenth century <b>James Marsh</b>
 (1794-1842) called attention to German speculation. He was succeeded 
by <b>William Ellery Channing</b> (1780-1842), one of the leaders of 
the Unitarian movement, from which sprang the New England 
transcendentalism represented by <b>Ralph Waldo Emerson</b>
 (1803-1882) and <b>Theodore Parker</b> (1810-1860).<p>

The Scottish philosophy was introduced into this country by <b>James 
McCosh</b> (1811-1894), who, after having taught logic and metaphysics 
at Queen's College, Belfast, came to America in 1868, and was appointed 
president of Princeton College in 1869. Dr. McCosh wrote <i>Intuitions 
of the Mind</i> (third edition, 1872), <i>Laws of Discursive 
Thought</i> (new edition, 1891), <i>First and Fundamental Truths</i> 
(1889), <i>Realistic Philosophy</i> (2 vols., 1887), etc. He opposed 
and criticised Kant, Hamilton, Mill, and Spencer, and advocated the 
common-sense philosophy, substituting the phrase "intuitions of the 
mind" for the expression "common sense."

 In the writings of <b>Noah Porter</b> (1811-1892), author of <i>The 
Human Intellect</i> (1868) and <i>The Elements of Intellectual 
Science</i> (1871), the doctrines of the Scottish school are modified 
by the introduction of elements from German transcendental 
philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The most distinguished representative of ontologism in America was 
<b>Orestes A. Brownson</b> (1803-1876), who was born at Stockbridge, 
Vermont. Brownson joined the Presbyterian Church at the age of 
nineteen; three years later he became a Universalist minister. In 1832 
he became a clergyman in the Unitarian Church, in 1836 he organized in 
Boston the Society for Christian Union and Progress, and finally in 
1844 he joined the Catholic Church. He died in 1876. In <i>Brownson's 
Quarterly Review</i>, of which the first number was published in 1844, 
he championed Catholic claims and discussed literary, philosophical, 
and political topics of interest at the time. His <i>Works</i> were 
published by his son, H. F. Brownson (10 vols., Detroit, 1882), who is 
also the editor of a little volume of extracts entitled <i>Literary, 
Scientific, and Political Views of Orestes A. Brownson</i> (New York, 
1893).<p>

Brownson distinguishes between intuition (direct perception) and 
reflection. The latter can contain nothing which is not first perceived 
directly by intuition: philosophy "begins and ends with thought. . . . 
Thought is, for us, always ultimate."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Now, "the careful analysis of 
intuitive thought discloses three elements: subject, object, and their 
relation, always distinct, always inseparable, given simultaneously in 
one and the same complex fact."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> This complex fact is "given" by the 
action of creation, -- <i>Ens creat existentias</i>, -- in which 
subject, object, and the activity of object are synthetically united. 
This is at once the <i>primum philosophicum</i> and the <i>primum 
psychologicum</i>: "That of which we have immediate intuition in every 
process 
 <!--
CATHOLIC PHILOSOPHY 637 
 --><A NAME="p637"></a>
 of reasoning and without which no such process would be possible or 
conceivable, is God the Creator."<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> "When Gioberti speaks of the ideal 
formula, defines it to be <i>Ens creat existentias</i>, and calls it 
the <i>primum philosophicum</i>, he speaks of the real, intuitive 
formula, not of the conceptual. He presents this formula as the 
<i>primum</i> both of things and of science."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Among the American representatives of Spencerian philosophy mention 
must be made of <b>Laurens P. Hickok</b> (1798-1888) and of <b>John 
Fiske</b> (1842-1901). The latter in his <i>Outlines of Cosmic 
Philosophy</i> (1874) presents in somewhat popular form the tenets of 
evolutionistic philosophy. The former represents an important attempt 
to modify the synthetic philosophy so as to render it more compact in 
its inherent consistency and more consonant with theistic ideas. For 
the Spencerian conception of the mind, as purely passive, Hickok 
substitutes the notion of a mind partly passive and partly active. The 
activity of mind is, in its cosmic aspect, the active reason of God, 
through Whose absolutely free self-limitation there have been created 
certain mechanical "forces" which constitute the "thing-in-itself," -- 
the external world prior to our consciousness of it.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>
