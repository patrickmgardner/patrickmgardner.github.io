THE IMPERFECTLY SOCRATIC SCHOOLS</h3><p>

Among those who felt the influence of Socratic teaching, there were 
some who failed to appreciate the full meaning of the doctrine of the 
master, and merely applied his moral precepts to practical questions; 
of these, the best known is Xenophon. There were two, Plato and 
Aristotle, who penetrated the speculative depths of Socrates' thought 
and developed his teaching into a broader and more comprehensive 
Socratic  
 <!--
THE MEGARIAN SCHOOL 85 
 --><A NAME="p85"></a>
 philosophy. There were still others who, addressing themselves to one 
or other point of the teaching of Socrates, developed that point in 
conjunction with some elements borrowed from the pre-Socratic schools. 
These latter are known as the <i>imperfectly Socratic philosophers</i>. 
The following is a conspectus of the imperfectly Socratic schools, 
showing their derivation:<p>

Socratic dialectics
<ul>
<li>Megarian or Eristic School (Euclid)  --  Eleatic element. 
<li>Elean School (Phaedo)  --  Eleatic element.  
</ul><p>

Socratic ethics 
<ul>
<li>Cynics (Antisthenes) -- borrowed from Gorgias. 
<li>Hedonists (Aristippus) -- borrowed from Protagoras.  
</ul><p>

<b>Megarian School</b>. The Megarian school, to which Euclid and Stilpo 
belonged, made Eleatic metaphysics the basis of a development of 
Socratic ethics.<p>

EUCLID<p>

<b>Life</b>. Euclid of Megara, the founder of this school, was a 
disciple of Socrates, and if the story told by Gellius<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> be true, was 
so devoted to his teacher that, at a time when all Megarians were 
forbidden under pain of death to enter Athens, he would often steal 
into that city in the obscurity of evening in order to sit for an hour 
and listen to "the old man eloquent."<p>

<b>Sources</b>. We have no primary sources of information concerning 
the Megaric school, and our secondary sources are few and 
unsatisfactory. Schleiermacher, however, has shown<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> that the 
philosophers alluded to in Plato's <i>Sophistes</i><sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> are the 
Megarians. If we make use of this passage of Plato, we have the 
following points of doctrine.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>The Starting Point</b>. The Megarians started with the Socratic 
doctrine of concepts. If intellectual knowledge is knowledge through 
concepts, then the concept represents that part of a thing which never 
changes. 
 <!--
86 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p86"></a><p>

<b>The Development</b>. Granted now that, as Parmenides taught, change 
and Becoming are inconceivable, it follows that the unchangeable 
essences which concepts represent, the bodiless forms (<b>asomata 
eid&ecirc;</b>), are the only reality, and that the world of
 sense-forms is an illusion. Connected with this denial of Becoming is 
the assertion that <i>the actual alone is possible</i>. For this we 
have the express testimony of Aristotle.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>The Doctrine of the Good</b>. The union of Socratic and Eleatic 
elements is further apparent in the Megaric doctrine of the good. The 
good, according to Socrates, is the highest object of knowledge. Being, 
too, as the Eleatics taught, is the highest object of knowledge. 
Euclid, therefore, considered himself justified in transferring to the 
good all that Parmenides had said about Being: the good is one, 
knowledge of the good is the only virtue, though called by various 
names, -- prudence, justice, etc. The good is immutable; it is 
insight, reason, God. It alone exists.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Eristic Method</b>. In order to defend their views the Megarians 
availed themselves of the indirect method of proof following in this 
the example of Zeno. This method consists in refuting the arguments or 
hypotheses of one's opponent and thus, indirectly, establishing one's 
own thesis. Later, however, the followers of Euclid exceeded all 
precedent in their use of this method of strife, and vied with the 
worst of the Sophists in captious quibbling.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. This one-sided Socraticism takes for its 
starting point the Socratic dialectic of concepts, which it develops in 
union with Eleatic doctrines by means of the method introduced by Zeno 
of Elea.<p>

<b>The Elean School</b>. This school, founded by Phaedo, the disciple 
of Socrates so often mentioned in the Platonic dialogues, is virtually 
a branch of the Megarian school. It was removed  
 <!--
THE CYNICS 87 
 --><A NAME="p87"></a>
 from Elis to Eretria by Menedemus (died about 270 B.C.) and was 
henceforth known as the <i>Eretrian school</i>. Its doctrines are 
practically identical with those of Euclid.<p>

<b>The Cynics</b>. The doctrines of the Cynics were developed from 
Socratic ethics which were combined with certain dialectical and 
rhetorical elements derived from the Eleatics and from Gorgias the 
Sophist.<p>

ANTISTHENES<p>

<b>Life</b>. Antisthenes, the first of the Cynics, was born at Athens 
about the year 436 B.C. Early in life he associated himself with the 
Sophists, becoming, according to Diogenes Laertius,<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> a disciple of 
Gorgias. When, therefore, after the death of Socrates, for whose 
teaching he had abandoned the company of the Sophists, Antisthenes set 
up a school of his own, he was merely returning to his old profession. 
The school which he established met in the gymnasium of Cynosarges, 
whence, according to some writers, comes the name of the school, 
although it is not less probable that the name was originally a 
nickname (<b>Kunes</b>) given to. the Cynics because of their
 well-known disregard for social conventionalities. Indeed, it is said 
that Antisthenes, who happened to resemble Socrates in personal 
appearance, imagined that he heightened the resemblance by perverting 
the Socratic doctrine of moderation and abstemiousness into something 
bordering on a savage indifference to everything decent. He must not, 
however, be held accountable for the extravagances of the later Cynics. 
Of these the best known are <b>Diogenes</b> of Sinope, <b>Crates</b>, 
<b>Menedemus</b>, and <b>Menippus</b>.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Our knowledge of the doctrines of the Cynics is derived 
entirely from secondary sources. Chief among these are <i>Diogenes 
Laertius, Stobaeus, Sextus Empiricus</i>, and some of the Church Fathers, 
such as <i>Clement of Alexandria</i>.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

The Cynics were opposed to all culture except in so far as culture may 
be made to foster virtue. They were likewise opposed to logical and 
physical inquiries, though they themselves could not wholly avoid such 
questions. They strove, however, to make their logic and physics 
subservient to the 
 <!--
88 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p88"></a>
 investigation concerning virtue, which they considered to be the 
paramount problem of philosophy.<p>

<b>Logic</b>. According to Antisthenes, definition is the expression of 
the essence of a thing. The only definition, however, which Antisthenes 
admits, is the setting forth of the component parts of a thing. The 
simple cannot be defined.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> He opposed the Platonic theory of ideas, 
using, it is said, the following argument: <b>&ocirc; Plat&ocirc;n, 
hippon men hop&ocirc;, hippot&ecirc;ta de ouch hor&ocirc;;</b> to which 
Plato is said to have answered, "What you say is true, for you possess 
the eye of the body with which you see the horse, but you lack the 
mental eye by which the concept of horse is perceived."<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Antisthenes, 
then, believed that the individual alone is real. From which it follows 
that identical judgments alone are valid: everything should receive its 
own name and no other: we may say man is human, or the good is good; 
but we may not say that man is good, whence, as Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> and 
Plato<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> expressly tell us, the Cynics concluded that contradiction is 
impossible, and that <i>all propositions are equally true</i>. The 
practical import of this <i>nominalism</i> is seen in the use which the 
Cynics made of the dialectical method of the Sophists.<p>

<b>Ethics</b>. According to Socrates, virtue is the highest good: 
according to Antisthenes, <i>virtue is the only good</i>, and vice is 
the only evil. Everything else -- riches, honors, freedom, health, 
life, poverty, shame, slavery, sickness, and death -- is indifferent. 
The greatest of all errors is to suppose that pleasure is good: "I had 
rather be mad," Antisthenes said, "than be glad."<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> Now, the essence 
of virtue is <i>self-control</i>, that is, independence of all material 
and accidental needs. Against all the needs of body and mind the Cynics 
strove to harden themselves by renouncing not only pleasure and 
comfort, but also family, society, and religion. <i>The virtuous man is 
truly wise</i>. He  
 <!--
THE CYRENAICS 89 
 --><A NAME="p89"></a>
 alone is godlike. Wisdom is an armor which no temptation can pierce, a 
fortress that cannot be assailed. Consequently, he who has once 
attained wisdom can never cease to be virtuous.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The philosophy of the Cynics is a one-sided 
development of Socratic teaching. The direction which this development 
took was due less to the logical exigencies of the Socratic premises 
from which it was deduced than to the peculiar character of the founder 
of the school. Antisthenes was by temperament narrow-minded and 
obstinate, impervious to culture, a man of strong will but of mediocre 
intellectual ability. He was, we are told, rebuked by Plato for his 
lack of polish. The ostentatious asceticism which he introduced 
degenerated, as time went on, into positive indecency, and it was not 
until Stoicism appeared and absorbed what was left of the Cynic school 
that mental culture was restored to its place in practical philosophy.<p>

<b>Cyrenaic School</b>. This school is called <i>Hedonistic</i>, from 
the prominence which it gave to the doctrine that pleasure is the only 
good; it is also called <i>Cyrenaic</i>, from the city of Cyrene where 
it first appeared.<p>

ARISTIPPUS<p>

<b>Life</b>. Aristippus, to whom the fundamental doctrines of the 
school are traced, was born at Cyrene about the year 435 B.C. This 
date, however, is by no means certain. Attracted by the personal 
character of Socrates, he went to Athens in order to become a member of 
the Socratic school; he had previously made acquaintance with the 
doctrines of the Sophists through the writings of Protagoras. After the 
death of Socrates, he taught in several cities; indeed, he seems to 
have spent a great part of his life wandering about without any fixed 
abode, although it is probable that in his old age he returned to his 
native city and there established his school. Among the disciples of 
Aristippus, the best known are his daughter <b>Arete</b> and his 
grandson <b>Aristippus the Younger</b>, or <i>the mother-taught</i>.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The history of the Cyrenaic philosophy, like that of 
the teaching of the Cynics, is based on secondary authorities, chiefly 
on the works 
 <!--
90 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p90"></a>
 of <i>Diogenes, Cicero, Sextus Empiricus</i>, and <i>Clement of 
Alexandria</i>. We possess none of the writings of the earlier 
Cyrenaics. Indeed, it is sometimes even questioned whether it was 
Aristippus, the founder of the school, or his grandson, the
 mother-taught, who first reduced the Cyrenaic doctrines to a 
system.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

The attitude of the Cyrenaics towards the study of logic and physics 
was one of hostility. They agreed with the Cynics in regarding all 
speculation as idle, unless it had reference to the study of ethics, by 
which the happiness of man is secured, but they differed from them in 
their attempt to define the nature of happiness. For the Cynic, virtue 
is the only happiness; for the Cyrenaic, pleasure is a good in itself, 
and virtue is good only as a means to enjoyment.<p>

The central doctrine of Hedonism is, therefore, that pleasure and 
<i>pleasure alone constitutes the happiness of man</i>. For, the 
Cyrenaic argued, after the manner of Protagoras, "that is true which 
seems to be true: we can know only the feelings or impressions which 
things produce upon us; of things in themselves we can know nothing." 
The production, therefore, of certain feelings is all that we can 
accomplish by action. Consequently, that is good which can produce in 
us the most pleasant feelings.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Pleasure was defined by the Cyrenaics as <i>gentle motion</i>. It is, 
however, at least an inaccuracy on Cicero's part when he says that by 
pleasure the Cyrenaics understood mere bodily pleasure. Aristippus 
explained his pleasure doctrine in terms which are descriptive of 
mental emotion as well as of bodily enjoyment. It is true that the 
Cyrenaics spoke of pleasure as consisting in gentle motion. Our word 
<i>emotion</i> would, perhaps, convey their meaning much better than 
the word commonly employed. On  
 <!--
THE CYRENAICS 91 
 --><A NAME="p91"></a>
 the other hand, it must be admitted that, according to Cyrenaic 
principles, all pleasure is conditioned by bodily pleasure, or at least 
by organic states. This is implied in the theory of knowledge which the 
Cyrenaics derived from the teaching of Protagoras. We must be careful, 
moreover, to distinguish between the Hedonism of Aristippus, who by 
"pleasure" denoted a passing emotion, and the Hedonism of his later 
followers, who understood by "pleasure" something akin to the Epicurean 
notion of a state, or permanent condition, of <i>painlessness</i>.<p>

Pleasure, then, is the only good. Knowledge, culture, and even virtue 
are desirable only as means by which pleasure is attained. Virtue 
restrains us from that excess of emotion which is passion: passion, 
being violent, is painful and, on that account, to be avoided.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> We 
should possess our pleasures without being possessed by them: 
<b>ech&ocirc; ouk echomai</b> as Aristippus said. So, too, a man of 
sense will obey the laws of the country and conform to the usages of 
society because he judges that his failure to do so would result in a 
preponderance of pain over pleasure.<p>

Diogenes Laertius<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> gives an account of the later Cyrenaics who, like 
Theodorus and Hegesias, deemed it necessary to tone down the crudities 
of Hedonism as taught by Aristippus. Theodorus maintained that man's 
highest happiness is a state of <i>cheerfulness</i> (<b>chara</b>), 
while Hegesias, called the <i>Death-Persuader</i>, taught that the aim 
of man's actions should be to attain a state of indifference to all 
external things. In this final form it was easy for Hedonism to pass 
over into the Stoic school.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The development of the Cyrenaic philosophy, 
like that of the Cynic doctrine, was due more to the personal 
character of the founder of the school and to the social atmosphere of 
the city where the school was founded than to the requirements of the 
Socratic system from which it arose. Socrates, it is true, taught that 
happiness is the aim of action (<i>eudaemonism</i>), but the doctrine 
that happiness consists in momentary 
 <!--
92 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p92"></a>
 pleasure is Socraticism woefully perverted. "Know thyself" was the 
gist of Socratic teaching. "Yes, know thyself," taught Aristippus, "in 
order that thou mayest know to what extent thou canst indulge in the 
pleasures of life without exceeding the limit where pleasure becomes 
pain." The application is, surely, more in accord with the 
materialistic subjectivism of the Sophists than with the Socratic 
principles from which the Cyrenaic philosophy claimed to be derived.<p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. The imperfectly Socratic schools grew up side by 
side, without any affiliation to one another. They are thus relatively 
independent, each carrying out along its own line of development some 
point of Socratic teaching. They are essentially incomplete, because 
they are based on an imperfect understanding of the spirit of Socratic 
philosophy. Still, their influence, immediate and mediate, on 
subsequent thought must not be underestimated. The Megarians, in their 
doctrine of bodiless forms, foreshadowed the Platonic theory of Ideas, 
and both Antisthenes and Aristippus influenced the Platonic doctrine of 
the highest good. But important as was their immediate influence, the 
mediate influence of these schools was still more important. The age of 
Socrates was one that called for great constructive efforts; it was an 
age that could appreciate Plato and Aristotle, rather than Aristippus 
and Antisthenes. Later, however, there came a time when the political 
condition of Greece was such that men could well be persuaded to 
withdraw from the world of sense, from the problems of Being and 
Becoming, in order to adopt a self-centralized culture as the only 
means of happiness. It was then that the influence of the imperfectly 
Socratic schools was felt. The Stoa adopted substantially the moral 
teachings of the Cynics, the Scepticism of Pyrrho and the Academies 
sprang from the doctrines of the Megarians, while the school of 
Epicurus renewed hedonistic ethics by teaching a system identical in 
its principal tenets with the philosophy of the Cyrenaics. 
 <!--
LIFE OF PLATO 93 
 --><A NAME="p93"></a><p>

There is thus no continuity of development through these intercalary 
schools to Plato and Aristotle. Plato, entering into the spirit of 
Socratic philosophy more fully than the imperfect disciples had done, 
expanded the Socratic doctrine of concepts into the theory of Ideas, 
and gave to Socratic ethics a broader foundation and a more enduring 
consistency.<p>
