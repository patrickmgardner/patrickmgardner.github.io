204 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p204"></a>
<h3 align="center">CHAPTER XX<br>
NEO-PYTHAGOREANISM AND NEO-PLATONISM</h3><p>

During the Greco-Oriental period of its history philosophy seemed to 
turn to the supernatural for light and assistance. While, however, 
Philo sought to supply this supernatural element by bringing to bear on 
philosophical problems the whole wealth of Jewish religious ideas,
 Neo-Platonism looked for supernatural light, not in any system of 
religion, but in such communication with the Divine as each man may, by 
his own individual effort, attain. Neo-Platonism was, therefore, the 
last effort which pagan philosophy made to save itself from 
dissolution.<p>

In the Neo-Platonic movement we may distinguish <i>(1) the transition 
schools; (2) Neo-Platonism in its earlier form; (3) the Syrian school, 
(4) the school of Constantinople; (5) the Athenian school; (6) the 
Alexandrian school</i>.<p>

1. <b>Transition Schools</b>. The way was prepared for the Neo-Platonic 
movement by Neo-Pythagoreans and Pythagorizing Platonists who, before 
the time of Plotinus, agreed in admitting that philosophical knowledge 
is to be supplemented and perfected by communication with a more or 
less vaguely defined transcendent, divine something.<p>

The chief Neo-Pythagoreans were <b>Figulus</b> (45 B.C.), of whom 
Cicero speaks; <b>Apollonius of Tyana</b> and <b>Moderatus of 
Gades</b>, both of whom lived in Nero's time; and <b>Nicomachus of 
Gerasa</b>, who lived in the time of the Antonines.<p>

The philosophy of the Neo-Pythagoreans is a blending of Pythagorean 
traditions with Platonism, Aristotelianism, and Stoicism. The
 Neo-Pythagoreans taught a highly spiritual notion of God, in 
accordance with which they interpreted the numbers and the Ideas of 
their predecessors to mean Ideas in the mind of God. They attached 
great importance to the spiritual element in human life, to <i>mysticism, 
ecstasy</i>, and <i>prophecy</i>, and around the 
 <!--
PLOTINUS 205 
 --><A NAME="p205"></a>
 lives of Pythagoras and Apollonius they threw a halo of superturalism, 
exalting these philosophers into ideals of human conduct, into prophets 
and servants of God.<p>

Of the <i>Pythagorizing Platonists</i>, the best known are <b>Eudorus 
of Alexandria</b> (died about 25 B.C.), <b>Thrasyllus</b> (died A.D. 
36), <b>Plutarch</b> (A.D. 50-125), <b>Maximus of Tyre</b> (end of 
second century), <b>Celsus</b> (about A.D. 200), the opponent of 
Christianity, and <b>Numenius</b> (end of second century). To this 
school belong also the so-called Hermetic books, the writings of the 
pretended <b>Hermes Trismegistus</b>, which date from the latter part 
of the third century, and come apparently from an Egyptian branch of 
the school.<p>

All these writers manifest an inclination on the part of the Platonists 
to admit the religious ideas of the East as supplementary of 
philosophy. They lay stress on the antagonism between the spiritual 
and the carnal in man, between the spiritual and the material in the 
universe, and in order to bridge over the chasm between these 
antithetical elements they admit the existence of creatures 
intermediate between God and the material world.<p>

2. <b>Neo-Platonism in its Earlier Form</b>. <b>Ammonius Saccas</b> 
(A.D. 176-242) of Alexandria is regarded as the founder of
 Neo-Platonism. He did not commit his teachings to writing. It is to 
his disciple, Plotinus, that we owe the first written exposition of his 
system.<p>

PLOTINUS<p>

<b>Life</b>. Plotinus, a native of Lycopalis in Egypt, lived from 205 
to 270. In 253 he went to Rome, and there won over to his philosophy 
the Emperor Gallienus and his wife Salonina. In 263 he retired to 
Campania, where he died six or seven years later.<p>

<b>Sources</b>.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> The works of Plotinus consisted originally of
 fifty-four opuscles. After having, as some maintain, undergone a 
previous recension at the hands of Eustochius, these opuscles were 
collected by Porphyry and arranged, according to subject-matter, in six 
<i>Enneads</i>.  
 <!--

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>General Character of Neo-Platonism</b>. The Neo-Platonists made use 
of the <b>agrapha dogmata</b>,<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> and, in general, were more influenced 
by Platonic tradition than by the teaching of the <i>Dialogues</i>. In 
this way they were led to accentuate more and more the <i>mystical 
element</i> in human thought, to <i>separate matter from spirit</i>, 
and to have recourse to the doctrine of <i>emanations</i>.<p>

The philosophy of Plotinus centers round three ideas, -- the 
<i>One</i>, the <b>Nous</b>, and the <i>world-soul</i>, -- which for 
him constitute a kind of philosophical trinity.<p>

<b>The One</b>. Plotinus, like Philo, starts with the notion of God. 
God is described as the One, the Good, rather than as Being or Mind; 
for He transcends all Being, and all rational nature. He is the Primal 
Reality; therefore, He is not properly styled lntelligence, because 
intelligence (<b>Nous</b>) implies two elements, the act of knowing and 
the object known, and duality cannot be primal, because it presupposes 
unity. God, therefore, is absolute unity, undifferentiated by any act 
of His will or intellect, or by any predication on our part except the 
predication of unity and goodness. But goodness leads to emanation, 
which is at least an apparent breaking up of the unity of the One into 
the multiplicity of the manifold. Plotinus, however, explains that 
created things come from the Primal One, not by a transference of part 
of the nature of the One, nor by an act of will, but by a process 
called emanation. The process, then, is not one of creation; nor is it 
a process of emanation in the pantheistic sense; it is an overflow of 
the perfection of the One Supreme Reality, a beam sent forth from the 
Infinite Light, -- and with these metaphorical expressions Plotinus 
seems to have contented himself, being unable to describe more 
definitely the nature of the process of emanation.<p>

<b>Intellect</b>. The first emanation from the One is that of the 
<b>Nous</b>. The One sheds around itself an <b>ousia</b>, or essence, 
which, 
 <!--
PLOTINUS 207  
 --><A NAME="p207"></a>
 like a light, conveys the luster of the One, and is also its image. 
The image, turning to the One, recognizes itself as an image; thus does 
the essence become intellect, a dual principle, the source of all 
subsequent differentiation of the One.<p>

The intellect is, like the Logos of Philo, the <i>agglomerate of 
Ideas</i>: it is, indeed, expressly identified by Plotinus with 
Plato's world of Ideas. Now, the Ideas are differentiated in the 
intellect by an act of reflection, precisely in the same way as the 
intellect differentiated itself from the One by an act of reflection. 
But the act of reflection, while it distinguishes the Ideas in the 
intellect, does not dissociate or separate them from it. They sever 
themselves, because they are essentially operative powers. By this 
separation they give rise to the world of phenomena, not, indeed, 
immediately, but through the further mediation of the world-soul.<p>

<b>The World-Soul</b>. As the <b>Nous</b> is an image of the One, the 
world-soul is an image of the <b>Nous</b>. Being the image of an image, 
it is, as it were, doubly dual. In fact, while it is in part akin to 
the intellect, it is in part unlike the intellect, for it is in part 
essentially inclined to realize the Ideas in concrete phenomena.<p>

However, before we come to the material phenomenon there is still 
another step, another intermediate emanation. The world-soul gives rise 
to individual souls, or, more properly, to <i>plastic forces</i> 
(<b>logoi spermatikoi</b>); these in turn give rise to <i>matter</i>, 
with which they combine to constitute material phenomena. 
<i>Matter</i>, therefore, emanates from the <i>plastic forces</i>, 
which emanate from the <i>world-soul</i>; the world-soul, as we have 
seen, emanates from <i>intellect</i>, and intellect emanates from the 
<i>One</i>. In this way, light, in the series of emanations, becomes 
darkness; for matter is the antithesis of the One. Matter is 
multiplicity, change, not-being, privation, the <i>source of all 
evil</i>, the <b>pr&ocirc;ton kakon</b>. It is present everywhere in 
the world of phenomena in composition with the plastic forces, 
 <!--
208 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p208"></a>
 in the heavens, where it is united with a most perfect soul; in the 
stars, where it is united with the visible gods; in the powers of air 
and sky, where it is united with the demons, who mediate between the 
stars and the souls of men; in the body of man, where it is united with 
the human soul; and in inorganic bodies, where it is united with the 
lowest of the plastic forces. Wherever it is present, it is the 
principle of imperfection, limitation, and evil.<p>

<b>Psychological Doctrines</b>. Man is, therefore, a compound of matter 
and that plastic force which is the human soul. The soul is immaterial: 
it existed before its union with the body; it was united to the body in 
punishment for some primordial guilt. It survives the body, but is 
liable to be sent back into the bodies of animals or plants according 
to the degree in which it attached itself to material things during its 
union with the body. This doctrine of future retribution implies 
freedom on the part of the soul, and Plotinus maintains the doctrine of 
freedom in opposition to the teaching of the Stoics.<p>

<b>Return of the Soul to God</b>. Plotinus, following Plato, attaches 
little importance to the senses as means of acquiring knowledge of 
reality. In order to attain a knowledge of the ideal, which alone is 
real, the soul must retire into itself, and there contemplate the 
intellect which is indwelling in each of us. Proceeding along this path 
of self-contemplation, the soul rises from the contemplation of the 
intellect within us to a <i>contemplation of the One</i>. This final 
step is not, however, to be attained unless the One Himself sheds upon 
the soul a special light whereby the soul is enabled to see the One. In 
the splendor of that light all apprehension and all consciousness 
disappear; the soul is rapt in <i>ecstasy</i> (<b>ekstasis</b>) and is 
reunited with the One whence all things have emanated. This ecstasy is 
the supreme happiness of man.<p>

It is, therefore, man's duty first to withdraw from the world of sense 
by a process of <i>purification</i> (<b>katharsis</b>) then, freed from 
 <!--
THE SYRIAN SCHOOL OF NEO-PLATONISM 209  
 --><A NAME="p209"></a>
 the bonds of sense, to rise in contemplation to God, and thus beome 
truly spiritual, the man of God, the prophet, the wonder-worker 
(<b>thaumatourgos</b>).<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The philosophy of Plotinus is an elaborate 
attempt to bring the transcendent spiritual element of religion into 
harmony with the philosophy of Plato, or, more correctly, with the 
philosophy of the Platonists. Plotinus the pagan attempted to 
accomplish what Philo the Jew had attempted to accomplish two 
centuries before. He imagined that by his doctrine of emanations he 
had bridged over the chasm between the One and the world of
 sense-phenomena. But, like all monists, he was doomed to failure. His 
exclusion of volition and thought from the concept of the Deity 
forbade the introduction of a principle of differentiation; he could 
not consistently maintain the origin of the multiple from the One.<p>

Among the disciples of Plotinus, <b>Porphyry</b> (A.D. 233-304) is best 
known on account of his treatse, <b>Eisag&ocirc;g&ecirc; eis tas 
kat&ecirc;gorias</b>, an introduction to the logic of Aristotle. It was 
he who reduced the works of Plotinus to their present form. His 
exposition of the doctrines of Plotinus contains some material 
additions to his master's teaching in regard to questions of 
<i>asceticism, the use of magic</i>, and <i>the worship of demons</i>.<p>

3. <b>Syrian School</b>. <b>Iamblichus</b> of Syria (died about A.D. 
330), pupil of Porphyry, developing the mystico-religious ideas of the 
Neo-Platonists, elaborated a systematic <i>defense of polytheism</i>. 
Above the One he places the absolutely first; the <b>Nous</b> he 
divides to an intelligible and intellectual, each of which he 
subdivides to triads: these are the superterrestrial gods. The 
terrestrial gods he divides into three hundred and sixty celestial 
beings, twenty-two orders of subcelestial and forty-two orders of 
natural gods. Inferior to these are angels, demons, and heroes.<p>

Iamblichus endeavored to introduce the worship of Pythagoras, writing 
for this purpose a life of Pythagoras, full of legend and fable,  --  
<b>peri tou Puthagorikou biou</b>.
 <!--

4. <b>School of Constantinople</b>. After the failure of the Neo-
Platonic attempt to restore pagan philosophy, an attempt which received 
the imperial sanction of Julian (who reigned from A.D. 361 to 363), the 
Neo-Platonists went back once more to the works of Plato and Aristotle, 
inaugurating an era of more eager study and more elaborate exegesis of 
the writings of these great masters. At Constantinople, under the 
patronage of the Christian emperors, <b>Themistius</b> devoted himself 
to the task of commentating the works of Aristotle. Though he remained 
a pagan, Themistius was obliged to make concessions to the Christian 
religion, which was just then emerging victorious from its struggle 
with pagan civilization. Constantinople, however, did not long remain 
the center of the new movement; its place was taken by Athens, which 
once more became the focus of the Hellenistic philosophy, and 
Constantinople disappeared from the history of philosophy, to reappear 
in Byzantine times.<p>

5. <b>Athenian School</b>. About the beginning of the fifth century a 
new school of Platonism arose in Athens. Its chief representatives were 
<b>Plutarchus, Syrianus</b>, and <b>Proclus</b>.<p>

<b>Proclus</b> (A.D. 410-485) endeavored by means of Aristotelian 
dialectic to synthesize and systematize the Neo-Platonic doctrines. He 
retained the essential elements of Neo-Platonism, -- monism, doctrine 
of the <b>Nous</b>, emanation, antithesis of matter and spirit, 
mysticism, belief in demons, magic, etc. The principle on which he 
endeavored to unify all these was that of <i>triadic development</i>. 
That which is produced is similar to that which produces it; at the 
same time it differs from it, as the derivative differs from the 
original. By reason of its difference from the original, the derivative 
differentiates or produces; while by reason of its identity with the 
original, it tends to return to it. Thus we have the original, the 
emergence from the original, and the return (in a lower form) to the 
original, <b>mon&ecirc;, proodos, epistraph&ecirc;</b>, --  the three 
stages of the triadic development. 
 <!--
THE ALEXANDRIAN SCHOOL OF NEO-PLATONISM 211 
 --><A NAME="p211"></a><p>

The Absolute Original is the One, superior to all created unity, to all 
being, to all knowledge. From the One come, by the first emanation, the 
<i>henades</i> (<b>henades</b>). They alone are related to the world; 
they are the supreme gods; it is they who exercise providence over 
worldly affairs. Next, from the henades come, by a second emanation, 
the <i>triad</i>, intelligible, intelligible-intellectual, and 
intellectual being, having for chief properties being, life, and 
thought. Each member of the triad is further differentiated into a 
<i>hebdomad</i>; a series is thus formed, of which each member 
corresponds to one of the divinities of the pagan pantheon.<p>

The most important point of difference between Proclus and Plotinus is 
in the doctrine of the origin of matter. According to Proclus, matter 
is derived immediately from the unlimited, the first of the 
intelligible triads; according to Plotinus, on the contrary, matter is 
derived from the plastic forces and thus ultimately, through the
 world-soul and the intellect, from the One.<p>

Proclus maintained that the duty of man is to rise from the sensuous to 
the supersensuous, in the hope of reaching the <i>mystical union with 
God</i> which constitutes supreme happiness. Like Plotinus, he believed 
that such a union is impossible without a special illumination from on 
high, and he advocated as means of attaining this illumination, all the 
religious helps -- magic, demon worship, hero worship -- which a 
decadent paganism could offer.<p>

It was Proclus who gave to Neo-Platonism its final and most complete 
form. His successor, Simplicius, is more important as a commentator 
than as an independent thinker.<p>

6. <b>Alexandrian School</b>. Among the pupils of Proclus was 
<b>Ammonius</b>, who taught at Alexandria during the fifth century. 
With him are associated the names of <b>Damascius, John Philoponus</b> 
(sixth century), <b>Simplicius</b>, and <b>Olympiodorus</b>. It was at 
Alexandria that <b>Hypatia</b>, during the first decade of the fifth 
century, attempted to restore pagan philosophy. After her time, 
 <!--
212 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p212"></a>
 Philoponus and Olympiodorus, the last representatives of
 Neo-Platonism in the East, became converts to Christianity, and the 
warfare so long waged between the new religion and the old philosophy 
came to an end: pagan Platonism gave way before the Platonism of the 
Christian Church.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Neo-Platonism is Platonism in the condition 
of senile debility. The contrast between Plato and Proclus is 
sufficient to show that philosophy degenerated rather than developed in 
its unequal struggle with the new religion. And the degeneracy was not 
confined to the speculative portion of Plato's philosophy. That it 
extended also to ethics is manifest from the substitution of the 
practice of magic for the practice of virtue.<p>

What prolonged the life of Neo-Platonism was the opposition of the 
pagan world, and especially of the learned world of paganism, to 
Christianity. When (A.D. 529) Justinian forbade the teaching of 
philosophy at Athens, the Platonists emigrated to Persia. Thirty years 
later there was no Platonism outside the Christian Church.<p>

Neo-Platonism is the last phase of pagan philosophy. Although the most 
important systems of Neo-Platonism fall within the Christian era, they 
belong in spirit and in contents to the pagan world. With the history 
of Neo-Platonism, therefore, the history of ancient philosophy comes to 
an end.<p>
