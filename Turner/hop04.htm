HERACLITUS 53 
 --><A NAME="p53"></a>
<h3 align="center">CHAPTER IV<br>
LATER IONIAN PHILOSOPHERS</h3><p>

These are separated from the Earlier Ionian philosophers not merely in 
point of time but also in respect to doctrine. The difference consists 
chiefly in the tendency which the Later Ionians manifest to depart 
from the monistic dynamism of the early physicists and adopt a 
dualistic mechanical concept of the universe. Heraclitus, who is, in 
ultimate analysis, a dynamist, marks the beginning of the change which, 
after the more or less hesitating utterances of Empedocles, appears 
successively in the mechanism of the Atomists and in the openly 
pronounced dualism of Anaxagoras. Heraclitus is, therefore, the 
connecting link between earlier and later Ionian philosophy.<p>

HERACLITUS<p>

<b>Life</b>. Heraclitus, surnamed the Obscure (<b>ho skoteinos</b>) on 
account of the mist of oracular expressions in which (purposely, 
according to some writers) he veiled his teachings, was born at Ephesus 
about the year 530 B.C. He composed a work <i>peri phuse&ocirc;s</i>, 
consisting of three parts,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> the first of which was <b>peri tou 
pantos</b> the second, <b>(logos) politikos</b> and the third, 
<b>(logos) theologikos</b>. Of the fragments which have come down to 
us, very few can be assigned to the second of these parts, and fewer 
still to the third. The existing fragments offer considerable 
difficulty in the matter of arrangement and interpretation, a 
difficulty which is increased by the fact that many of our secondary 
authorities are untrustworthy. The doctrines of Heraclitus resemble the 
fundamental tenets of the Stoics, and here as elsewhere the stoic 
historians are inclined to exaggerate such resemblances. On this 
account, even for modern scholars, Heraclitus is still the Obscure.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Besides the fragments above mentioned, we have as 
sources of information the writings of Plato and Aristotle, who give a 
tolerably complete account of the teachings of Heraclitus.  
 <!--
54 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p54"></a><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Doctrine of Universal Change</b>. Heraclitus places himself in 
direct opposition to the Eleatic teaching and to the data of common, 
unreflecting consciousness. The mass of men -- and here he includes not 
merely Pythagoras and Xenophanes but also Homer and Hesiod, associating 
them with the common herd -- see nothing but sense-forms; they fail to 
comprehend the all-discerning <i>reason</i>.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> We should follow reason 
alone. "Much learning does not teach the mind."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Now, the first lesson which reason teaches us is that <i>there is 
nothing permanent in the world around us</i>. The senses, when they 
attribute to things a permanence which things do not possess, are 
deceived and thus give rise to the greatest of all errors, the belief 
in immobility. The truth is that all things change, <b>panta 
ch&ocirc;rei</b>. Everything is involved in the stream of change: from 
life comes death, from death comes life; old age succeeds youth; sleep 
changes into wakefulness and wakefulness into sleep. In a word, nothing 
is, all is Becoming.<p>

Both Plato<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> and Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> set down the doctrine of the 
universality of change as being the most characteristic of the 
teachings of Heraclitus. Plato, moreover, expressly mentions the 
Heraclitean comparison of the stream in which wave succeeds wave. But 
it is remarkable that the expression, "All things are flowing," which 
so conveniently sums up the doctrine of universal change, cannot be 
proved to be a quotation from the work of Heraclitus.<p>

<b>Doctrine of Fire</b>. Another source of error is this: that the 
poets and sages knew no more than the common herd does about the 
divine, all-controlling fire. By fire, however, Heraclitus  
 <!--
HERACLITUS 55 
 --><A NAME="p55"></a>
 meant invisible warm matter rather than the fire which is the result 
of combustion. It is endowed with life, or at least with the power of 
Becoming  --  "All things are exchanged for fire and fire for all 
things, just as wares are exchanged for gold and gold for wares."<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> It 
is, therefore, what Aristotle would call the material as well as the 
efficient cause of all things, -- and here Heraclitus shows himself the 
lineal descendant of the Earlier Ionians. Moreover, since all things 
proceed from fire according to fixed law, fire is styled Zeus, Deity, 
Logos, Justice.<p>

This account would, however, be incomplete without some mention of the 
force which is postulated by Heraclitus as coeternal with fire. "Strife 
is the father of all, and king of all, and some he made gods, and some, 
men."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Opposed to strife, which gave rise to things by separation, is 
harmony, which guides them back to the fire whence they came. These 
expressions, however, while they speak the language of dualism, are not 
to be understood as more than mere figures of speech, for fire, and 
fire alone, is the cause of all change.<p>

<b>Origin of the World</b>. The world was produced by the 
transformations of the primitive fire. There is a cycle of changes by 
which fire through a process of condensation, or rather of 
<i>quenching</i> (<b>sbennusthai</b>), becomes water and earth. This is 
the downward way. And there is a cycle of changes by which through a 
process of rarefaction, or <i>kindling</i> (<b>haptesthai</b>), earth 
goes back to water and water to fire. This is the upward way. Now, the 
one is precisely the inverse of the other: <b>hodos an&ocirc; kat&ocirc; 
mia</b>.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Thus did the world originate and thus does it constantly tend to return 
whence it came. Concord is ever undoing the work of strife, and one day 
strife will be overcome; but then the Deity, as it were in sport,<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> will 
construct a new world in which strife and concord will once more be at 
play. 
 <!--
56 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p56"></a><p>

<b>Doctrine of Opposites</b>. From this continual change comes the 
<i>doctrine of opposites</i>. There is a constant swaying (like the 
bending and relaxing of a bow<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup>), in which all things pass 
successively through their opposites: heat becomes cold, dryness 
becomes moisture, etc. To produce the new, like must be coupled with 
unlike; high and low, the accordant with the discordant, are joined, 
that out of one may come all, and out of all, one. On account of this 
doctrine Heraclitus is censured by Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> and his commentators 
for denying the principle of contradiction. Hegelians, on the other 
hand, credit Heraclitus with being the first to recognize the unity of 
opposites, the identity of Being and not-Being.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> The truth is that 
Heraclitus deserves neither the blame of the Aristotelians nor the 
praise of the Hegelians. He does not affirm opposite predicates of the 
same subject at the same time and <i>sub eodem respectu</i>. Moreover, 
his is a physical, not a logical, theory, and to maintain the unity of 
opposites in the concrete is not the same as to hold the identity of 
Being and not-Being in the abstract.<p>

<b>Anthropological Doctrines</b>. Man, body and soul, originated from 
fire. The body is of itself rigid and lifeless, an object of aversion 
when the soul has departed from it. The soul, on the other hand, is 
divine fire preserved in its purest form. "The driest soul is wisest 
and best."<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> If the soul fire is quenched by moisture, reason is lost. 
Like everything else in nature, the soul is constantly changing. It is 
fed by fire, or warm matter, which enters as breath or is received 
through the senses. Not. withstanding this view, Heraclitus in several 
of the fragments speaks of future reward and of the fate of the soul in 
Hades.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Heraclitus <i>distrusted sense-knowledge</i>: "Eyes and ears," he said, 
"are bad witnesses to men, if they have souls that   
 <!--
HERACLITUS 57
 --><A NAME="p57"></a>
 understand not their language." <sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> Rational knowledge is alone 
trustworthy. Heraclitus, however, did not, nor did any of the
 pre-Socratic philosophers, attempt to determine the conditions of 
rational knowledge. That task was first undertaken by Socrates.<p>

<b>Ethical Doctrines</b>. Heraclitus did not undertake a systematic 
treatment of ethical questions. Nevertheless, he prepared the way for 
Stoicism by teaching that Immutable Reason is the law of the moral as 
well as of the physical world. "Men should defend law as they would a 
fortress."<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> We must subject ourselves to universal order if we wish 
to be truly happy: "the character of a man is his guardian 
divinity."<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> This is the doctrine of <i>contentment</i>, or 
<i>equanimity</i> (<b>euarest&ecirc;sis</b>), in which, according to 
the Heracliteans, Heraclitus placed the supreme happiness of man.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Even in ancient times Heraclitus was 
regarded as one of the greatest <i>physicists</i>. He was deservedly 
styled <b>ho phusikos</b> for, while others among the philosophers of 
nature excelled him in particular points of doctrine, he had the 
peculiar merit of having established a universal point of view for the 
study of nature as a whole. He was the first to call attention to the 
transitoriness of the individual and the permanence of the law which 
governs individual changes, thus formulating the problem to which Plato 
and Aristotle afterwards addressed themselves as to the paramount 
question of metaphysics. The na&iuml;ve conception of the universe as 
evolved, according to the Earlier Ionians, from one substance, by a 
process which may be witnessed in a water tank, now gives place to the 
notion of a world ruled in its origin and in all its processes by an 
all-pervading Logos. Moreover, though Heraclitus formulated no system 
of epistemology, his distrust of the senses and his advocacy of 
rational knowledge show that philosophy had begun to emerge from the 
state of primitive innocence. It was this germ of 
 <!--
58 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p58"></a>
 criticism which was developed into full-grown Scepticism by Cratylus, 
while along another line of development it led to the critical 
philosophy of the Sophists and to the Socratic doctrine of the concept.<p>

Heraclitus and the Eleatics were, so to speak, at opposite poles of 
thought. In the doctrines of Empedocles and the Atomists we can 
perceive the direct influence of the Eleatic school.<p>

EMPEDOCLES<p>

<b>Life</b>. Empedocles, who is the most typical representative of the 
Later Ionian school, holds a middle course between the monism of 
Parmenides and the extreme panmetabolism of Heraclitus. He was born at 
Agrigentum, in Sicily, about the year 490 B.C. According to Aristotle, 
he lived sixty years. The tradition which represents Empedocles as 
traveling through Sicily and southern Italy and claiming divine honors 
wherever he went is only too abundantly proved by fragments of his 
sacred poems. The story, however, that he committed suicide by leaping 
into the crater of Etna is a malicious invention; it is always 
mentioned with a hostile purpose, and usually in order to counteract 
some tale told by his adherents and admirers.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Empedocles, who was a poet as well as a philosopher, 
composed two poetico-philosophical treatises, the one metaphysical 
(<b>peri phuse&ocirc;s</b>), and the other theological 
(<b>katharmoi</b>). Of the five thousand verses which these poems 
contained, only about four hundred and fifty have come down to us. On 
account of the language and imagery which Empedocles employs, he is 
styled by Aristotle the first rhetorician.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Metaphysics</b>. Empedocles, like Parmenides, begins with a denial 
of Becoming. Becoming, in the strict sense of qualitative change of an 
original substance, is unthinkable. Yet, with Heraclitus, he holds that 
particular things arise, change, decay, and perish. He reconciles the 
two positions by teaching that generation is but the commingling, while 
decay is the separation of primitive substances which themselves remain 
unchanged.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--
EMPEDOCLES 59  
 --><A NAME="p59"></a><p>

The primitive substances are four: <i>fire, air, earth,</i> and 
<i>water</i>; these afterwards came to be known as the Four Elements. 
Empedocles calls them <i>roots</i> (<b>tessara t&ocirc;n pant&ocirc;n 
hriz&ocirc;mata</b>). The word elements (<b>stoicheia</b>) was first 
used by Plato. The mythological names which Empedocles applied to these 
radical principles of Being have no particular philosophical value; 
they may be regarded as the accidents of poetical composition. The 
elements are underived, imperishable, homogeneous. Definite substances 
are produced when the elements are combined in certain proportions. 
Now, the moving cause, the force, which produces these combinations is 
not inherent in the elements themselves; it is distinct from them. Here 
we have the first word of mechanism in Greek philosophy. It is true, 
Empedocles speaks of this force as <i>love</i> and <i>hatred</i>,<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> 
but the phraseology merely proves that the idea of force is not yet 
clear to the Greek mind: Empedocles does not define the difference 
between force and matter on the one hand, and between force and person 
on the other. Moreover, to deny that Empedocles was a dualist, to 
explain that by love and hatred he meant merely a poetical description 
of the conditions of mixture and separation, and not the true causes of 
these processes, would imply that Aristotle and all our other 
authorities misunderstood the whole doctrine of Empedocles.<p>

<b>Cosmological Doctrines</b>. The four elements were originally 
combined in a <i>sphere</i> (<b>eudaimonestatos theos</b>) where love 
reigned supreme.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> Gradually hatred began to exert its centrifugal 
influence; love, however, united the elements once more to form those 
things which were made. And so the world is given over to love and 
hatred, and to the endless pulsation of periodic changes.<p>

<b>Biological Doctrines</b>. Empedocles seems to have devoted special 
attention to the study of living organisms. Plants first sprang from 
the earth before it was illumined by the sun; and  
 <!--
60 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p60"></a>
 then came animals, which were evolved out of all sorts of monstrous 
combinations of organisms by a kind of survival of the fit; for those 
only survived which were capable of subsisting.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> In this theory 
Empedocles expressly includes man.<p>

The <i>cause of growth</i> in animals and plants is fire striving 
upwards impelled by the desire to reach its like, the fire which is in 
the sky. Blood is the seat of the soul, because in blood the elements 
are best united.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> It is by reason of the movement of the blood that 
inspiration and respiration take place through the pores which are 
closely packed together all over the body.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Psychological Doctrines</b>. Sense-knowledge is explained by the 
doctrine of emanations and pores.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> Like is known by like, that is, 
things are known to us by means of like elements in us, "earth by 
earth, water by water," etc.<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> In the case of sight, there is an 
emanation from the eye itself, which goes out to meet the emanation 
from the object.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> Thought and intelligence are ascribed to all things, 
no distinction being made between corporeal and incorporeal. Thought, 
therefore, like all other vital activities, depends on the mixture of 
the four elements.<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> Yet Empedocles seems to contrast the 
untrustworthiness of sense-knowledge with knowledge acquired by 
reflection, or rather with knowledge acquired by all the powers of the 
mind.<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> He did not conceive the soul as composed of elements; he did not 
consider it as an entity apart from the body; he merely explained its 
activities by the constitution of the body. In his sacred poem, 
however, he adopted the doctrine of transmigration, borrowing it from 
Pythagorean and Orphic tradition, without making it part of his 
scientific theories. "Once ere now I was a youth, and a maiden, a 
shrub, a bird, and a fish that swims in silence in the sea."<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
ANAXAGORAS 61  
 --><A NAME="p61"></a><p>

<b>Concerning the Gods</b>. Empedocles sometimes speaks as if he held 
the common polytheistic belief. Sometimes, on the contrary, as in 
verses 345 to 350, he describes the Deity almost in the words of 
Xenophanes: "He is sacred and unutterable mind, flashing through the 
whole world with rapid thoughts." Still, Empedocles apparently found no 
means of introducing this concept of the Deity into his account of the 
origin of the universe.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. While Empedocles holds a recognized place 
among the Greek poets, and while Plato and Aristotle appear to rank him 
highly as a philosopher, yet scholars are not agreed as to his precise 
place in the history of pre-Socratic speculation. Ritter classes him 
with the Eleatics, others count him among the disciples of Pythagoras, 
while others again place him among the Ionians on account of the 
similarity of his doctrines to those of Heraclitus and the early 
Physicists. The truth, as Zeller says, seems to be that there is in the 
philosophy of Empedocles an admixture of all these influences, --  
Eleatic (denial of Becoming, untrustworthiness of the senses), 
Pythagorean (doctrine of transmigration), and Ionic (the four elements 
and love and hatred, -- these being an adaptation of Heraclitean 
ideas). It would be a mistake, however, to underestimate the 
originality of Empedocles as a philosopher. It was he who introduced 
the notion of element, fixed the number of elements, and prepared the 
way for the atomistic mechanism of Leucippus. The defects, however, of 
his metaphysical system are many, chief among them being, as 
Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> remarked, the omission of the idea of an intelligent Ruler 
under whose action natural processes would be regular instead of 
fortuitous.<p>

ANAXAGORAS<p>

<b>Life</b>. Anaxagoras was born at Clazomenae about 500 B.C. 
Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> says that he was "prior to Empedocles in point of age, but 
subsequent to him in respect to doctrine." From his native city he went 
to Athens, where  
 <!--
62 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p62"></a>
 he was for many years the friend of Pericles, and where he counted 
among his disciples the dramatist Euripides. When, shortly before the 
outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, Pericles was attacked, Anaxagoras 
was tried on the charge of impiety, but escaped from prison and, 
returning to his native Ionia, settled in Lampsacus, where he died 
about the year 430 B.C.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Diogenes Laertius says that Anaxagoras wrote a work 
which, like most of the ancient philosophical treatises, was entitled 
<b>peri physe&ocirc;s</b>. Of this work Plato speaks in the 
<i>Apology</i>; in the sixth century of our era Simplicius could still 
procure a copy, and it is to him that we owe such fragments as have 
come down to us. These fragments were edited by Schaubach in 1827, and 
by Schorn in 1829. They are printed by Mullach.<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Starting Point</b>. Like Empedocles, Anaxagoras starts with the 
denial of Becoming, and, like Empedocles also, he is chiefly concerned 
to explain, in accordance with this denial, the plurality and change 
which exist. He differs, however, from Empedocles, both in his doctrine 
of primitive substances and in his doctrine of the cosmic force which 
formed the universe.<p>

<b>Doctrine of Primitive Substances</b>. Anaxagoras maintained that all 
things were formed out of an agglomerate of substances in which bodies 
of determinate quality -- gold, flesh, bones, etc. -- were commingled 
in infinitely small particles to form the germs of all things.<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup> This 
agglomerate was called by Aristotle <b>ta homoiomer&ecirc;</b>  it was 
called by Anaxagoras <i>seeds</i> (<b>st&ecirc;rmata</b>) and things 
(<b>chr&ecirc;mata</b>). So complete was the mixture, and so small were 
the particles of individual substances composing it, that at the 
beginning no substance could be perceived in its individual nature and 
qualities, and accordingly the mixture as a whole might be said to be 
qualitatively indeterminate, though definite qualities were really 
present in it. Yet, minute as were the primitive particles, they were 
divisible. Thus the agglomerate on the one hand reminds us of the 
<b>apeiron</b> of Anaximander, and 
 <!--
ANAXAGORAS 63 
 --><A NAME="p63"></a>
 on the other hand bears a certain analogy to the atomistic concept of 
matter.<p>

<b>Mind</b> (<b>Nous</b>) is the moving power which formed the world 
from the primitive mass of "seeds." Anaxagoras is the first to 
introduce into philosophy the idea of the supersensible, for which 
reason Aristotle describes him<sup><small><a name="n35"><a href="#n_35">{35}</a></a></small></sup> as standing out "like a sober man 
from the crowd of random talkers who preceded him." Mind is 
distinguished from other things because (1) it is <i>simple</i> -- 
everything else is mingled of all things; mind alone is unmixed. It is 
"the thinnest of all things and the purest." (2) It is
 <i>self-ruled</i> (<b>autokrat&ecirc;s</b>). (3) <i>It has all 
knowledge</i> about everything. (4) It has supreme <i>power over all 
things</i>.<sup><small><a name="n36"><a href="#n_36">{36}</a></a></small></sup><p>

However, as Plato and Aristotle point out, Anaxagoras did not work out 
his theory of mind in the details of the cosmic processes. He did not 
formulate the idea of design, nor did he apply the principle of design 
to particular cases. Mind was for him merely a world-forming force. 
There is, moreover, a certain vagueness attaching to the idea of 
<b>Nous</b>. Without entering into the details of the question of 
interpretation,<sup><small><a name="n37"><a href="#n_37">{37}</a></a></small></sup> we may conclude that although Anaxagoras certainly 
meant by the <b>Nous</b> something incorporeal, he could not avoid 
speaking of it in terms which, taken literally, imply corporeal nature; 
for it is the fate of new ideas to suffer from imperfect expression 
until philosophical terminology has adjusted itself to the new 
conditions which they create.<p>

<b>Cosmology</b>. Mind, therefore, first imparted to matter a circular 
motion<sup><small><a name="n38"><a href="#n_38">{38}</a></a></small></sup> separating Air (from which came water, earth, and stone, and 
whatever is cold, dark, and dense) and Ether (from which came whatever 
is warm, light, and rare). Throughout this account of the processes of 
things Anaxagoras considers  
 <!--
64 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p64"></a>
 the material cause only, thereby deserving Aristotle's reproach, that 
he used the <b>Nous</b> merely as a <i>Deus ex machina</i>.<p>

<b>Psychology</b>. Like is not known by like, but rather by unlike,<sup><small><a name="n39"><a href="#n_39">{39}</a></a></small></sup> 
and in this Anaxagoras is directly opposed to Empedocles. The senses 
are "weak but not deceitful"; the faculty of true knowledge is 
<b>Nous</b>, the principle of understanding, which is also<sup><small><a name="n40"><a href="#n_40">{40}</a></a></small></sup> an 
intrinsic psychic principle -- the soul. Plutarch's statement<sup><small><a name="n41"><a href="#n_41">{41}</a></a></small></sup> that 
Anaxagoras represented the soul as perishing after its separation from 
the body is, to say the least, unreliable.<p>

From the foregoing it is evident that Anaxagoras was not a Sceptic. The 
reason which he alleges for the untrustworthiness of the senses is that 
they see only part of what is in the object.<sup><small><a name="n42"><a href="#n_42">{42}</a></a></small></sup> The intellect, which is 
unmixed, is capable of seeing the everything which is in everything.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The special importance of the philosophy of 
Anaxagoras is due to his doctrine of immaterial mind. This doctrine 
implies the most pronounced dualism; it contains in germ the 
teleological concept which was evolved by Socrates and perfected by 
Plato and Aristotle. It was only natural that these philosophers, who 
approached metaphysical problems with minds already accustomed to the 
idea of the immaterial, should blame Anaxagoras for not having made 
better use of that idea. But we must not underrate the service which 
Anaxagoras rendered to Greek philosophy by his doctrine of immaterial 
intellect.<p>

<b>Diogenes</b> of Apollonia and <b>Archelaus</b> of Athens, who are 
sometimes included among the Later Ionian philosophers, exhibit a 
tendency towards a return to the hylozoism of the first 
philosophers.<p>
