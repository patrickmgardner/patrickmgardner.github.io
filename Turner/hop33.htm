THE SCHOOL OF CHARTRES</h3><p>

During the twelfth century Chartres became the scene of a Platonic 
reaction against the anti-realism represented by Roscelin and Abelard. 
The founders of the school of Chartres were the brothers <b>Bernard</b> 
and <b>Theodoric</b> of Chartres, with whom were associated <b>William 
of Conches</b> and <b>Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e.</b><sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup><p>

BERNARD OF CHARTRES<p>

<b>Life</b>. Bernard of Chartres taught at Chartres during the early 
part of the twelfth century. Among his disciples were William of 
Conches and Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e. In 1119 he was made 
chancellor of the church of Chartres. He died about the year 1125.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. According to John of Salisbury, Bernard composed a 
prose treatise, <i>De Exositione Porphyrii</i>, a metrical treatise on 
the same subject, a moral poem on education, and probably a fourth work 
in which he sought to reconcile Plato with Aristotle. Fragments of 
these treatises are to be

 found in the <i>Metalogicus</i>, IV, 35, and the <i>Polycraticus</i>, 
VII, 3 (<i>apud</i> Migne, <i>Patr. Lat.</i>, Vol. CXLIX, coll. 938 and 666). 
Haur&eacute;au <i>op. cit.</i>, I, 408) falls into the common error of 
confounding Bernard of Chartres with Bernard of Tours, and assigns to 
the former works which are to be ascribed to the latter.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Bernard, in common with others of his school, devoted more attention to 
the study of the <i>Timaeus</i> and of the works of the Neo-Platonists 
than to the study of Aristotle's dialectical treatises and of the 
commentaries of Boethius. Consequently, he not only discussed the 
problem of universals (distinguishing between the abstract, the 
process, and the concrete, -- <i>albedao, albet</i>, and 
<i>album</i>),<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> but also occupied himself with problems of 
metaphysics and cosmology.<p>

<b>Metaphysics</b>. There are three categories of reality, -- God, 
matter, and idea. God is supreme reality. Matter was brought out of 
nothingness by God's creative act, and is the element which, in union 
with Ideas, constitutes the world of sensible things. Ideas are the 
prototypes by means of which the world was from all eternity present to 
the Divine Mind; they constitute the world of Providence ("in qua omnia 
semel et simul fecit Deus"), and are eternal but not coeternal with 
God. According to John of Salisbury, Bernard also taught that there 
exist native forms -- copies of the Ideas created with matter  -- which 
are alone united with matter. It is difficult, however, to determine 
what was Bernard's doctrine on this point. It is sufficient to note 
that he reproduced in his metaphysical doctrines many of the 
characteristic traits of Platonism and Neo-Platonism, -- the intellect 
as the <i>habitat</i> of Ideas, the world-soul, eternal matter, matter 
the source of imperfection, etc.<p>

<b>Cosmology</b>. Matter, although caused by God, existed from all 
eternity. In the beginning, before its union with the Ideas, 
 <!--
294 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p294"></a>
 it was in a chaotic condition. It was by means of the native forms, 
which penetrate matter, that distinction, order, regularity, and number 
were introduced into the universe.<p>

THEODORIC OF CHARTRES<p>

<b>Life</b>. Theodoric of Chartres was <i>magister scholae</i> at 
Chartres about the year 1121. It is said that he taught at Paris in the 
year 1140: it was probably at Paris that he taught rhetoric to John of 
Salisbury. In we find Theodoric teaching once more at Chartres. Like 
Bernard, he devoted more attention to the study of the Platonists than 
to that of the Aristotelians. The most probable date of his death is 
1150.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Besides the work <i>De Sex Dierum Operibus</i>, of 
which a mutilated manuscript copy has come down to us, Theodoric wrote 
a commentary on the <i>De Inventione Rhetorica ad Herennium</i>. This 
commentary, which was first published in 1884, is an indication of the 
humanistic tendency of the school of Chartres.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Theodoric was an enthusiastic student of the classics, "artium 
studiosissimus investigator," as John of Salisbury says. We know that 
he possessed a Latin translation of the <i>Planisphere</i> of Ptolemy, 
which he obtained from the Arabian scholars of Toulouse. It was, 
however, to the Platonic metaphysics and cosmology that he devoted his 
attention as a philosopher, taking his stand with the other 
"Chartrains" on the side of the Platonic realists.<p>

<b>Metaphysics</b>. Going farther in his advocacy of Neo-Platonic 
principles than Bernard had gone, identifying unity with divinity and 
divinity with reality, Theodoric maintained the principles "Divinitas 
singulis rebus forma essendi est" and "Omne quod est ideo est quia unum 
est."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Now, if divinity is synonymous with reality and is the 
intrinsic essential principle of all things, 
 <!--
WILLIAM OF CONCHES 295 
 --><A NAME="p295"></a>
 Theodoric's system is fully developed pantheism. Quite recently, 
however, Baeumker has shown<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> that here, as in the case of Eckart and 
other mediaeval mystics, we must distinguish between the <i>individual 
essence</i>, which is proper to each created being, and the <i>formal 
essence</i>, the divine in each creature, which is God. Technically, 
therefore, Theodoric must be considered innocent of the charge of 
teaching explicit pantheism.<p>

<b>Cosmology</b>. In the work <i>De Sex Dierum</i> Operibus Theodoric 
set himself the task of showing that the Neo-Platonic account of the 
origin of the universe agrees with the Mosaic account of the creation. 
Moses, he declared, was <i>prudeniissimus philosophorum</i>.<p>

WILLIAM OF CONCHES<p>

<b>Life</b>. William of Conches, a pupil of Bernard of Chartres, after 
having taught a system of Platonic realism in the schools at Paris 
(about 1122), was warned by William of St. Thierry that his 
theological doctrines, and in particular his apparent identification of 
the Holy Ghost with the world-soul, would lead to heresy. Thereupon he 
abandoned the study of theology and, seeking the protection of Geoffrey 
the Fair, count of Anjou, devoted himself to the study of nature. 
William is the first of the mediaeval philosophers to show acquaintance 
with the physical science of the Arabians, which, through the 
translations made by Constantine the African, began to be known in 
Europe about the middle of the twelfth century.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. No question of mediaeval bibliography is more 
hopelessly intricate than that of the authorship of the works 
attributed to William of Conches. The most recent investigations and 
discussions<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> seem to warrant the following list: glosses on the 
<i>Timaeus</i>, a commentary on <i>Boethius' De Consolatione 
Philosophiae</i>, a treatise <i>De Philosophia</i>, of which the 
<i>Dragmaticon</i> (probably <i>Dramaticon</i>) is a corrected edition 
cast in dialogue form, and the <i>Magna de Naturis Philosophia</i>. It 
is almost certain, however, that the last mentioned work, of which no 
copy is extant, belongs to a later date and was written by William of 
Auvergne. The <i>Dragmaticon</i> in its earliest form is published by 
Migne (<i>Patr. Lat.</i>, Vol. XC, coll. 2227 ff.), under the title 
<i>Elementorum Philosophia. Libri Quatuor</i>.

DOCTRINES<p>

After his retirement from the field of theological and metaphysical 
controversy, in which he had sustained the cause of the Platonists, who 
were edging closer and closer to the border line of pantheism, William, 
inspired by the labors of the Arabian physicists, took up the study of 
psychology and cosmology.<p>

<b>Psychology</b>. In his study of the processes of knowledge William 
distinguishes between sensation, imagination, and reason. Rejecting the 
theory of forms mediating between object and subject, he devotes his 
attention to what we should call the <i>physiological aspect</i> of the 
problems of psychology. There are, he says, three departments in the 
brain ("in capite tres sunt cellae una in prora, altera in puppe, 
tertia in medio "). In the front part of the brain is the region of 
vision (<i>fantastica</i>), in the middle is the region of thought 
(<i>logistica</i>), and in the rear portion is the region of memory 
(<i>memorialis</i>). In his commentary on the <i>Timaeus</i>, however, 
he speaks as a Platonist. Above all the faculties of the soul, he says, 
is <b>nous</b> (intelligence), by which alone we are enabled to 
perceive the incorporeal.<p>

<b>Cosmology</b>. In his account of the universe and the elements which 
compose it, our philosopher is an <i>atomist</i>: "Sunt, igitur, in 
unoquoque corpore minima quae, simul juncta, unum magnum constituunt"; 
and when the interlocutor objects that this is the opinion of Epicurus, 
William answers that there is no sect that has not some admixture of 
truth.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

GILBERT DE LA PORR&Eacute;E<p>

<b>Life</b>. Gilbert was born at Poitiers, in 1076. He was successively 
the pupil of Bernard of Chartres and of Anselm of Laon. After teaching 
for about twenty years at Chartres, where he held the office of 
chancellor, he went to Paris and there lectured on dialectic and 
theology. Later on he returned to Poitiers, of which city he was made 
bishop in 1142. On  
 <!--
GILBERT DE LA PORR&Eacute;E 297 
 --><A NAME="p297"></a>
 account of his theological doctrines concerning the Trinity and the 
Incarnation he was suspected of heresy by St. Bernard and his 
followers. The council of Paris, which, in 1147, was summoned to 
consider his doctrines, and which was presided over by Eugenius III, 
was unable to arrive at a decision. It reassembled at Rheims in the 
following year. According to the account given by John of Salisbury, 
who was present, and by Otto of Freising, also a contemporary, it was 
not the doctrine of Gilbert but the influence of St. Bernard that was 
on trial. The outcome seems to have been that the council decided 
nothing. Gilbert returned to his see and was not further molested. He 
died in 1154.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Gilbert composed a work entitled <i>De Sex 
Principiis</i> , a treatise on the last six of the Aristotelian 
categories. This book was made the basis of commentaries by Albert the 
Great; it was frequently referred to by St. Thomas, and it was held in 
great esteem as a text-book on logic until the close of the Middle 
Ages. Gilbert wrote also a commentary on the treatise <i>De 
Trinitate</i>, which was supposed to have been written by Boethius. 
Mention is also made of a work <i>De Duabus Naturis et Una Persona 
Christi</i>; this, however, is apparently the fourth book of the 
pseudo-Boethian compilation. The commentary on the pseudo-Boethian 
treatise is published by Migne, <i>Patr. Lat.</i>, Vol. LXIV, and the 
treatise <i>De Sex Principiis</i>, <i>ibid.</i>, Vol. CLXXXVIII, coll. 1257 
ff.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Notwithstanding the renown which Gilbert attained as an exponent of 
Aristotelian dialectic, his philosophy, as far as we know it, breathes 
the spirit of Plato and betrays the Platonizing influence of the school 
of Chartres.<p>

<b>Doctrine of Universals</b>. In his doctrine of universals Gilbert, 
according to John of Salisbury, attributed universality to the <i>formae 
nativae</i> existing in things:<p>

<blockquote>
Est autem farina nativa originalis exemplum et quae non in mente Dei 
consistit, sed rebus creatis inhaeret. Haec Graeco eloquio dicitur 
eidos.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

<i>Nativa</i> in the context evidently means new, born, created. But 
what are these created forms inherent in created things? It is  
 <!--
298 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p298"></a>
 usual to represent them as full-fledged universals, possessing their 
universality antecedently to the act of the human mind; and if this 
interpretation be correct, Gilbert should be reckoned among the
 ultra-realists. It is evident, however, from the commentaries on the 
<i>Four Books on The Trinity</i>, that Gilbert attached quite a 
different meaning to the <i>formae nativae</i>. He says, for example:<p>

<blockquote>
Non solum enim rationalium sed etiam non rationalium substantiarum 
individuarum universalia quaedam sunt, quae ab ipsis individuis humana 
ratio quodammodo abstrahit ut earum naturam perspicere . . . possit.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

It is, therefore, the mind that abstracts the universal and makes it to 
be universal, -- a formula which at once separates Gilbert from the 
ranks of the ultra-realists. Elsewhere<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> he bases the unity of the 
universal on the similarity of essences, -- another formula which is 
opposed to ultra-realism. There must, however, be some reason why so 
many historians have counted Gilbert among the ultra-realists, and the 
explanation may possibly be found in the fact that his general 
metaphysical doctrines are Platonic.<p>

<b>Metaphysical Doctrines</b>. Thus, when Gilbert distinguishes between 
the essential reality, which he calls the <i>subsistence</i> ("id quo 
est"), and the individual determination, which he calls the 
<i>substance</i> ("id quod est"), an Aristotelian might admit the 
distinction. Gilbert, however, goes so far as to maintain that unity, 
for example, is a subsistence distinct from that which is one.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> The 
Platonic tendency is also apparent in the doctrine of native forms, 
although Gilbert is careful to avoid the Neo-Platonic doctrine that the 
forms are in some sense to be identified with the mind of God ("non in 
mente Dei consistit").<p>

<b>Historical Position of the School of Chartres</b>. The group of 
philosophers included under the title of this chapter represents an 
eclectic tendency, that is, an attempt at uniting Platonism 
 <!--
JOHN OF SALISBURY 299 
 --><A NAME="p299"></a>
 with Aristotelianism. To this eclectic tendency is joined a broader 
spirit of humanism and, at least in the case of William of Conches, a 
spirit of scientific inquiry. The spirit of eclecticism and also the 
humanistic and scientific spirit are still more marked in the next 
group of philosophers.<p>
