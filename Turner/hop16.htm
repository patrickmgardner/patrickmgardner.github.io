THE ECLECTICS<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

The Eclecticism of this third period in the history of Greek philosophy 
is merely another aspect of the Scepticism which resulted from the 
exhaustion of speculative thought. The conflict of parties and schools 
led to the Sceptic despair of attaining scientific knowledge; the same 
cause led to the Eclectic attempt at finding in a looser concept of 
system a common speculative basis on which to erect a philosophy of 
conduct. Eclecticism relinquished the task of constructing a 
speculative system in the stricter sense of the word, and adopted what 
may be called a working hypothesis, falling back on common 
consciousness or uncriticised immediate knowledge as the final test of 
philosophic truth. The Eclectic tendency penetrated all the schools, 
everywhere dissolving the spirit of system which, under scholarchs of 
inferior ability, had already begun to lose its primitive

 power of cohesion. Accordingly, among the Stoics and Epicureans as 
well as among the followers of Plato and Aristotle, we find all through 
the century and a half before Christ as well as during the first three 
centuries of the Christian era evidences of the Eclectic spirit 
preparing the way for the more comprehensive syncretic efforts of the 
school of Alexandria.<p>

Among the <i>Stoics</i> the principal Eclectics were <b>Boethus</b>, 
who borrowed from Peripatetic sources, and <b>Panaetius</b> and 
<b>Posidonius</b>. The latter two belonged to the second century before 
Christ and strove, under the influence of Platonic and Aristotelian 
ideas, to moderate the rigor of Stoic morality. Later, in the second 
century after Christ, <b>Demetrius</b> and <b>Demonax</b> exhibited a 
tendency to return to the ultra-Stoic rigor of Cynicism.<p>

Among the <i>Epicureans</i> <b>Asclepiades</b> of Bithynia modified the 
teaching of his school by maintaining the indefinite divisibility of 
atoms.<p>

The <i>Platonic Academy</i> shows the influence of the Eclectic spirit 
in the teachings of <b>Philo</b> of Larissa and of <b>Antiochus</b> of 
Ascalon,<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> as well as of Eudorus of Alexandria, who was a contemporary 
of Augustus.<p>

Mention has already been made<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> of Andronicus of Rhodes, Alexander of 
Aphrodisias, and Galen, who were Eclectics of the <i>Peripatetic</i> 
school.<p>
