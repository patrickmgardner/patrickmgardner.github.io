THOMISTS AND ANTI-THOMISTS</h3><p>

<b>Sources</b>. Besides the works of the philosophers to be mentioned 
under this head, we possess as valuable sources of information 
Denifle's <i>Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis</i> and articles by 
Denifle, Ehrle, and others in the <i>Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Katholische 
Theologie</i> and in the <i>Archiv f&uuml;r Litteratur und 
Kirchengeschichte des Mittelalters</i>.<p>

While St. Thomas was teaching at the convent of St. James, several of 
his doctrines -- especially that of the unity of the substantial form 
in man -- aroused violent opposition among his confr&egrave;res of the 
order of St. Dominic. Of these Dominican opponents of St. Thomas the 
most prominent were <b>Roland of Cremona, Richard Fitzacre</b>, and 
<b>Robert Kilwardby</b>. It was owing to the influence of Kilwardby, 
who was archbishop of Canterbury, that the masters of the university of 
Oxford carried their opposition to Thomism so far as to censure as 
dangerous the denial of the <i>rationes seminales</i> and the 
affirmation of the unity of the substantial form in man. This was in 
1277. In the following year, however, all opposition on the part of the 
Dominicans ceased, and in a general chapter of the order, held at 
Milan in that year, those who had opposed the teaching of St. Thomas in 
England were censured.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The Franciscans, jealous for the reputation of the great teachers of 
their order, Alexander of Hales and St. Bonaventure, made common cause 
with those who objected to the doctrine of unity of substantial forms 
and to the denial of the <i>rationes seminales</i> -- doctrines which, 
as we have seen, were part of the Franciscan tradition.<p>

Foremost among St. Thomas' Franciscan adversaries were <b>William de la 
Mare</b>, author of the <i>Correptorium Fratris Thomae</i>, <b>Richard 
of Middletown</b>, who was appointed to the Franciscan chair  
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 382 
 --><A NAME="p382"></a>
 at Paris in 1281, <b>John Peckham</b>, who, after teaching at Paris 
and at Oxford, succeeded Kilwardby in the see of Canterbury, and 
<b>Peter John Olivi</b> (1248-1298),<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> who later on unsettled the idea 
of discipline in his own order by his defense of literal poverty -- a 
doctrine which brought about his condemnation in 1283.<p>

Opposed to the doctrines introduced by St. Thomas were also the secular 
teachers, the chief of whom were <b>William of St. Amour, Gerard of 
Abbeville</b>, and <b>Henry of Ghent</b>. When, on March 7, 1277, 
Stephen Tempier, at the request of John XXI, assembled the masters of 
theology of the University of Paris to condemn the errors then 
prevalent in the schools, the secular masters united with the 
Franciscans and succeeded in placing on the list of condemned 
propositions several (for example, Nos. 81, 96, and 191) which were 
evidently meant to formulate the Thomistic doctrine of substantial 
forms and of individuation.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> Thus did the secular teachers of the 
university achieve a disgraceful triumph in the momentary discredit 
thrown on him who had been the great champion of the mendicants in the 
controversy concerning university privilege.<p>

But, while the opposition to Thomism was as short-lived as it was 
violent, the number and importance of the advocates and defenders of 
St. Thomas grew slowly but steadily as time went on. First among these 
were <b>Ulrich of Strasburg</b>, a disciple of Albert the Great, 
<b>Bernard of Hotun</b>, who was bishop of Dublin and died in 1298, 
<b>William Mackelfield</b>, who taught at Oxford, <b>Giles of Rome</b> 
(<i>AEgidius a Columna, or AEgidius Romanus</i>) of the order of 
Hermits of St. Augustine, surnamed <i>Doctor Fundatissimus</i>
 (1243-1316), <b>Peter of Auvergne</b>, who was probably a pupil of St. 
Thomas at Paris, and <b>Godfrey of Fontaines</b> (died 1304).<p>

<b>Petrus Hispanus</b> (1226-1277), who in 1276 became pope, taking the 
name of John XXI, seems to have avoided the Thomistic controversy and 
confined his attention to the study of logical problems. His <i>Summulae 
Logicales</i> became a text-book in the 
 <!--
THOMISTS AND ANTI-THOMISTS 383 
 --><A NAME="p383"></a>
 schools, and was known as the <i>Logica Modernorum</i>, in 
contradistinction to the <i>Logica Vetus</i> and the <i>Logica 
Nova</i>. He is said to he the author of the mnemonic lines <i>Barbara 
Celarent</i>, etc.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Vincent of Beauvais</b> (died 1264) helped to popularize the current 
philosophical doctrines of his time in his encyclopaedic treatise 
entitled <i>Speculum Magnum</i>, in which he adhered to the teaching of 
Albert and St. Thomas. The work was intended to cover the whole field 
of education, as it was then understood. Three portions, <i>Speculum 
Historiale, Speculum Naturale</i>, and <i>Speculum Doctrinale</i>, were 
completed by Vincent:<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> the fourth, <i>Speculum Morale</i>, which is 
merely an extract from the writings of St. Thomas, was added by another 
hand.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Herv&eacute; of Nedeilec</b> (<i>Hervaeus Natalis</i>), who died in 
1323, must be reckoned among the ablest of the first followers of St. 
Thomas. He is the author of many works on philosophy and theology, 
including, though this is by no means certain, the <i>Summa Totius 
Logicae</i> found among the opuscula of St. Thomas.<p>

<b>Dante</b> (1265-1321), whose <i>Divina Commedia</i> has been 
described as "Aquinas in verse," may also be counted among those who 
helped to give wide circulation to the philosophical doctrines of St. 
Thomas. The influence of St. Thomas and of the other great schoolmen 
was still preponderant in Paris when Dante studied at the university in 
that city, and his <i>De Monarchia</i> may be placed by the side of the 
treatise <i>De Regimine Principis</i> as a valuable contribution to the 
political science of the Middle Ages. Although the Divine Comedy was 
written at a time when Scholasticism had begun to decline, and is, 
therefore, as Ozanam so beautifully expresses it, the "swan song of 
Scholasticism," it

 embodies the best doctrines of the Golden Age of Scholastic 
philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The subsequent history of the Thomistic school involves a study of the 
philosophical systems of Henry of Ghent and of Duns Scotus, who are the 
most important of the earlier opponents of Thomism, and who alone of 
all the Anti-Thomists left behind them a school of Anti-Thomistic 
tradition.<p>

lines from the logical treatises of <b>William of Shirwood</b> (or 
Shyrwode) (died 1249). This writer as well as Petrus Hispanus drew 
largely from Byzantine sources, especially from Psellus, who appears to 
have been the first to use mnemonic lines to designate the valid moods 
in the three Aristotelian figures (<i>cf.</i> Prantl, <i>op. cit.</i>, 
II, 276).<p>
