GERMAN ILLUMINATION -- TRANSITION TO KANT<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

PHILOSOPHY OF LAW<p>

During the seventeenth century <b>Samuel von Pufendorf</b> (1632-1694), 
who aimed at mediating between Grotius and Hobbes, and <b>Christian 
Thomasius</b> (1655-1728), who is considered the first of the German 
<i>Illuminati</i>, appeared as representatives of a new philosophy of 
law. They investigated the foundations of natural right, and formulated 
theories in accordance with the changed political conditions of Europe.<p>

POPULARIZERS<p>

It was the aim of many of the philosophical writers of the seventeenth 
and eighteenth centuries to free philosophy from the technical 
difficulties which rendered it inaccessible to the generality of 
readers, and in this way to reach the people, as the French authors of 
the <i>Encyclopaedia</i> were doing. <b>Walther von Tschirnhausen</b> 
(1651-1708), <b>Johann Nicolas Tetens</b> (1736-1805), and <b>Moses 
Mendelssohn</b> (1729-1786) represent different phases of this movement 
in different departments of thought, -- physical science, mental 
science, and religious philosophy. To the same period belongs the
 so-called Pietistic movement which aimed at counteracting the 
rationalistic tendency by quickening religious feeling.<p>

During the storm and stress movement of the last decades of the 
eighteenth century, when rationalism was at its height, <b>Gotthold 
Ephraim Lessing</b>  
 <!--
PHILOSOPHY FROM DESCARTES TO KANT 525 
 --><A NAME="p525"></a>
 (1729-1781), the philosopher-poet, expounded a system of
 religio-philosophical thought which may be said to be a system of 
natural religion, based partly on the pantheism of Spinoza's 
<i>Ethica</i>, and partly on the theism of Leibniz' 
<i>Th&eacute;odic&eacute;e</i>. To the same period belongs <b>Johann 
Gottfried von Herder</b> (1744-1803), whose <i>Ideen zur Philosophie der 
Geschichte der Menschheit</i><sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> marks an epoch in the history of the 
philosophy of history. In this work Herder interprets history from the 
point of view of the organic unity of the human race.<p>

<b>Christian von Wolff</b> (1679-1754) is of special importance on 
account of the influence which he exercised on Kant's early training. 
He attempted to <i>reduce Leibniz' philosophy to a systematic form</i>, 
but in doing so he modified the essential tenets of his predecessor, 
restricting the doctrine of pre&euml;stablished harmony to the 
explanation of the relations of soul and body, and so changing the 
doctrine of the dualism of the monad as practically to restore the 
Cartesian antithesis of mind and matter. He devoted special attention 
to philosophic method. Indeed, he sometimes carried method to the 
extent of formalism. Wolff is the author of the well-known division of 
metaphysics into <i>ontology, cosmology, psychology</i>, and 
<i>rational theology</i>.<p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. The period from Descartes to Hume was dominated by 
the influence of Cartesian thought, and more particularly by the 
doctrine of the antithesis of mind and matter. It was the attempt to 
solve the problem of this antithesis that gave rise to the pantheistic 
monism of Spinoza, to the materialistic monism of the thoroughgoing 
empiricists, to the idealistic monism of Berkeley, to the partially 
idealistic monadism of Leibniz, and to the pan-phenomenalism of Hume, 
which, -- most astounding solution of all -- solves the problem of the 
antithesis by denying the substantial nature of both mind and matter. 
Here the first act ends. Kant next appears, and, appalled at the sight 
of the ruin which Hume has wrought, fearing for the spirituality of the 
soul, the freedom of the will, the existence of God, and the obligation 
of the moral law, opens a new scene by proposing once more the 
question, What are the conditions of knowledge? and prepares the way 
for the  
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p526"></a>
 philosophy of the nineteenth century by his attempt at constructive 
synthesis on the basis of moral consciousness.<p>

We cannot fail to remark, also, in the development of philosophy from 
Descartes to Kant, a <i>struggle between the purely scientific view and 
the aesthetic religious view of the world</i>. Wherever empiricism held 
full sway, there the scientific view prevailed, and enlightenment, as 
it was called, was sought, rather than a deeper sense of the aesthetic 
and spiritual significance of things. Wherever, on the contrary, the 
idealistic movement prevailed, there greater value was attached to the 
spiritual and aesthetic solution than to the scientific solution of the 
problems of philosophy. But in spite of idealistic reactions, the 
principles of deism continued to pervade English thought, the 
illumination continued to flourish in France and Germany, and 
Empiricism culminated in the philosophy of Hume, which expresses the 
last and most violent form of antagonism between the scientific and the 
religious aesthetic view of life. It was left for Kant to undo the work 
of the <i>Illuminati</i> and of Hume, and to lay the foundation for the 
constructive systems which were to give to the religious and aesthetic 
interests of human life a place beside the merely scientific elements 
of thought in a complete synthesis of philosophical knowledge.<p>

Finally, we must observe in the eighteenth century a gradual increase 
in the importance attached to the study of man in his social and 
political relations, and the growth and development of the idea of an 
antithesis between the individual and the state. But while Rousseau was 
giving expression to the doctrine of <i>individualism</i> in its most 
extreme form, Herder, by his doctrine of the organic union of the human 
race, was preparing the way for the political philosophy of the 
nineteenth century. For the new century was to discard the notion of 
antithesis between the individual and the state, and, adopting an 
organic instead of a mechanical concept of society, was to substitute 
for the <i>individualism</i> of the eighteenth century a 
<i>collectivism</i>,

 which not only the great speculative systems such as Hegel's, but all 
the other important movements of the nineteenth century -- the 
evolution hypothesis, the rise of romanticism in literature, the Oxford 
movement, and the great industrial and commercial centralization of 
recent years -- were to exemplify and confirm in theory or in 
practice.<p>
