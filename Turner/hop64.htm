GERMAN PHILOSOPHY (<i>Continued</i>)</h3><p>

Kant's philosophy was opposed by the exponents of Wolffian dogmatism, 
such as <b>Eberhard</b> (1739-1809), by the sceptic <b>Schulze</b> 
(1761-1833), by the eclectic <b>Herder</b> (1744-1803), and by 
the Fideists, <b>Hamann</b> (1730-1788) and <b>Jacobi</b> (1743-
1819). It was defended and developed by <b>Reinhold</b> (1758-1823), who 
was successively a Jesuit novice, a member of the Barnabite order, a 
member of the staff of the <i>Deutscher Merkur</i>, and professor 
 <!--
THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT 549 
 --><A NAME="p549"></a>
 of philosophy at Jena and Kiel. With Reinhold are associated 
<b>Salomon Maimon</b> (1756-1800), <b>Krug</b> (1770-1842), who was 
Kant's successor at Konigsberg, and <b>Beck</b> (1761-1840), who, like 
Fichte, attempted to give greater systematic unity to the Kantian 
system. The poet <b>Friedrich Schiller</b> (1759-1805) contributed to 
Popularizing the moral and aesthetic doctrines of Kant.<p>

THE ROMANTIC MOVEMENT<p>

The romantic movement corresponded with the beginning of the era of 
national reconstruction in Germany and was not without effect on the 
development of philosophic thought in that country. It accentuated the 
importance of the spiritual life not only of the individual, but of the 
race, and even in a certain analogical sense of nature itself. <b>Jean 
Paul Richter</b> (1763-1825), whose dialogue on the immortality of the 
soul, entitled <i>Kampanerthal</i>, is less widely known than it 
deserves to be, is one of the first of the romanticists, or, as some 
prefer to consider him, a forerunner of the romantic movement.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> After 
passing through different phases of subordination of individual 
spiritual progress to the general spiritual concept of nature, 
romanticism reached its final form in the writings of <b>Novalis</b> 
(Friedrich von Hardenberg, 1772-1801) <b>Friedrich Schlegel</b>
 (1772-1829), author of <i>Lucinde</i>, turned ultimately from the 
cultus of genius to the profession of the Catholic faith, where he 
found that emancipation from the limitations of the commonplace which 
he had in vain sought in romanticism.<p>

It was Fichte who imparted to the Kantian system its highest systematic 
unity, and at the same time combined the many and diverse elements of 
romanticism in his assertion of the supremacy of the inner 
consciousness and inner spiritual life of the individual.

FICHTE<p>

<b>Life</b>. Johann Gottlieb Fichte was born at Rammenau in Upper 
Lusatia in 1762. After studying at Meissen and at Pforta, he took a 
course of theology at Jena and Leipzig. From 1788 to 1790 he lived at 
Zurich as family tutor. In 1791 he went to K&ouml;nigsberg, and it was 
through Kant's influence that he was enabled to publish, in 1792, his 
<i>Versuch einer Kritik aller Offenbarung</i>. After that he published 
several political treatises. In 1794 he obtained the chair of 
philosophy at Jena and published his <i>Wissenschaftslehre</i>. On 
being dismissed from the University of Jena, he lectured successively 
at Berlin, Erlangen, and, for a brief interval, at K&ouml;nigsberg. In 
1808 appeared the famous <i>Reden an die deutsche Nation</i>, and when, 
in 1810, the University of Berlin was founded, Fichte was appointed to 
a professorship, which he held until his death in 1814.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Fichte's complete works were edited by his son, J. H. 
Fichte, in 1845-1846. Several of Fichte's more important treatises were 
translated by Dr. William Smith under the title, <i>Fichte's Popular 
Works</i> (fourth edition, London, 1889). The <i>Wissenschaftslehre</i> 
was translated by C. C. Everett (<i>Fichte's Science of Knowledge</i>, 
Chicago, 1884), and the <i>Rechtslehre</i> by A. E. Kroeger (<i>The 
Science of Rights</i>, London, 1889). Consult Adamson, <i>Fichte</i> 
(<i>Blackwood's Philosophical Classics</i>, Edinburgh and Philadelphia, 
1892); A. B. Thompson, <i>The Unity of Fichte's Doctrine of 
Knowledge</i> (Boston, 1895).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Starting Point and Aim</b>. Fichte is commonly said to hold to Kant 
and Spinoza the same relation that Plato held to Socrates and 
Parmenides. His immediate starting point is Kant's philosophy; his aim 
is to complete and unify what is incomplete and only partially unified 
in that system of thought. Kant was well aware that his theory of 
knowledge as expounded in the <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> was 
incomplete and lacking in coherent unity, but he was not equally 
conscious of the lack of a logical and consistent transition from the 
conclusions of the first critique to the principles with which the 
<i>Critique of Practical Reason</i> and the <i>Critique of Judgment</i> 
begin. It was Fichte's aim, as indeed it was the aim of Schelling and 
Hegel, to supply 
 <!--
FICHTE'S THEORETICAL PHILOSOPHY 551 
 --><A NAME="p551"></a>
 a <i>single principle</i>, an all-embracing formula, which should at 
once complete Kant's analysis of speculative thought and afford a 
systematic and logical basis for the analysis of the data of ethics and 
aesthetics. Such a principle Fichte found in the <i>Ego</i>, which 
takes the place of the thing-in-itself as the ultimate reality, and is, 
moreover, the ultimate in the practical as well as in the speculative 
order. For, in Fichte's <i>doctrine of the Ego</i> we find that 
<i>self</i> does not stand merely for <i>self-consciousness</i>, but 
also for <i>duty</i>. When he styled his most important constructive 
treatise <i>Wissenschaftslehre</i> he did not intend to convey the 
impression that his philosophy is merely an account of the methods of 
scientific research; he meant rather that it is a science of knowledge, 
understanding by knowledge the sum total of our experience as it 
presents itself in consciousness; so that philosophy may be defined as 
a <i>rethinking in self consciousness of the experience which is 
presented as a completed whole in direct consciousness</i>.<p>

It is usual to distinguish the earlier and the later forms of Fichte's 
philosophical system.<p>

<b>Earlier Form</b>. Here we may further distinguish Fichte's 
theoretical and practical doctrines.<p>

A. <i>Theoretical Philosophy</i>. Thought cannot be reduced to being, 
but being can be reduced to thought. Similarly, thought cannot be 
derived from being, but being can be derived from thought. Kant was 
unsuccessful in his synthesis of knowledge because he tried to deduce 
the categories and other forms of thought from the logical relations of 
subject to predicate and, therefore, ultimately from experience. If, on 
the contrary, we deduce the forms of thought from the nature of 
consciousness, we shall find that experience and all its noumenal 
content (the thing-in-itself) are capable of being derived from the 
conscious activity of the <i>Ego</i>, -- from the deed-acts 
(<i>Thathandlungen</i>) of the thinking subject. Thus the 
 thing-in-itself is absorbed, so to speak, in the subject, and instead 
of ultimate dualism we have idealistic monism. The <i>Ego</i>, and the 
<i>Ego</i> alone, is real. We 
 <!--
552 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p552"></a>
 need not go beyond experience to find the ultimate reality, but in our 
analysis of experience we abstract the <i>Ego</i>, which is, therefore, 
transcendental though not transcendent.<p>

<i>The three principles</i>. Taking up now the <i>deed-acts</i> of 
consciousness, we find that in every act of self-contemplation we 
affirm, or posit, the identity of subject and object, -- the self as 
representing and the self as represented. We have, therefore, the first 
principle, -- "The <i>Ego</i> posits itself." It is hardly necessary to 
point out that by <i>Ego</i> Fichte does not mean the individual, but 
the universal self-consciousness, the <i>I-ness (Ich-heit)</i>. Take 
the proposition A = A. It posits nothing about A; for A is for the 
<i>Ego</i> simply and solely by virtue of being posited by the 
<i>Ego</i>. Therefore the nexus between A and A is the position of the 
<i>Ego</i>, the affirmation that <i>I am</i>.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> What, considered in 
the abstract, is the logical law of identity, is, in its application to 
objects, the (only) category of reality. But if we continue our 
examination of the facts of empirical consciousness, we find there a 
certain opposition, which may be expressed in the general formula Not-A 
is not equal to A (not to be confounded with Not-A = Not-A, which is a 
case of identity), and if we treat this proposition as we treated the 
first, we find that it means that in the <i>Ego</i> the <i>non-Ego</i> 
is opposed to the <i>Ego</i>. Here we have the second principle, -- "A 
<i>non-Ego</i> is opposed to the <i>Ego</i>." Now, since the <i>Ego</i> 
is the only reality, it is through the <i>Ego</i> that the
 <i>non-Ego</i> is posited and the <i>Ego</i> denied. Therefore the 
<i>Ego</i> both posits and negates itself. It is, however, as 
fundamental for Fichte as it was for Spinoza that all negation is 
limitation. Therefore the <i>Ego</i> in part negates the
 <i>non-Ego</i>, and the <i>non-Ego</i> in part negates the <i>Ego</i>,  
-- which is the third principle. In this thesis, antithesis, and 
synthesis we find the germ of the Hegelian triadism. It is important to 
note also that Fichte identifies the <i>Ego</i> with self-activity, and 
teaches that it exists not only for itself (<i>f&uuml;r sich</i>) but 
through itself (<i>durch sich</i>). 
 <!--
FICHTE'S PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY 553 
 --><A NAME="p553"></a><p>

From these principles Fichte deduces not only the fundamental laws of 
thought, but also the fundamental laws of being, -- the law of 
causation, the principle of sufficient reason, etc.<p>

The question, however, remains to be answered, Why does the <i>Ego</i> 
interrupt the unbroken activity by which it posits itself? Why does it 
posit the <i>non-Ego</i>? Fichte, we have already said, regards the 
idea of duty as no less essential to the <i>Ego</i> than the idea of 
self-consciousness. Taking up, therefore, the moral aspect of the 
<i>Ego</i>, he answers that <i>effort and struggle</i> are necessary 
for the attainment of the highest good. The <i>Ego</i> posits the 
<i>non-Ego</i> in order to make effort and struggle possible; the 
<i>Ego</i> is theoretical, in order to be practical: it represents a 
<i>non-Ego</i> in order to act upon it, to overcome its limitations, and 
thus to make it disappear in the <i>Ego</i>. This consideration is the 
basis of practical philosophy.<p>

B. <i>Practical Philosophy</i>. Without conflict there is no morality. 
Activity is, therefore, the essence of morality, and inertness is the 
radical evil. Man should strive to become self-dependent and thereby 
attain independence and freedom. To this general maxim is added the 
special rule of conduct for each individual: Always follow the inner 
necessity which urges you to attain to freedom through action; fulfill 
your vocation; <i>act according to your conscience</i>.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Besides this internal necessity (<i>conscience</i>), Fichte admits an 
external necessity, namely <i>right</i>, which has exclusive reference 
to external conduct, just as conscience refers to internal disposition. 
Although right is external, it originates from the <i>Ego</i>; for as 
in general the <i>Ego</i>, in positing itself, posits also the
 <i>non-Ego</i>, so the practical <i>Ego</i>, in positing itself as a 
free agent, posits the <i>other-self</i>, the <i>thou</i>, as another 
free agent. From the coexistence of free agents arises the limitation 
of the freedom of the <i>Ego</i>, imposed by the necessity of 
respecting the freedom of others: this necessity is right. The <i>law 
of right</i> is, therefore, 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 554  
 --><A NAME="p554"></a>
 So limit thy freedom that others may be free along with thee. When 
this limitation is not observed and the freedom of others is infringed, 
it is the duty of the <i>State</i> -- not of the individual who is 
injured -- to interfere and enforce the observance of the limitations 
of freedom. And, as it is the duty of the State to safeguard the rights 
of its subjects, it is the mission of the Church to impress on all men, 
by means of symbols, the limitations of the individual, and by so doing 
to deepen and strengthen moral convictions.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Later Form</b> of Fichte's philosophy. During the last years of his 
life Fichte devoted special attention to the political and religious 
aspects of his philosophy of self-consciousness. His <i>Addresses to 
the German Nation</i> contributed much to the growth of the national 
ideal among his fellow-countrymen, an ideal which was realized in the 
educational and political reconstruction of the country during the 
latter half of the nineteenth century. In the later expositions of the 
<i>Science of Knowledge</i>, he developed his religious philosophy, 
bringing out into special prominence the truth that in the Deity there 
is something more than self-consciousness, that in piety there is 
something more than moral conduct, and that religion is, therefore, 
something more than philosophy and ethics; for it is peace and life 
and blessed love. The <i>Ego</i>, which he had identified with God, he 
now regards as an image of the Absolute (God). Here we see, on the one 
hand, the influence of Spinoza's pantheism, and, on the other, that of 
the Christian doctrine of the Logos.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Fichte's system is the first of a series of 
post-Kantian efforts to reduce the incomplete synthesis which Kant had 
effected to a more compact and coherent form -- by substituting the unity 
of a single formula for the Kantian trinity of <i>idea,
 thing-in-itself</i>, and <i>subject</i>. The formula which Fichte 
proposed was the <i>Ego</i>. From this he deduced all thought and all 
being, including the thing-in-itself; and from the <i>Ego</i> he
 <!--
SCHELLING 555 
 --><A NAME="p555"></a>
 derived all reality, as the Neo-Platonists had derived it from the 
one, and Spinoza from the substance. His philosophy is, therefore, 
monistic. It may be styled a system of subjective idealism, or
 pan-egoism, if when we use the term <i>pan-egoism</i> we remember 
Fichte's protest against identifying the <i>Ego</i> with individual 
self-consciousness. Fichte's relation to Kant and his place in the 
romantic movement are evident in his doctrine of the essentially 
ethical aspect of the activity of the <i>Ego</i>, -- the inclusion of 
duty, or spiritual activity, as well as conscious representation, in 
the notion of self.<p>

SCHELLING<p>

<b>Life</b>. Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph (von) Schelling was born at 
Leonberg, in W&uuml;rtemberg, in 1775. At the age of sixteen he entered 
the theological seminary at T&uuml;bingen, where he studied theology, 
philosophy, and philology. He spent the years 1796-1797 at Leipzig, 
where, while fulfilling his duties as tutor to a young nobleman, he 
studied mathematics and natural science and published his first work, 
<i>Ideen zu einer Philosophie der Natur</i>. In 1798 he was appointed 
to lecture at Jena, where he had Fichte for colleague. From 1803 to 
1841 he taught successively at W&uuml;rzburg, Erlangen, and Munich. In 
1841 he was made member of the Academy of Sciences at Berlin, and 
lectured at the university for several years. He died at Ragatz in 
Switzerland in 1854.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Besides the <i>Ideen</i>, Schelling wrote several 
treatises on the philosophy of nature. He contributed to the philosophy 
of religion and of mythology several important treatises. The most 
systematic of his works is <i>Der transcendentale Idealismus</i>, 
published in 1800. His works were collected and published in fourteen 
volumes by his son (Stuttgart and Augsburg, 1856 ff.). Consult Watson's 
<i>Schelling's Transcendental Idealism</i> (<i>Griggs' Philosophical 
Classics</i>, Chicago, 1882).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>General Character of Schelling's Philosophy</b>. While Schelling was 
a student at T&uuml;bingen, his favorite authors were Kant, Fichte, and 
Spinoza; later he came in contact with Hegel, and was impelled, by way 
of reaction against Hegel's naturalism, 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="_"></a>
 to turn for inspiration to the mysticism of the Neo-Platonists and of 
Jakob B&ouml;hme. Herder and Giordano Bruno also left traces of their 
influence on his philosophy. Schelling was at first a disciple of 
Fichte, but he subsequently transferred his allegiance to different 
schools in succession, and since, as Hegel said, he "carried on his 
studies in public," he expounded successively at least five different 
systems.<p>

<b>First System</b>. Previously to the publication of the <i>Ideas for 
a Philosophy of Nature</i> (1797) Schelling adhered to the doctrines of 
Fichte.<p>

<b>Second System</b>. During the years 1797-1800, the most productive 
period of his literary life, Schelling expounded a philosophy of nature 
and a transcendental philosophy of spirit.<p>

1. <i>Philosophy of Nature</i>. Fichte regarded nature as merely a 
limitation of the <i>Ego</i>, as at most a means to the exercise of 
man's spiritual and moral activity; Schelling advocates the recognition 
of <i>nature as a source of spiritual activity</i>. He teaches that 
nature is not merely object but also subject, not indeed a subject 
fully conscious, or completely awake, but semi-conscious and 
slumbering. We should therefore study nature in order to discover the 
laws by which spirit is developed out of nature into
 self-consciousness. For nature is not the antithesis of spirit, both 
being the products of a higher principle which posits nature (wherein 
it reflects itself imperfectly) and through nature attains to spirit 
(where it reflects itself consciously, and to that extent 
adequately).<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Empirical physics regards nature as mere being, or product; speculative 
physics (the philosophy of nature) looks upon nature as becoming, or 
productive. But, just as Fichte recognized the limitations of the 
activity of the <i>Ego</i>, Schelling limits the productivity of nature 
by positing its essential <i>polarity</i>. If, he observes, there were 
no arrest of productivity, nature would continue striving towards the 
Infinite, and there would be no 
 <!--
SCHELLING'S PHILOSOPHY OF SPIRIT 557
 --><A NAME="p557"></a>
 product; there is, therefore, a retarding as well as a stimulating 
force. All nature is dual; the magnet, with its union of opposite polar 
forces, is the symbol of the life and productive activity of nature. In 
an essay entitled <i>On the World-Soul</i> (1798), Schelling developed 
the idea of an animated nature pervaded by an organizing principle, 
which originates and maintains the conflict of contending forces. Hence 
the inorganic is to be explained by the organic, and, in general, the 
lower by the higher.<p>

2. <i>Transcendental Philosophy of Spirit</i>. The philosophy of spirit 
concerns itself with the phenomena of the spirit as they manifest 
themselves in representation, action, and artistic enjoyment. We have, 
therefore, three divisions of transcendental philosophy.<p>

(a) <i>Theoretical philosophy</i>. Here we start with
 self-consciousness and proceed to explain how it is that we represent 
to ourselves certain images of external reality, or, in other words, 
how it is that in the act of representation we feel compelled, as it 
were, by an external something, to represent in a certain manner. The 
general explanation is that <i>there are two opposing forces</i>, the 
one real and the other ideal, which by their alternate action limit the 
spirit to the state of sensation, then to that of reflection, and 
finally to that of volition, which is at once the culmination of the 
theoretical life and the beginning of the practical life of the spirit.<p>

(b) <i>Practical philosophy</i>. Here we start with impulse, which 
arises from the theoretical activity of the spirit positing the 
distinction between self and not-self, and which differs from that 
theoretical activity by a mere difference of degree. Progress in moral 
life means the gradual overcoming of the <i>non-ego</i>, and the final 
goal of moral striving is <i>complete independence of the ego</i> as 
will. It is only in the initial concept of nature as <i>reproduced</i>, 
not <i>produced</i> by the <i>ego</i>, and in the "supplementary" 
considerations on law, state, and history, that Schelling 
 <!--
558 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p558"></a>
 differs from Fichte in his practical philosophy; both identify moral 
life with independence.<p>

(c) <i>AEsthetic philosophy</i>. In the theory of art Schelling 
introduces Kant's notion of the beautiful, modifying it, as he modified 
Kant's teleological concept, to suit the needs of his more compact 
idealistic system. The <i>beautiful</i>, he teaches, is <i>the perfect 
realization of the union of the sublective and oblective</i>, -- a 
union to which history approximates, but which art accomplishes. In art 
the antithesis between the real and the ideal, between action and 
representation, between impulse and reflection disappears. <i>Art</i> 
is, therefore, the <i>solution of all the problems of philosophy</i>.
<a name="n_6"><a href="#n6">{6}</a></a><p>

<b>Third System</b>. So far Schelling may be said to have extended and 
modified the subjective idealism of Fichte by distinguishing the 
philosophy of nature from that of spirit, and by recognizing as the 
<i>prius</i> of both nature and spirit a common ground or principle 
from which both are deduced. In his third system he emphasizes the 
importance of this principle, which he calls the <i>Absolute</i>, and 
which he defines as the <i>identity of the real and the ideal</i>.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> 
Here the line of thought and even the method and manner of exposition 
are Spinozistic. To the philosophy of nature and the transcendental 
philosophy of spirit, which still remain as integral portions of the 
system, there is added the <i>philosophy of identity</i>, in which all 
things are viewed <i>sub specie aeterni</i>, and are thus led back to 
the Absolute, God, in Whom they are identified. It is important, 
however, to note that the identification of the real and the ideal in 
the Absolute is complete, not because of the power of the Absolute to 
develop the real and the ideal, but because of its 
<i>indetermination</i> . On account of this indetermination Schelling's 
Absolute was compared by Hegel to the night in which all cows are 
black.
 <!--
HISTORICAL POSITION OF SCHELLING 559 
 --><A NAME="p559"></a><p>

In the derivation of the real from the Absolute we are to distinguish 
<i>three moments: gravity, light</i>, and <i>organization</i>. The 
organic concept of nature is, however, preserved; for even in the first 
moment organization is present, inasmuch as the inorganic is the 
residuum of the organic, -- that which failed to attain complete 
organization.<p>

<b>Fourth System</b>. In the fourth system Schelling, after the manner 
of the Neo-Platonists, accounts for the origin of the universe by a 
"breaking away," or "falling off," from the Absolute. In the previous 
system the world was swallowed up, so to speak, in the indifference of 
the Absolute; now it is placed in striking contrast with it, and the 
independence of the Absolute is emphasized. We find in this fourth 
system a fuller and deeper realization of the problem of evil, and at 
least an implied confession of the inability of monism to account 
satisfactorily for the existence of evil in the world.<p>

<b>Fifth System</b>. This may be briefly described as a theogony and 
cosmogony after the manner of Jakob B&ouml;hme.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Schelling's philosophy is deserving of 
careful study both by reason of its intrinsic importance and of the 
influence, direct and indirect, which it exerted on other systems. 
It offers, however, more than usual difficulty because of the wealth of 
imaginative power which Schelling brought to bear on even the most 
abstruse problems of metaphysics, and also because of the successive 
change of view in the five periods into which his mental history is 
divided. Taking the third system, the philosophy of identity, as the 
most typical stage in the development of Schelling's thought, we may 
describe it as a system of idealistic monism in which subject and 
object are identified in the indifference of the Absolute. Thus it 
stands contrasted, on the one hand, with the subjective idealism of 
Fichte, and, on the other, with the dynamic idealism of Hegel, who 
identified subject and object in an Absolute which is 
 <!--
560 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p560"></a>
 universal, not because it is indifferent, but because in it all 
differences are immanently contained.<p>

Before we pass to the study of Hegel, mention must be made of the 
disciples and co-workers of Schelling, who represent different phases 
of his philosophy of nature and his philosophy of religion. Among the 
naturalists influenced by Schelling are <b>Steffens</b> (1773-1845), 
<b>Oken</b> (1779-1851), <b>Schubert</b> (1780-1860), and <b>Carus</b> 
(1789-1869), all of whom were distinguished in their day as biologists, 
physicists, or psychologists. Among the philosophers of religion whom 
Schelling influenced, the two best known are <b>Baader</b> (1765-1841), 
who, from the Catholic standpoint, attempted a religio-philosophical 
synthesis of Neo-Platonism, Scholasticism, post-mediaeval mysticism, 
and German transcendental philosophy, and <b>Schielermacher</b> (1768-
1834), who, from the Protestant standpoint, endeavored to combine the 
most varied elements in an eclectic philosophy of religion.<p>
