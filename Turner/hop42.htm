<h3 align="center">CHAPTER XLII<br>
AVERROISM IN THE SCHOOLS</h3><p>

When, in the first decades of the thirteenth century, the Greek text of 
Aristotle was introduced into the schools and the Christian 
philosophers began to compose commentaries on the Latin translations 
made from it, the followers of the Arabian commentators commenced to 
give a more decidedly Anti-Christian direction to their interpretation 
of Aristotle. In this way there sprang up two hostile schools of 
Aristotelianism, -- the orthodox Aristotelianism of the schoolmen and 
the heterodox Aristotelianism of the Averroists. The unity of the 
active intellect, the immortality of the individual soul, the freedom 
of the will, and the question of fatalism were some of the points on 
which the schoolmen and the Averroists differed in their interpretation 
of the philosopher. But the most characteristic doctrine of the 
Averroists, a doctrine which involved the denial of the most vital 
principle of Scholasticism, was that <i>what is true in philosophy may 
be false in theology</i>, and <i>vice versa</i>.<p>

Towards the end of the thirteenth century Averroism appeared in the 
University of Paris, and was made the subject of several ecclesiastical 
inquiries and condemnations. Its chief representatives were <b>Siger of 
Brabant</b><sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> (died 1282 or 1288), <b>Boetius the Daclan</b>, and 
<b>Bernier of Nivelles</b>.

Among the opponents of Averroism are to be reckoned the great 
schoolmen, who, like Albert and St. Thomas, composed treatises for the 
express purpose of refuting the doctrines of the Averroists, and 
controversialists, like <b>Raymond Lully</b>, who under. took an 
extensive campaign against the errors of the Arabians.<p>

RAYMOND LULLY<p>

<b>Life</b>. Raymond Lully, <i>Doctor Illuminatus</i>, is in some 
respects one of the most remarkable figures in the history of mediaeval 
philosophy. His whole life was dominated by the idea of converting the 
Moorish world to Christianity. This he hoped to accomplish by the 
preaching of the gospel, by the refutation of the errors of the 
Arabians, and by the scientific demonstration of the revealed truths of 
the Christian religion. He was an apostle, a controversialist, and a 
theosophist. He was also an inventor, having contrived, among other 
things, a logical machine by means of which he hoped to prove all 
truth.<p>

Raymond was born at Majorca in 1234 or 1235. After spending some years 
at the court of Aragon, he entered the order of St. Francis<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> and 
devoted the remainder of his life to the conversion of the Moors. He 
was stoned by the Mussulmans at Tunis in 1315.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Raymond's works occupy eleven folio volumes in the 
Mainz edition (1721-1742). The most important of his treatises, <i>Ars 
Brevis, Duodecim Principia Philosophiae</i>, and <i>Ars Magna</i>, were 
published at Strasburg in 1651.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Raymond's <i>theosophy</i> appears in the doctrine that all truths, 
including the mysteries of faith, are demonstrable by human reason. The 
doctrine, however, is not to be understood in the rationalistic sense: 
for Raymond maintains that reason, in order to attain the highest 
truths, must be aided by faith:<p>

<blockquote>
Et sicut voluntas non posset amare objectum primum sine charitate, sic 
intellectus non potest intelligere primum objectum sine fide.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
RAYMOND LULLY 395 
 --><A NAME="p395"></a>
<br><br>
Qui bene scit cognoscere et intelligere res quae consistunt in 
intellectu et sensibiles, optime potest intelligere et cognoscere si 
voluerit, quod sicut esset dissonum rationi quod tres Dii essent, sic 
esset dissonum quod tres persona divinae non essent.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

The logical machine which Raymond invented seems to have been contrived 
and constructed on the principle that not only are ideas 
representations of realities but the combinations of ideas are 
representations of the truth existing in real things. The machine was 
made up of letters, which symbolized the elements of thought, and of 
different geometrical figures, such as circles, squares, triangles, 
etc., along which the letters could be moved so as to form different 
combinations, each resultant combination representing a conclusion and 
each process of movement representing a proof. It is possible that 
Raymond was led to the idea of constructing a logical machine by his 
study of the cabalistic philosophy of the Jews. He frequently expresses 
his great admiration for what he calls the <i>superabundans 
sapientia</i>, the mystic doctrine of Jewish philosophy:<p>

<blockquote>
Est igitur Kabbala habitus animae rationalis ex recta ratione divinarum 
rerum cognitivus; propter quod est de maximo etiam divino, consequutive 
divina scientia vocari debet.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Raymond's contemporaries did not agree as 
to the value of his contributions to philosophy and theology. Some 
regarded him not only as orthodox in his teaching but as specially 
illumined from on high -- <i>Doctor Illuminatus</i>: they commented on his 
works, and provided for the foundation of special chairs to perpetuate 
his doctrines in the universities of Barcelona and Valencia. Others, on 
the contrary, so vehemently denounced his teachings as heterodox that 
the inquisitor of Aragon was instructed to draw up a list of 
propositions from the writings of Raymond and forward it to Rome. It is 
uncertain whether the propositions were formally condemned: it is,

 however, generally admitted that, were it not for the savor of 
heterodoxy attaching to his doctrines, Raymond would have been 
canonized.<p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. Before passing to the fourth period of Scholastic 
philosophy, let us look back at the period which we have just studied. 
It is the Golden Age of Scholasticism. During the thirteenth century 
Christian revelation and scientific knowledge were harmonized in the 
great synthetic systems of Christian philosophy; the dogmatic doctrines 
of the Patristic period were welded into a more consistent body of 
theological speculation; the whole range of human knowledge was 
surveyed, and whatever was found to be true was given its proper place 
in systems of constructive thought. It was an age of vast creative 
enterprises in the world of speculation. It was an age on which the 
Christian philosopher and the Christian historian who have begun to 
understand it love to dwell. They realize that it was not a dark age 
but an age of enlightened faith, which more than any other understood 
the paramount importance of the supernatural element in life, and 
which, while it gave to reason its legitimate rights, was more willing 
than any other age to give unto God the things that are God's. During 
the thirteenth century the Church triumphed in Italy in the temporary 
rule of her Visible Head: she triumphed throughout the Holy Roman 
Empire in the acknowledgment which emperors made of their dependence on 
the Holy See;<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> but it was in the Christian schools of Europe, and 
especially of France, that she achieved a still more honorable triumph, 
in the recognition of the true value of theological science and in the 
universal acknowledgment of the principle that there can exist no 
contradiction between the data of revelation and the truths which human 
reason discovers. Soon all this was to he changed; the struggles with 
the Empire, the exile to Avignon, and the western schism were to 
disrupt the external harmony in which sanctity and learning  
 <!--
SCHOLASTICISM OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY 397
 --><A NAME="p397"></a>
 had thriven, while the growing influence of the Averroists and the 
decay of Scholasticism were to bring about the final dissolution of 
Scholastic philosophy by establishing the maxim that what is true in 
philosophy may be false in theology.<p>

The thirteenth century was an age of men rather than of schools: it was 
dominated by the personality of the great masters of Scholasticism. It 
was an age of great intellectual activity. There was not, as is 
sometimes asserted, merely one school, and that an uninvitingly 
orthodox one. The unanimity with which the greatest of the schoolmen 
advocated the fundamental principles of Scholasticism was compatible 
with a considerable degree of variety as to the details of method and 
doctrine. Roger Bacon and Albert the Great advocated the use of 
observation and experiment, and sought to introduce a reform in 
scientific method; St. Thomas refuted pantheism, innatism, and other 
errors, and gave a positive development to Aristotelian philosophy; St. 
Bonaventure formulated a system of Christian mysticism which was 
destined to become the inspiration of the orthodox mystics of later 
times; Henry of Ghent furnished arguments for the refutation of 
scepticism and developed the exemplarism of St. Augustine; and Scotus 
inaugurated an age of criticism and formulated a system of voluntarism 
which should have stimulated the later Scholastics to enlarge and 
strengthen the philosophical synthesis of Scholasticism in presence of 
the dangers which were soon to threaten it. Indeed, it is only the 
superficial student of the thirteenth century who can fail to recognize 
that it was a period of immense intellectual activity.<p>
