<h2 align="center">SECOND PERIOD -- FROM DESCARTES TO KANT</h2><p>

The second period in the history of modern philosophy extends from 
Descartes to Kant, that is, from the beginning of the seventeenth 
century to the end of the eighteenth. It comprises some of the greatest 
modern systems of thought, namely, the philosophies of <b>Descartes, 
Spinoza, Leibniz, Locke, Berkeley</b>, and <b>Hume</b>, the last 
forming, as it were, the connecting link with the period of criticism 
inaugurated by Kant. The period which we are about to study is one of 
dogmatism and empiricism, although it includes, as we shall see, more 
than one system of scepticism, partial or complete. It is a period 
during which intellectual activity within the Church is confined for 
the most part to the domain of theology: philosophy no longer stands to 
theology in the close relation in which it had stood during the Middle 
Ages, and battles, in which the most vital principles of religion are 
involved, are fought outside the Church, and in the domain of 
philosophy. This dissociation of philosophy from theology is one of the 
characteristics of the period.

DESCARTES</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. Ren&eacute; Descartes was born at La Haye, in Touraine, in 
the year 1596. He studied at the Jesuit college of La Fl&egrave;che, 
and throughout his life maintained the most friendly relations with his 
teachers, his greatest regret being their refusal to accept his 
philosophy. On quitting the college of La Fl&egrave;che (1612) he went 
to Paris, where for a time he abandoned all serious study; later, 
however, in obedience to the maxim <b>Bene vixit qui bene latuit</b>, 
which he made the guiding principle of his life, he retired into 
seclusion in a lonely quarter of the city, and there continued his 
studies. In 1617, determined to study the great book of the world, he 
took service as a volunteer in the army of Prince Maurice of Nassau, 
repairing first to Holland, and afterwards to Germany, where he left 
the army of Prince Maurice for that of the Elector of Bavaria. While in 
winter quarters at Neuburg on the Danube, in 1619-1620, he experienced 
the mental crisis of his life, and discovered, as he tells us, "the 
foundations of a wonderful science" -- the principle, namely, that all 
geometrical problems may be solved by algebraical symbols. It was in 
this same mental crisis that the notion of universal methodic doubt 
first occurred to him, as well as the thought that "the mysteries of 
Nature and the laws of Mathematics could both be unlocked by the same 
key."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> After a brief visit to his native place, he took up his abode in 
Holland in 1629, and there published his most important philosophical 
works, the <i>Discours de la m&eacute;thode</i> (1637), <i>Meditationes 
de Prima Philosophia</i> (1641), and <i>Principia Philosophiae</i> 
(1644). At the invitation of Queen Christina of Sweden, he went to 
Stockholm in 1649, where he died in the early part of the following 
year.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Besides the works mentioned in the preceding paragraph, 
Descartes wrote a <i>Trait&eacute; des passions de l'&acirc;me</i> 
published in 1650. Among his posthumous works the most important are 
the <i>Recherche de la v&eacute;rit&eacute; and R&egrave;gles pour la 
direction de l'esprit</i>, published in 1701. His Letters (published 
1657-1667) are important for the understanding of his doctrines. The 
collected works of Descartes were published in 1650 and 1701. Cousin's 
edition (11 vols., Paris, 1824-1826) has long been the standard 
edition. It will doubtless be superseded by the edition which is  
 <!--

 being prepared by Messrs. Adam and Tannery, and of which three volumes 
have already (1901) appeared. With regard to secondary sources, it is 
impossible to give here an adequate list. Mahaffy's <i>Descartes</i>, 
included in <i>Blackwood's Philosophical Classics</i> (Edinburgh and 
Philadelphia, 1894), is an excellent manual for English students of 
Descartes.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> 
  
DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Physical and Mathematical Doctrines</b>. Descartes' contributions to 
the mathematical and physical sciences, important as they are, cannot 
be treated here except in a general way. Descartes is the founder of 
analytical geometry; to the science of algebra he contributed the 
treatment of negative roots and the invention of the system of index 
notation; to physics he contributed the first statement of the "law of 
sines" in reference to the refraction of light. This last point is, 
however, a matter of dispute, the discovery being by some authorities 
attributed to Snellius.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Descartes' Method</b>. Descartes, as is well known, advocates 
<i>universal methodic doubt</i> as the beginning of philosophical 
thinking. During his sojourn at Neuburg, to which allusion has already 
been made, he occupied himself with the project of finding some one 
certain truth and of discovering "the true method of attaining to the 
knowledge of all things of which his mind was capable." With this 
purpose in view he first resolved to get rid of all prejudices acquired 
from books, and to call in question all the principles and conclusions 
of science and philosophy. It is to be remarked that Descartes did not 
propose this method of doubt as a means to be used indiscriminately by 
all; the resolution which he made was merely for his personal use.  
 <!--
DESCARTES' METHOD 449 
 --><A NAME="p449"></a>
 It is to be noted, in the second place, that Descartes excepted from 
his universal doubt truths belonging to theology and to the political 
and moral sciences. Having resolved, then, to doubt everything that his 
predecessors had taught, he proceeded to draw up <i>a set of rules</i> 
for his further guidance. The logic of the schools, he remarked, will 
be of little avail in this systematic inquiry, because it is suited 
rather to the communication than to the discovery of truth. 
Accordingly, he proposed to substitute for the rules of formal logic 
the four following principles: (1) To admit nothing as true which is 
not perceived so clearly and distinctly as to admit of no doubt; (2) to 
divide, as far as possible, every question into its natural parts; (3) 
to pass (synthetically) from the easier to the more difficult; (4) to 
make accurate and complete enumerations, both in seeking middle terms 
and in considering the elements of difficult problems.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

These simple and elementary rules are not difficult of observance. They 
indicate (and this is the point with which we are chiefly concerned) 
<i>the essentially deductive nature of the method</i> which Descartes 
introduced. Indeed, during the winter of 1619-1620, when Descartes 
started out to construct a system of knowledge by the aid of these 
rules, he first applied them to the mathematical sciences, but finding 
the method to be at once easy and fertile of results, and considering 
that the principles of all sciences are derived from first philosophy, 
he determined to apply to all branches of physical and philosophical 
science the method which he had so successfully used in mathematical 
studies. Descartes' own statements preclude all possible doubt as to 
the deductive nature of his philosophical and scientific method:<p>

<blockquote> 
Toute ma physique n'est autre chose que g&eacute;om&eacute;trie, les 
mathematiques sont les principaux fondements sur lesquels j'appuie tous 
mes raisonnements. . . . <i>apud</i> me omnia sunt mathematica in 
natura.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote> 
 <!--
450 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p450"></a><p>

<b>Starting Point</b>. The plan conceived during the winter of
 1619-1620 -- that, namely, of applying to all branches of knowledge 
the mathematical method, which <i>starts from an intuition and proceeds 
by deduction</i> -- was perfected in the <i>Discourse on Method</i>, 
which appeared in 1637, and in the <i>Meditations</i>, published in 
1641. In these treatises Descartes attempts to discover an 
incontrovertible truth (<i>aliquid inconcussum</i>), known to us by a 
clear and distinct intuition, and from that single truth to deduce all 
science. The truth which he discovers to be beyond all possibility of 
doubt, and which he accordingly selects as the beginning of all 
scientific knowledge, is the fact of his own conscious thought. I may 
doubt, he observes, about everything else, but I cannot doubt that <i>I 
think</i>, for to doubt is to think. But if I think, I exist; "Cogito, 
ergo sum."<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup><p>

To this Gassendi objected that one may infer existence from any 
external action, such as walking, and argue <i>Ambulo, ergo sum</i>. 
But Descartes protested that the <i>ergo sum</i> is not an inference, 
as indeed it cannot be if <i>Cogito</i> is the <i>first truth</i>; it 
is, however, evident that Descartes himself, by the use of the word 
<i>ergo</i>, gave rise to the misunderstanding. The complex 
proposition, therefore, "Cogito, ergo sum," merely expresses the 
undeniable certainty of the self-evident intuition that I think, and of 
the equally self-evident intuition that I exist. No doubt Descartes 
selected <i>thought</i> rather than an external action, such as 
walking, because, though I may be deceived as to whether I am walking 
or not, I cannot be deceived as to whether I am thinking. He felt, too, 
that <i>thought</i> in some way implies <i>existence</i>, and he had, 
perhaps, in mind St. Augustine's <i>Quod si fallor, sum</i>; he does 
not, however, appear to have realized the difference between an 
indirect argument such as St. Augustine's was -- merely a <i>reductio 
ad absurdum</i> of an opponent's contention -- and a direct proof or 
demonstration.  
 <!--
DESCARTES' PROOFS OF THE EXISTENCE OF GOD 451  
 --><A NAME="p451"></a><p>

Descartes might have turned, at this point, to the consideration of 
matter or extension; he might have considered that we have a clear and 
distinct idea of extension, which is as primitive and underived as is 
our idea of thought and thinking-subject; but instead of doing this he 
proceeded, like the mathematician that he was, to deduce all knowable 
truth from the fewest possible premises. He passed, therefore, 
deductively, from his own existence to the existence of God, and from 
the existence of God to the existence of extended matter (external 
world).<p>

<b>The Existence of God</b>. Descartes reduces his proofs of the 
existence of God to two:<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> the <i>a posteriori argument</i> from 
effect to cause, and the <i>a priori</i> argument, which proceeds from 
the idea of God to the existence of God. We take up first the <i>a 
posteriori argument</i>.<p>

Having established the truth that I think and that therefore I exist, 
Descartes goes on, in the Third Meditation, to argue deductively as 
follows: Of the ideas which I find in my mind, some arise from external 
causes, and others from the mind itself. Now, among the ideas which I 
possess is the idea of God, that is, the idea of a most perfect Being. 
This idea, however, cannot have been produced by me; for the fact that 
I doubt proves that I am an imperfect being, and an imperfect being 
cannot cause that which is most perfect. He alone Who is Himself 
endowed with all perfection can produce in my mind the idea of a most 
perfect Being. Therefore, from the idea of God which I possess, I am 
warranted in concluding that God exists.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The existence of God is, then, not an intuitive truth, but rather a 
truth inferred from an intuition of the contents of the mind. The most 
serious flaw in Descartes' <i>a posteriori argument</i> is the 
assumption of the principle of causality. Descartes,  
 <!--
452 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p452"></a>
 it must be remembered, has resolved to doubt about everything, and up 
to this point he has established merely the truth that he thinks and 
that he exists. He has no right, therefore, to assume the principle of 
causality, in virtue of which it is affirmed that whatever perfection 
is in the effect must be also in the cause. If he assumes it in virtue 
of clear and distinct perception, he must abandon the attempt to deduce 
all truth from one intuition. Apart from this flaw, which may be called 
accidental, the argument is intrinsically invalid. It is not true that 
an idea cannot contain representatively a perfection which is neither 
formally nor eminently in the mind that conceives the idea. I may form 
in my mind an idea of the Infinite without possessing the perfections 
which the idea of the Infinite represents. The principle that the 
effect is not greater than the sum of its causes, is true in the order 
of being; but in the argument which we are studying, the effect is in 
the order of representation, while the cause is in the order of 
existence, and <i>the transition from the ideal order to the real order 
is always fallacious</i>.<p>

We next come to the <i>a priori</i>, or, as Descartes calls it, the 
<i>geometrical proof of the existence of God</i>. We find in our minds 
certain ideas possessing properties so fixed and immutable that we 
cannot acquire such ideas without holding to the truth of the 
properties which are necessarily connected with them. We cannot, for 
example, possess the idea of a triangle, and understand what the idea 
means, without admitting that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 
equal to two right angles. Now, when we examine the idea of God we find 
that it is the idea of the most perfect Being, an idea, namely, which 
comprises all perfections, including that of existence. If existence 
were not comprised among the perfections of God, He would not be the 
most perfect Being. Therefore, from the fact that we possess the idea 
of a supremely perfect Being we are warranted in concluding that such a 
Being exists. The argument may be stated in Scholastic form and 
phraseology thus: 
 <!--
DESCARTES' DOCTRINE OF TWO SUBSTANCES 453<p>

<blockquote>
Ens, de cujus essentia est existentia, necessario existit: Atqui Deus 
est ens de cujus essentia est existentia; ergo Deus necessario 
existit.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> 
</blockquote><p>

Descartes' geometrical or ontological argument raised a perfect tempest 
of controversy. It was attacked on all sides as being a mere 
restatement of St. Anselm's argument, as containing an illogical 
transition from the ideal to the real order, and as <i>falsely assuming 
that existence is a perfection</i>. Despite these objections, the 
argument gained many supporters, and remained in honor among the 
Cartesians of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.<p>

Having thus demonstrated the existence of God, Descartes next proceeds 
to infer from the goodness and wisdom of God the veracity of the 
faculties of the human mind, and to build on this basis the whole 
superstructure of philosophy. The <i>circulus vitiosus</i> is flagrant: 
Descartes <i>proves</i> the existence of God and then from the veracity 
of God infers the reliableness of the cognitive powers by which the 
existence of God has been established.<p>

If, Descartes proceeds to argue, our faculties of knowledge are 
reliable, our senses are to be believed when they testify to the 
existence of the external world. The existence of material extended 
being is not known therefore by <i>intuition</i>, but rather by way of 
inference from the primitive intuition of my own existence and from the 
truths deduced therefrom.<p>

<b>Doctrine of Two Substances</b>. By direct intuition, then, we know 
that there is a thinking substance, <i>self</i>, and by inference we 
know that there is an extended substance, <i>matter</i>. Now, substance 
being that which so exists as to need nothing else for its existence 
(<i>res quae ita existit ut nulla alia re indigeat ad existendum</i>), 
it is clear that God alone is, properly and strictly speaking, a 
substance. Mind, however, and matter, since they need nothing for their 
existence except the cooperation of God, 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 454 
 --><A NAME="p454"></a>
 may be called created substances. The essence of mind is thought; the 
essence of matter is extension. Everything that may be predicated of 
mind is a mode of thought, while everything that may be predicated of 
matter is a mode of extension. Mind and matter, therefore, are 
antithetical.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> It remains to see how Descartes applied this doctrine of 
dualism to his concept of nature and to anthropology. But before taking 
up Descartes' philosophy of nature, it will be convenient to gather 
from the foregoing doctrines the principles of Descartes' epistemology.<p>

<b>Descartes' Epistemology</b>. When Descartes makes the veracity of 
God the all-sufficient guarantee for the reliability of our sense 
processes and of our thought processes, he lays down a principle which 
he wishes to be regarded as the ultimate metaphysical basis of 
certitude. But in every system of epistemology principles of psychology 
are implied, and we may ask, for example, by what quality is the 
knowledge which comes from the outside world to be distinguished from 
the knowledge which comes from the world within us? How can I 
distinguish the <i>idea of a thing from the idea of a mere mental 
fancy</i>? How, for instance, does my idea of Julius Caesar differ from 
my idea of Aladdin? Descartes would answer that the mind, being a 
<i>res cogitans</i>, a substance whose very essence is thought, must be 
conscious of all its acts. When, therefore, I am conscious of an idea 
which I myself formed (<i>idea a meipsofacta</i>) I am conscious of 
having formed it; but when an idea comes to me from outside (<i>idea 
adventitia</i>), I am conscious of the non-interference of my will, and 
I know that, whether I will it or not, the idea represents so much and 
no more. Ideas of this latter class must, therefore, be caused by 
something outside the mind, and I <i>conclude</i> that the 
 something-outside-the-mind exists. Descartes is, then, <i>a reasoned 
realist</i>.<p>

Descartes maintains the existence of real substance as well as of real 
qualities; for, if qualities exist, substances exist, since 
 <!--
DESCARTES' PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE 455 
 --><A NAME="p455"></a>
 nothing can have no qualities (<i>Nihili nulla sunt attributa</i>). 
Thus in the <i>Principia Philosophiae</i><sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> he writes: "Ex hoc quod 
aliquod attributum adesse percipiamus concludimus aliquam adesse rem 
existentem sive substantiam cui illud tribui possit." Still, he teaches 
that the secondary qualities, taste, color, etc., of material things, 
are modes of consciousness rather than qualities of real substances. 
There are, indeed, movements of real substances, which movements, on 
being communicated to the nerves or filaments, are conducted to the 
pineal gland, where they come in contact with the mind and are 
perceived by it. It is not, however, the movement of the substance in 
the world outside us that is perceived by the mind, but merely the 
movement of the filaments, which is caused by the movement of the 
external substance. There is, then, a real cause of color, taste, etc.; 
nevertheless, color, taste, etc., being only modes of the subjective 
organism, are, strictly speaking, states of self rather than states of 
not-self. By this doctrine of subjectivism Descartes paved the way for 
the idealism of subsequent philosophers. It was easy for Berkeley, for 
example, to reason away the primary qualities of matter by reducing 
them, as Descartes had reduced the secondary qualities, to states of 
self, and to conclude that the very substance of matter has no 
existence except in thought. Descartes, it must be remembered, is not 
an idealist; he maintains the existence of an external world of matter 
with its qualities, extension and motion; nevertheless, he is justly 
regarded as the founder of modern idealism.<p>

<b>Philosophy of Nature</b>. What is the essence of material substance? 
Descartes, as we have seen, answered that it is extension. The 
secondary qualities are merely states of the perceiving mind, and among 
the primary qualities extension alone is so essential to matter that 
without it matter is unthinkable. Now, from extension proceed the 
divisibility, figurability, and mobility of matter. Of course, the 
principle that matter is 
 <!--
456 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p456"></a>
 nothing but extension would, if pushed to its logical conclusions, 
lead to subjectivism. Descartes taught, as is well known, that the 
<i>essences of things depend on the will of God</i>. Now, the Divine 
Will is immutable; matter, having at its creation been endowed with a 
certain measure of motion and rest, retains this measure unchanged.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> 
Hence the <i>laws of motion</i>: Everything tends to continue in the 
state of rest or of motion in which it is, and changes that state only 
as a result of the interference of some extraneous cause. Thus 
Descartes' notion of matter harmonized with subsequent discoveries. He 
himself inferred from his notion of matter the homogeneousness of 
space, the existence of substance in the interstellar spaces, the 
formation of the universe from a primitively homogeneous mass, the 
explanation of the distinction between solid and fluid bodies, and so 
forth. The only thing that extension confers on matter is mobility; 
<i>matter is essentially inert</i>, and receives its motion from the 
first efficient cause.<p>

Descartes devotes special attention to the application of his 
mechanical concept of nature to <i>dioptrics</i>. He discards the 
entire Scholastic system of forms, accidental and substantial, 
entitative (accounting for the qualities of things) and representative 
(accounting for our knowledge of things), and explains the phenomena of 
light, color, vision, and so forth in terms of motion. All sensations, 
he teaches, including that of light, are accounted for by the motion of 
particles; light itself is a motion -- not, indeed, a vibration 
(Descartes did not advance so far as this) but a horizontal pushing of 
one particle by another. It is needless to remark that, long before the 
days of Descartes, Aristotle denied the emission theory of light and 
held that light is a mode of motion. Descartes, however, advanced 
beyond all his predecessors when he taught<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> that the difference of 
one color from another is due to the varying velocities with which the 
motions of light reach the eye. Not less interesting is the portion of 
 <!--
DESCARTES' PSYCHOLOGY 457
 --><A NAME="p457"></a>
 the <i>Dioptric</i> (Sixth Discourse) in which he anticipates many of 
Berkeley's contributions to the theory of vision.<p>

<b>Psychology</b>. It is in Descartes' psychology that the disastrous 
consequences of his doctrine of the two substances appear. If mind and 
matter are so opposed as to have nothing in common, the <i>union of soul 
and body</i> in man must be merely a mechanical one. The body, Descartes 
teaches, is a machine, so constructed that it carries on its own 
operations by virtue of the impulse received from the soul, which 
Descartes locates in the pineal gland. This portion of the brain is 
selected as the seat of the soul because it is the only part of the 
cerebral substance which is not double, and it is evident, Descartes 
observes, that if the organ of the soul were double, we should perceive 
two objects instead of one.<p>

It is important to note that Descartes attaches to the word <i>mind</i> 
a meaning which is at once narrower than that of the word <i>soul</i> 
and wider than that of the expression <i>thinking faculty</i>. He 
defines mind as <i>res cogitans</i>; but he includes under the term 
<i>thought</i> sensation, imagination, and volition as well as the 
processes of ideation; thought, in fact, he makes synonymous with 
states of consciousness. Thought, however, does not include all the 
vital functions.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In his account of the physiological processes of the body, as well as 
in his doctrine regarding sensation, Descartes has recourse to the 
theory of animal spirits. The only physiological principles which he 
admits are motion and warmth. God, he observes, has placed in the 
hearts of men and animals a vital warmth which promotes the circulation 
of the blood<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> and separates from the blood its finest and most mobile 
particles, which constitute the animal spirits (<i>spiritus 
animales</i>). This fluid ("very subtle wind," as he sometimes calls 
it) conveys the stimulation of  
 <!--
458 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p458"></a>
 the senses to the pineal gland, and, returning through the nerves to 
the muscles, conveys the impulse of motion from the pineal gland to the 
limbs. <i>In animals there is no conscious sensation</i> but only this 
automatic response of the animal mechanism to stimuli; so that when an 
animal on the dissecting table utters what is apparently a cry of pain, 
the noise is, as the Cartesian vivisectionists contended, merely the 
crash of broken machinery. In man, however, the motion of the animal 
spirits, on reaching the pineal gland, enters into the region of 
thought, and thus there arises a <i>passio</i>. In the same way, the 
motion imparted by the mind from the pineal gland leaves the region of 
thought and is an <i>actio</i>. Hence, the contents of the human mind 
(<i>cogitationes</i>) are divided into <i>actiones</i> and 
<i>passiones</i>. Descartes, however, does not maintain this 
distinction in the details of his account of the contents of the human 
mind.<p>

With regard to the origin of ideas, Descartes at one time held a 
threefold classification of ideas, namely <i>innatae, adventitiae, and 
a meipsofactae</i>. He saw fit, however, at a later period, to explain 
that by innate ideas he meant merely natural dispositions of the mind 
which enable it to develop certain ideas. "In the same sense," he 
observes in his answer to Regius,<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> "we say that certain illnesses are 
innate in certain families, by which we mean merely that children are 
born with a disposition for developing those illnesses." None of our 
ideas, therefore, are actually innate. All our ideas are either 
occasioned by our sensations, that is, they come, apparently at least, 
from the world outside and are therefore called <i>adventitiae</i>, or 
result from voluntary combinations of elements of thought, and hence 
are called <i>ideae a meipso factae</i>. Besides these two classes, we 
must distinguish the innate dispositions to develop certain ideas, and 
these dispositions we may describe as innate potencies of ideas.<p>

Descartes contrasts <i>will</i> with mind. The mind is essentially 
limited, while the will is unlimited. We are directly and 
 <!--
DESCARTES' ETHICAL DOCTRINES 459 
 --><A NAME="p459"></a>
 immediately conscious of our power to perform or to omit certain 
actions, and in this power <i>freedom</i> consists.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> From the freedom 
of will comes the power of choosing to assert that which we do not 
understand. The will is, therefore, the source of error.<p>

The <i>passions of the soul</i> form, as we have seen, the subject of a 
special treatise by Descartes. <i>Passion</i>, like every other state 
of consciousness, <i>is a thought</i>: it is not a state of the body, 
for every state of the body is either a figure or a movement. Still it 
is occasioned by the body, for it arises in the following manner. When 
an impression is conveyed to the brain, the animal spirits are 
disturbed and the commotion thus produced results in approach or flight 
or attitude of defense. Now, in the lower animals, this is all that 
takes place. But in the case of man, the mind perceives this commotion 
of the animal spirits, and the thought of the commotion is emotion, or 
passion. Passion, therefore, is a specifically human phenomenon.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> 
According to Descartes; the primitive emotions are six in number: 
<i>admiratio, amor, odium, cupiditas</i> (d&eacute;sir), 
<i>gaudium</i>, and <i>tristitia</i>.<p>

The consideration of the emotions leads us to the next and last 
division of Descartes' philosophy, namely, his ethical doctrines.<p>

<b>Ethical Doctrines</b>. Descartes did not attempt to elaborate a 
system of ethics from the principles of his speculative philosophy. In 
his <i>Letters</i>, and especially in those addressed to Princess 
Elizabeth, daughter of Frederick V of the Palatinate, and in those 
written to Queen Christina, he lays down certain ethical principles 
which betray the influence of the Stoics. The highest happiness, he 
teaches, is to be attained by striving for a knowledge of what is right 
and by cultivating the will in order to strengthen it in its resolve to 
do what is right. Knowledge of God as the author of all things, 
knowledge of the universe as infinite in magnitude, knowledge of the 
soul as distinct from the body, and knowledge of self as part of the 
domestic and civil society, -- these are the greatest aids to the 
attainment of virtue and

 happiness. We should realize the unlimited power of the will; for from 
this feeling of power springs the virtue of magnanimity, which is the 
foundation of all other virtues.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Descartes exercised a profound influence on 
his own and subsequent generations. He stirred the thinking world of 
his time to its very depths. His doctrines left their impress on the 
theology, science, and literature, as well as on the philosophy of the 
seventeenth century. His philosophy was adopted and defended by 
religious orders. He had for patron the Prince of Cond&eacute;, the 
ablest general of the age, and such was the greatness of his fame that 
more than one royal personage sought admission to the ranks of his 
pupils. All this enthusiasm produced, however, a natural reaction 
against his teachings. His works were placed on the Index <i>donec 
corrigantur</i> (November 20, 1663), the Calvinist universities in 
Holland proscribed his writings, and the University of Oxford forbade 
the teaching of his philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> But in spite of all opposition, 
Descartes' influence continued, and it is hardly an exaggeration to say 
that his thought determined the whole course of the development of 
modern philosophy.<p>

Descartes' philosophy is original in form rather than in content. His 
most noteworthy contribution to philosophy is his method. This method 
is, as we have seen, essentially mathematical, the very opposite of 
what is known as the scientific method. Yet, by a strange irony of 
fate, physical science owes more to Descartes than to Bacon, who sought 
to reform the sciences by the introduction of the inductive in lieu of 
the syllogistic process.<p>

Descartes has been compared to Socrates, and indeed he is, in a sense, 
the Socrates of modern thought. He called attention, as Socrates had 
done, to the necessity of studying the nature of thought and the 
conditions of knowledge. But, unfortunately for the subsequent 
development of philosophy, 
 <!--
HISTORICAL POSITION OF DESCARTES 461
 --><A NAME="p461"></a>
 he did not base his system of psychology on experience. All his 
psychological inquiry was vitiated by his preconceived doctrine of the 
absolute antithesis of mind and matter, a doctrine which, by creating 
an imaginary chasm between subject and object, undid all that Socrates, 
Aristotle, and the schoolmen had accomplished. This doctrine is the 
luckless legacy of Cartesianism to modern thought, for "how to bridge 
the (imaginary) chasm between mind and matter" came to be the problem 
which almost every great philosopher since Descartes' time has striven 
in vain to solve.<p>

From this <i>fundamental misconception of the relation between mind and 
matter</i> followed a complete misunderstanding of the purpose of 
philosophical inquiry. After Descartes, philosophy once more becomes 
anthropocentric, -- it reduces itself to the study of individual 
consciousness, to a geometry of deductions from internal experience; 
and the objective world, its origin, plan, and destiny, the place of 
man in nature, and even the existence of an intelligent first cause, 
are all made secondary subjects of inquiry, to be decided according to 
the result of the study of our own consciousness. This inversion of the 
natural perspective is what a modern writer has characterized as the 
"topsy-turveydom of Cartesianism."<p>

To Descartes, too, may be traced the misunderstanding which prevails 
between those who believe in the spirituality of the human soul and 
those who rightly insist on the value of experimental methods in the 
study of psychic phenomena. For the concrete dualistic spiritualism of 
Aristotle and the schoolmen Descartes substituted the absolute 
dualistic spiritualism of Plato, thereby establishing at the outset of 
the modern period an altogether unnecessary antagonism between 
spiritualism and empiricism -- an antagonism which eventually drove the 
empirical psychologist to adopt the materialistic concept of the soul 
as the only concept which justified the study of the correlation 
between psychic phenomena and physiological processes.<p>
