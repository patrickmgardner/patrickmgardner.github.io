SCHOLASTIC PHILOSOPHY</h2><p>

THE centuries which elapsed between the death of St. Augustine and the 
foundation of the Carolingian schools were centuries of barbarian 
invasion and barbarian rule; they witnessed the dismemberment of the 
Roman Empire, the disappearance of the last vestiges of Roman 
civilization in Europe, and the substitution of a civilization of a new 
order. During the lifetime of St. Augustine, the West Goths under 
Alaric besieged and sacked Rome (410). Nineteen years later, the 
Vandals under Genseric overran Numidia and Mauretania and laid siege to 
Hippo. Meanwhile the Vandals from the upper Rhine had invaded Gaul, 
ancient Germany, and Burgundy (407); these invaders were followed (443) 
by the Burgundians, who settled on the upper Rhone and on the Sa&ocirc;ne. 
Later (451) came the Huns under Attila, and last of all, the Franks 
from the lower Rhine, who, towards the end of the fifth century, spread 
over Gaul, destroying every trace of civilization that had survived the 
invasion and occupation of France by the Vandals and the Burgundians. 
In the same century, the Angles and Saxons took possession of Britain, 
and the Visigoths established barbarian rule in Spain. In the sixth and 
seventh centuries the Heruli, the East Goths, and the Lombards 
destroyed whatever remained of Roman civilization in northern Italy.<p>

We can scarcely realize the desolation that during these centuries 
reigned throughout what had been the Roman Empire. The condition of 
France is vividly portrayed by the words of St. Gregory of Tours, who, 
towards the end of the sixth century, 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p238"></a>
 wrote, "Vae diebus nostris quia periit studium litterarum a nobis,"<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup>
and by the verdict of the Benedictine authors of <i>L'histoire 
litt&eacute;raire de la France</i>, that the eighth century was <i>the 
darkest, the most ignorant, the most barbarous</i> that France had ever 
seen. The utter disregard for learning which characterized those 
times may be inferred from the fact that Ambrose of Autpert (died 778) 
was forced to invoke the authority of Pope Stephen III in defense of 
the study of the Scriptures: "Inquiunt multi: non est tempus jam nunc 
disserendi super Scripturas."<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Although surrounded by all the external signs and conditions of 
dissolution and decay, the Church remained true to her mission of moral 
and intellectual enlightenment, drawing the nations to her by the very 
grandeur of her confidence in her mission of peace, and by the sheer 
force of her obstinate belief in her own ability to lift the new 
peoples to a higher spiritual and intellectual life. It was these 
traits in the character of the Church that especially attracted the 
barbarian kings. But, though towards the end of the fifth century 
Clovis became a Christian, it was not until the beginning of the ninth 
century that the efforts of the Church to reconquer the countries of 
Europe to civilization began to show visible results. The Merovingian 
kings -- the "do-nothing kings," as they were styled -- could 
scarcely be called civilized. Even Charlemagne, who was the third of 
the Carolingian dynasty, could hardly write his name.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup>  Still, 
Charles, illiterate as he was, realized the necessity of reviving 
culture and learning throughout his empire. Inspired by this noble 
purpose, he summoned the Church to his aid, invited learned 
ecclesiastics to his court, and founded schools which became centers of 
the new intellectual movement in different parts of Europe. To this 
movement Scholastic philosophy owes its origin.

The Scholastic movement, therefore, which dated from the foundation of 
the Carolingian schools, was from the outset a reaction against the 
intellectual stupor of the times. The movement was at first confined 
merely to the restoration of the study of grammar and rhetoric. Later 
on, dialectic assumed in the schools more importance than it had at 
first possessed, while an impulse to philosophical speculation was 
given by the Neo-Platonism of Erigena and other Irish teachers. Thus, 
during the ninth and tenth centuries there were many attempts at 
forming a system of philosophy, but it was not until the eleventh 
century, when the problem of universals gave the greatest impulse to 
the growth of Scholastic dialectic, that these attempts were 
concentrated into a definite movement. Towards the end of the twelfth 
century the physical and metaphysical writings of Aristotle became 
known to the schoolmen and caused that great outburst of intellectual 
activity which made the thirteenth century the Golden Age of 
Scholasticism. The middle of the fourteenth century marks the beginning 
of the decadent movement which, in the following century, ended in the 
downfall of the Scholastic system. We have, therefore, the following 
division:<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Source</b>. The neglect of the study of the sources of Scholastic 
philosophy on the part of some of its historians, and the apparently 
inexcusable misrepresentation on the part of others, render it 
imperatively necessary that we keep constantly at hand the primary 
sources, the works of the schoolmen themselves. It is from these works, 
and from these alone, that the student will learn the true meaning and 
value of Scholastic philosophy. Many of the writings of the first 
schoolmen are of easy access, being included in Migne's <i>Patrologia 
Latina</i>. Additional primary sources (<i>Beitr&auml;ge zur Geschichte 
der Philosophie des Mittelalters</i>, M&uuml;nster, 1891 ff.) are at 
present being published by Baeumker and others. The works of the 
Scholastics after the time of St. Bernard are not included in Migne's 
Patrology; they are, however, published in separate editions, to which 
attention will be called.<p>

With regard to secondary authorities, the list given by Weber (p. 9 of 
Eng. trans.) will be found complete with the exception of a recent 
work, De Wulf's <i>Histoire de la philosophie 
m&eacute;di&eacute;vale</i> (Louvain, 1900), which is a valuable aid to 
the study of this period. De Wolf's work does not, however, supersede 
St&ouml;ckl's <i>Geschichte der Philosophie des Mittelalters</i>, which 
is still the standard work of reference, although since its publication 
(1864-1866) numerous important documents bearing on the history of 
Scholasticism have been published. It is well for the student to 
remember that, although Haur&eacute;au is referred to as an authority, 
he owes his distinction as an historian to the care with which he has 
studied and edited manuscript sources<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> rather than to the accuracy of 
his appreciations.<p>

Valuable biographical material is to be found in Wetzer und Welte's 
<i>Kirchenlexikon</i>, 12 Bde., 2 Aufl., Freiburg im B., 1886-1901.

THE CAROLINGIAN SCHOOLS 241

<h2 align="center">FIRST PERIOD OF SCHOLASTICISM</h2>
<h3 align="center">Erigena to Roscelin (800-1050) -- The Period of Beginnings</h3><p>

<b>The Carolingian Schools</b>.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> In the chronicles and biographies of 
the Merovingian epoch mention is made of a Scola Palatina at the court 
of Dagobert and of other Merovingian monarchs. It is clear, however, 
that these schools were institutions for the training of court guards 
(<i>bellatores</i>) in the arts of war and in the manners of the 
court.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Before the time of Charlemagne the only thing that the Frank 
was taught was how to fight. The schools which Charlemagne founded were 
intended to teach the Frank to respect knowledge as well as valor. They 
were literary schools, in which at first the programme was very 
elementary, the nobles and clerics who attended being taught merely the 
arts of reading and writing and the rudiments of grammar. The project 
of forming these schools seems to have suggested itself to Charlemagne 
during his sojourn in Italy, where the traditional learning was in part 
preserved by masters who taught the grammar of Priscian and Donatus, 
and read the works of Virgil, Cicero, St. Augustine, Boethius, and 
Cassiodorus. In the famous <i>Capitulary</i> of 787 and in other 
enactments Charles recommended the foundation of the diocesan and 
monastic schools throughout the empire, having previously founded the 
<i>Schola Palatina</i> at his own court, and given to the abbey of 
Fulda the capitulary empowering the abbot to establish a school at that 
monastery.<p>

But although it was Italy that inspired Charles with the idea of 
founding schools throughout the empire, it was Ireland that sent him 
the masters who were to impart the new learning. Ireland, which had 
never formed part of the Roman Empire, and which had escaped the 
invasions of the barbarians, had preserved since the days of its 
conversion to Christianity the tradition of ancient learning, a 
knowledge of Greek and Latin which was now to astonish continental 
Europe. Alcuin, although an Englishman, is justly considered a 
representative of Irish learning; with him is associated Clement of 
Ireland, who assisted in the work of founding the palace school. 
Unfortunately, history has not preserved the names of Clement's 
fellow-countrymen who, during the reign of Charles and throughout the 
ninth century, were found in every cathedral and monastery of the 
empire as well as at the court of the Frankish kings, and were so 
identified with the 
 <!--
242 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p242"></a>
 new intellectual movement that the teaching of the newly founded 
schools was characterized as <i>Irish learning</i>.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> Eric of Auxerre 
(middle of the ninth century), writing to Charles the Bald, testifies 
to the nationality of many of these pioneers: "Quid Hiberniam memorem, 
contempto pelagi discrimine, paene totam cum grege philosophorum ad 
littora nostra migrantem?"<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> We find mention of a <i>Hibernicus 
exul</i>, author of a poem in praise of Charles the Great; of 
<i>Dungal</i>, teacher at Pavia; of another (or possibly the same) 
Dungal who wrote to Charlemagne explaining the eclipse of the sun in 
810 and of a <i>Sedulius Scotius</i>,<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> sometimes identified with the 
Irish poet <i>Sedulius</i>, who was one of the authors most widely read 
throughout the early Middle Ages. Ireland has, therefore, every claim 
to be considered the Ionia of scholastic philosophy.<p>

After the death of Charles and the subsequent division of the empire, a 
reaction set in against the schools in several parts of the empire. 
Lupus Servatus, the celebrated abbot of Ferri&egrave;res, complains of 
the opposition on the part of the "ignorant vulgar who, if they detect 
any fault (in the representatives of the new learning) attribute it, 
not to human weakness, but to some quality inherent in the studies 
themselves."<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> There were some also who, according to Amalarius of 
Metz,<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> reproved the reading even of the Scriptures. These 
reactionaries, however, were silenced by the voice of Eugenius II, who 
encouraged the foundation of schools and the spread of the new 
learning.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> Supported by the highest authority in the Church, the 
movement continued under the successors of Charlemagne, so that, during 
the ninth and tenth centuries, there sprang up besides the palace 
school, which seems to have accompanied the Frankish court from place 
to place, the no less celebrated cathedral and monastic schools of 
<i>Fulda</i> 
 <!--
THE LIBRARY OF THE SCHOOLS 243
 --><A NAME="p243"></a>
 in Germany, and of <i>Utrecht, Li&egrave;ge, Tournai</i>, and <i>St. 
Laurent</i> in the Low Countries. It was in France that the Scholastic 
movement found its first home, and it was in that country also that, 
after the temporary opposition of the reactionary alarmists, the most 
important schools were founded, namely at Tours, Rheims, Laon, Auxerre, 
and Chartres. These homes of the new learning were the scene of the 
first crude attempts of Scholastic speculation, as at a later time the 
University of Paris was the scene of the last and most brilliant 
triumphs of Scholasticism.<p>

It would be a mistake to imagine that philosophy was taught in the 
schools at the beginning. The curriculum of studies at first comprised 
the seven liberal arts, -- that is to say, the trivium (grammar, 
rhetoric, and dialectic) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, 
astronomy, and music).  Little by little, however, the programme was 
extended. Around the problems of dialectic were grouped problems of 
metaphysics and psychology, and gradually philosophy became part of 
the programme of the schools. The magister scholae, or scholasticus, 
as the teacher was called, expounded the text of the author. This was 
the method employed whether the subject was grammar or dialectic or 
any other of the seven branches.<p>

The Library of the Schools.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> 1. Of <i>Aristotle's works</i>, the 
first schoolmen possessed the <i>De Interpretatione</i> and, in the 
tenth century, the <i>Categoriae</i> in Boethius' translation. It was 
only in the twelfth century that the first book of the <i>Analytica 
Priora</i>, the <i>Topica</i>, and <i>De Sophisticis Elenchis</i> 
became known, and it was not until the thirteenth century that the 
physical, sychological, and metaphysical treatises were introduced into 
the schools. These facts explain why during the first and second periods 
of the Scholastic ovement philosophy was almost altogether occupied 
with logical problems.<p>

2. Of <i>Plato's dialogues</i>, the <i>Timaeus</i> was known to the 
Irish monks, possibly in the original. It was known on the continent in 
the translation ade in the fifth century by <i>Chalcidius</i>. Besides 
the <i>Timaeus</i>, the works of St. Augustine and of the
 Neo-Platonists were used as sources from which the first schoolmen 
derived their knowledge of Platonism.<p> 

3. Of the <i>commentators of Aristotle</i>, only <i>Porphyry</i>, whose 
<i>Isagoge</i> cirulated among the schoolmen in Boethius' translation, 
and <i>Boethius</i>, who commented on the <i>Categoriae</i> and <i>De 
Interpretatione</i>, were known to the shoolmen of the first period.<p>

4. <i>Translations and compilations</i> by <i>Marius Victorinus</i> 
(fourth century), <i>Macrobius</i> (fifth century), <i>Claudianus 
Mamertus</i>, and <i>Donatus</i> were read and expounded in the 
schools.<p> 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 244  
 --><A NAME="p244"></a><p>

5. The <i>Neo-Platonic commentaries</i> of <i>Apuleius</i> and 
<i>Trismegistus</i> were also used.<p> 

6. Of <i>Cicero's works</i>, the rhetorical and dialectical treatises 
such as the <i>Topica, De Officiis</i>, etc., were known at least in 
part. Seneca's <i>De Beneficiis</i> and Lucretius' <i>De Rerum 
Natura</i> were also read.<p> 

7. In addition to the genuine works of St. Augustine, the pseudo  
Augustinian treatises, <i>Categoriae Decem, Principia Dialecticae, 
Contra Quinque Haereses</i>, and <i>De Spiritu et Anima</i>, were 
studied by the first Scholastics.<p> 

8. Finally, the library of the first schoolmen included the works of 
<i>Clement of Alexandria</i> and of <i>Origen</i> in Latin 
translations, and the Latin version of <i>Pseudo-Dionysius</i> by 
Scotus Erigena, as well as the commentaries and original works of 
<i>Martianus Capella, Cassiodorus</i>, and <i>Boethius</i>.<p>

FIRST MASTERS OF THE SCHOOLS</h3><p> 

<b>Alcuin</b><sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> (735-804), educated in the famous school of York, 
appeared at the court of Charlemagne in 781, and there for eight years 
taught grammar and dialectic in the palace school. Later he retired to 
the abbey of Tours, where he founded a school which was soon to eclipse 
the palace school itself. Alcuin was distinguished chiefly as a 
grammarian. His contributions to dialectic are of secondary importance; 
and his psychological treatise <i>De Animae Ratione</i> merely 
reproduces the doctrines of St. Augustine. His importance in the 
history of Scholastic philosophy is due to the prominent part which he 
took in the establishment of the first schools.<p>

<b>Fredegis</b>, who was probably a fellow-countryman of Alcuin, taught 
at the palace school about the beginning of the ninth century. After 
Alcuin's death he became abbot of the monastery of Tours.  
 <!--
RHABANUS MAURUS 245  
 --><A NAME="p245"></a><p>

Taking up the problem of the nature of darkness, he proved in a 
treatise, <i>De Nihilo et Tenebris</i>,<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> that both nothing and 
darkness are real beings. On this point, at least, Fredegis is a 
realist. He does not, however, discuss the general question of the 
objective reality of universal ideas.<p>

With Fredegis is associated the unknown author of the treatise entitled 
<i>Dicta Candidi de Imagine Dei</i>.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> The work is virtually an 
attempt at finding in man the image of the Trinity. In spirit and in 
method it is Augustinian.<p>

<b>Rhabanus Maurus</b> (784-856) is one of the most remarkable of the 
first masters of the schools. He was born at Mainz in the year 784.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> 
At the age of eighteen he became a Benedictine monk in the monastery of 
Fulda. Thence he went to Tours, where for six years he studied under 
Alcuin. From Tours he returned to Fulda in order to assume the office 
of teacher. According to Trittenheim, Rhabanus and his new learning 
were regarded with suspicion by Ratgarus, abbot of the monastery of 
Fulda. Rhabanus, however, overcame the opposition of the 
reactionaries.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> He was made abbot of Fulda and later became bishop of 
Mainz. He died in the year 856.<p>

Like Alcuin and Fredegis, Rhabanus is of importance rather as a teacher 
and inaugurator of the new learning than as an independent philosopher. 
It was he who introduced the learning of the schools into eastern 
Germany. In his work <i>De Universo</i><sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> he treats in twenty-two 
books a variety of subjects, -- God, the angels, biblical personages, 
ecclesiastical institutions, astronomy, chronology, philosophy, poetry, 
medicine, agriculture, military tactics, and language. The work is a 
veritable encyclopedia of knowledge. Except in the portions referring 
 <!--
246 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p246"></a>
 to chronology and grammar, it is merely a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the 
traditional teaching.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. These first masters of the schools belong, 
with <b>Isidore of Seville</b> and the <b>Venerable Bede</b>, to the 
<i>Encyclopedists</i> of the period of transition between Patristic 
philosophy and the philosophy of the Middle Ages. They rendered 
inestimable service to the Scholastic movement by their personal 
influence as teachers, while by their writings they summarized and 
helped to popularize the dogmatic and exegetical teachings of the 
Fathers. The encyclopedic scope of their writings is evidence of a 
condition of affairs similar to that which existed in the first schools 
of Greek philosophy. Just as the early Greek philosophers wrote <b>peri 
phuse&ocirc;s</b>, the first schoolmen wrote <i>De Universo</i>. There 
is, however, this difference: that while the philosophical movement in 
the first schools of Greece was independent of the past, the philosophy 
of these first schoolmen was virtually an epitome of the doctrines of 
the Fathers. Erigena was the first of the schoolmen to attempt an 
independent system of philosophical speculation. With Erigena, 
therefore, the first period of Scholastic philosophy begins.<p>
