FOLLOWERS AND OPPONENTS OF OCKAM</h3><p>

Ockam's conceptualism and his attempt to simplify Scholastic psychology 
and metaphysics constituted a reaction against a movement which was a 
source of real danger to Scholasticism -- the ultra-realism of the 
Scotists. And because Ockamism, as it was called, responded to a need 
of the hour, it was accepted on every side, and met with extraordinary 
success. Its triumph, however, was short-lived. Men soon realized that 
the danger which Ockamism introduced was greater than the evil which it 
sought to remedy. Within the period of seven years (1339-1346) three 
official condemnations<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> were launched against it, the first two 
emanating from the University of Paris and the third from Pope Clement 
VI. During the fifteenth century similar decrees were issued, showing 
that the struggle between the Ockamists and their opponents continued 
until the close of the Scholastic era.<p>

Among the first followers of Ockam were <b>Robert Holkot</b> or Holcot 
(died 1349), <b>Gregory of Rimini</b> (died 1358), and <b>John 
Buridan</b> (died about 1360). Of these the most distinguished was John 
Buridan. He was born at B&eacute;thune, towards the end of the 
thirteenth century. Between the years 1320 and 1323 he followed the 
lectures of Ockam at the University of Paris. In 1328 he became rector 
of the university, and for a quarter of a century occupied the first 
place among the advocates of Ockamism, which system he continued to 
defend in spite of

 prohibition and condemnation. No importance is to be attached to the 
story that he was driven from the university and sought refuge in 
Vienna. Buridan developed the nominalistic theory of universals and 
formulated a theory of will, in which he maintained that choice is 
invariably determined by the greater good, and that the only freedom 
which we possess is a power of suspending our choice and reconsidering 
the motives for action. The well-known comparison which gave rise to 
the expression "Buridan's ass" is not found in the works of Buridan, 
although it is possible that he made use of such an illustration in his 
lectures.<p>

During the latter half of the fourteenth century <b>Marsilius of 
Inghen</b> and <b>Peter d'Ailly</b> were the principal defenders of the 
doctrines of Ockam. The former,<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> after having achieved remarkable 
success as a teacher at Paris, served a term as rector of the 
university. About the year 1379 he left Paris, went to Heidelberg, and 
was made rector of the university which had been founded in that city 
in 1356. Peter d'Ailly, surnamed "the Eagle of France," was born at 
Compi&egrave;gne in 1350. In 1380 he became master in the University of 
Paris; later he was promoted successively to the sees of Puy and of 
Cambrai. He was made cardinal in 1411, and died in 1425. With these 
Ockamists is associated Albert of Saxony, who died in 1390.<p>

In the fifteenth century Gabriel Biel (1430-1495) composed a 
<i>Collectorium in Libros Sententiarum</i>, which is an exposition and 
defense of Ockam's doctrines.<p>

Among the opponents of Ockam's philosophy were many of the Scotists 
already mentioned.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> To these may be added the realists, <b>Thomas of 
Strasburg</b> (died 1357) and <b>Dominic of Flanders</b> (died 1500), 
and the theosophist, <b>Raymond of Sabunde</b>. 
 <!--

<b>Raymond of Sabunde</b>, a Spanish physician, was professor of 
philosophy and medicine at Toulouse about the middle of the fourteenth 
century. His principal work, entitled <i>Theologia Naturalis</i>, is 
similar in method and contents to the <i>Ars Magna</i> of Lully. Raymond 
explains the union of philosophy with theology as consisting in the 
ability of each science to establish all truth, whether natural or 
supernatural. Whatever is contained in the book of nature is contained 
in the book of sacred scripture, and whatever is contained in the book 
of sacred scripture is contained in the book of nature. There is, 
however, this difference between the two books, that what is contained 
in the book of nature is contained "per modum probationis," while what 
is contained in the book of sacred scripture is contained "per modum 
praecepti et per modum mandati."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> In this way Raymond breaks down the 
distinction which the schoolmen of the preceding age placed between the 
natural and the supernatural orders of truth -- a distinction which 
is as essential to the true doctrine of Scholasticism as is the 
absence of contradiction between the two orders.<p>

The general tendency of Raymond's thought was towards realism rather 
than towards nominalism or conceptualism. There is also traceable in 
his writings a leaning towards the mystic school of philosophy, and 
although he does not formulate the principle "Amo ut intelligam," he 
evidently attaches very great importance to the contemplative love of 
God as a factor in man's spiritual life:<p>

<blockquote> 
Amor complet omnia, quia primo per amorem omnes creaturas ordinavit 
Deus ad hominem, deinde homo per amorem conjungitur et colligatur Deo. 
. . . Solus amor facit hominem bonum vel malum. . . . Virtus non est 
aliud quam amor bonus, et vitium non est aliud nisi amor malus.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

While Raymond was teaching theosophical mysticism in France and Spain, 
another and very different form of mysticism was being developed in the 
schools of the Low Countries.<p>
