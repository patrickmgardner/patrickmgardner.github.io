<h2 align="center">THIRD PERIOD OF SCHOLASTICISM<br>
Alexander of Hales to Ockam (1200-1300)</h2><p>

The second period in the history of Scholastic philosophy was the 
period of storm and stress; the third is the period of relative 
perfection -- the Golden Age of Scholasticism. The twelfth century 
was a century of criticism and controversy; the thirteenth 
 <!--
INTRODUCTION OF THE WORKS OF ARISTOTLE 319 
 --><A NAME="p319"></a>
 is a century of synthesis and construction. The great masters of 
Scholastic thought in the thirteenth century take as lively an interest 
in the problem of universals as Roscelin and Abelard did; they have all 
Abelard's relish for the use of dialectic, without any of his frivolous 
love of display; they are not less appreciative of the value of piety 
and contemplation than the Victorines were; they are as keenly alive to 
the advantages to be gained from the learning of the Greeks and 
Arabians as were the members of the school of Chartres; in a word, they 
neither despise nor neglect what their predecessors accomplished, but, 
going beyond the limits which circumstances set to the speculations of 
their predecessors, they carry the Scholastic idea and the Scholastic 
method into new regions of inquiry and succeed in constructing the 
great Scholastic systems of metaphysics and psychology. The schoolmen 
of the thirteenth century are not, like their predecessors, condemned 
to work and think in a milieu unfavorable to constructive speculation. 
The time is ripe for vast constructive attempts. From the union of the 
Latin and German races there has sprung up a new Europe, dominated 
everywhere by Christian ideals; the new civilization has reached its 
complete development, and the time has come for Christian thought to 
put forth its best efforts.<p>

There were three events which more than any others influenced the 
development of Christian thought at the beginning of the thirteenth 
century: the introduction of the works of Aristotle, the rise of the 
universities, and the foundation of the mendicant orders.<p>

 <!--
320 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p320"></a><p>

The schoolmen of the eleventh and twelfth centuries were, for the most 
part, acquainted with Aristotle merely as a master of dialectic. 
Indeed, it was not until the time of John of Salisbury that even the 
<i>Organon</i> was known to Christian philosophers in its entirety. It 
is true that some of the physical doctrines of Aristotle were known to 
the members of the school of Chartres, but it was only at the beginning 
of the thirteenth century that all the physical, metaphysical, and 
ethical treatises of Aristotle were translated into Latin and became 
part of the library of the schoolmen.<p>

The first translations were made <i>from the Arabic</i>, probably 
through the medium of the Hebrew. The work of translating, begun in the 
eleventh and twelfth centuries by <b>Constantine the African, Adelard 
of Bath</b>, and <b>Herman the Dalmatian</b>, was systematized between 
the years 1130 and 1150 by <b>Raymond</b>, bishop of Toledo, who 
founded a college of translators. To this college belonged <b>John 
Avendeath</b> (Johannes Hispanus), <b>Dominicus Gundisalvi, Alfred de 
Morlay, Gerard of Cremona</b> (1114-1187), and, at a later time (about 
1230), <b>Michael Scott</b><sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> and <b>Herman the German</b>. The 
translations, as has been said, were often made through the medium of 
Hebrew. This is true of the translations of commentaries and possibly 
also of the translations of the text of Aristotle's works. Renan<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> 
says of the commentaries of Averro&euml;s, "The printed editions of his 
works are a Latin translation of a Hebrew translation of a commentary 
made upon an Arabic translation of a Syriac translation of a Greek 
text."<p>

The translations made directly from the Greek are, as a rule, of later 
date than the translations from the Arabic. Before the year 1215 or 
1220 none of Aristotle's works except the <i>Organon</i> was translated 
from the Greek. It was after the year 1240 that <b>Robert Greathead</b> 
(1175-1253)<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> translated Aristotle's <i>Ethics</i>, and <b>Henry of 
Brabant</b> and <b>Thomas of Cantimpr&eacute;</b> translated some other 
portions of Aristotle's works. About 1260 <b>William of Moerbeka</b>, 
at the request of St Thomas, and, as it appears, of Urban IV, 
translated the complete works of Aristotle into Latin. This version, 
known as the "translatio nova," imperfect as it was, held its place as 
the authoritative translation of Aristotle till the dawn of the era of 
the Renaissance, although it is evident that in St. Thomas' time there 
were several other translations in use.<p>

In the light of the foregoing facts the attitude of the Church towards 
the study of Aristotle's works is seen to be perfectly consistent. 
When, in 1210, 
 <!--
RISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES 321 
 --><A NAME="p321"></a>
 the provincial Council of Paris, which condemned the doctrines of 
Amaury and David of Dinant, prohibited the reading of Aristotle's works 
and the commentaries thereon ("nec libri Aristotelis de naturali 
philosophia nec commenta legantur Parisiis publice vel secreto"), the 
prohibition was directed against the Arabian translations rendered into 
Latin and against the Arabian commentaries. When, in 1215, Robert of 
Cour&ccedil;on, the papal legate, drew up the statutes for the guidance 
of the masters of the University of Paris, and therein forbade the 
reading of the physical and metaphysical treatises, the regulation once 
more referred to the Arabian Aristotle. When, in 1231, Gregory IX 
directed that the <i>libri naturales</i> be expurgated of errors, it 
was a sign that the true Aristotle was beginning to be distinguished 
from the false, and, indeed, in 1254 we find the writings of Aristotle 
prescribed by the Faculty of Arts as text-books for the masters' 
lectures in the University of Paris. The Aristotle that was twice 
condemned was professedly hostile to Christianity. To the controversies 
of former centuries Aristotle had contributed merely the weapons of 
dialectical debate: but as soon as translations were made from the 
Arabic, and Arabian commentaries were appended to them, Aristotle's 
works were made to yield material for a new rationalism and a new 
pantheism essentially hostile to Christian faith and to theism. When, 
however, translations were made from the Greek text, it became clear 
that Peripateticism and Scholasticism were by no means hostile to each 
other; and from the time of Alexander of Hales onward Aristotle's 
philosophy was made the basis of a rational exposition of dogma: 
Aristotle became for the schoolmen what Plato had been for the Fathers,  
--  "praecursor Christi in naturalibus."<p>

RISE OF THE UNIVERSITIES<p>

<b>Authorities</b>. For the history of the University of Paris, with 
which we are chiefly concerned here, the authorities, besides Du 
Boulay's <i>Historia Universitatis Parisiensis</i> (a very uncritical 
work), are Denifle's <i>Chartularium Universitatis Parisiensis</i> 
(1889-1891) and <i>Die Entstehung der Universit&auml;ten des 
Mittelalters bis 1400</i> (1885); Rashdall's <i>Universities of Europe 
in the Middle Ages</i>, Vol. I (Oxford, 1895); Laurie's <i>Lectures on 
Rise, etc., of Universities</i> (London, 1886), a work not always 
reliable; Feret's <i>La facult&eacute; de th&eacute;ologie de Paris</i> 
(Paris, 1894); and articles in <i>Catholic University Bulletin</i>, July, 
October, 1895.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The event which is now universally admitted as the starting point of 
the history of the University of Paris is the union of the masters and 
students of 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 322  
 --><A NAME="p322"></a>
 the schools in the island into a corporation (<i>Universitas 
Magistrorum et Scolarium</i>) under the presidency of the chancellor of 
the cathedral. This event took place about the end of the twelfth 
century. During the first decades of the thirteenth century the 
<i>faculties</i> were organized. About the same time the <i>nations</i> 
were organized among the students and the masters of the faculty of 
arts, and a struggle began between the rector of the nations and the 
chancellor of the university.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> Privileges bestowed both by the popes 
and the French kings extended the influence and prestige of the 
university; Paris became the "city of books," the center of the 
intellectual life of Christian Europe, and the scene of the greatest 
triumphs of Scholasticism. It was at Paris all the great masters 
studied and taught, and so intimately is the history of Scholastic 
philosophy connected with the University of Paris, that to understand 
the conditions in which Scholasticism attained its highest development 
it is necessary to know something of the arrangements made for the 
study of philosophy at the university.<p>

By statutes issued at various times during the thirteenth century it 
was provided that the professor should <i>read</i>, that is, expound, 
the text of certain standard authors in philosophy and theology. In a 
document published by Denifle,<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> and by him referred to the year 1252, 
we find the following works among those prescribed for the Faculty of 
Arts: <i>Logica Vetus</i> (the old Boethian text of a portion of the 
<i>Organon</i>, probably accompanied by Porphyry's <i>Isagoge</i>); 
<i>Logica Nova</i> (the new translation of the <i>Organon</i>); 
Gilbert's <i>Liber Sex Principiorum</i>; and Donatus' 
<i>Barbarismus</i>. A few years later (1255), we find the following 
works prescribed: Aristotle's <i>Physics, Metaphysics, De Anima, De 
Animalibus, De Coelo et Mundo, Meteorica</i>, the minor psychological 
treatises, and some Arabian or Jewish works, such as the <i>Liber de 
Causis</i> and <i>De Differentia Spiritus et Animae</i>.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> The first 
degree for which the student of arts presented himself was that of 
bachelor. The candidate for this degree, after a preliminary test 
called <i>responsiones</i> (this regulation went into effect not later 
than 1275), presented himself for the <i>determinatio</i>, which was a 
public defense of a certain number of theses against opponents chosen 
from the audience. At the end of the disputation, the defender summed 
up, or "determined," his conclusions. After determining, the bachelor 
resumed his studies for the licentiate, assuming also the task of 
"cursorily" explaining to junior students some portion of the 
<i>Organon</i>. The test for the degree of licentiate consisted in a 
<i>collatio</i>, or exposition of several texts, after the manner of 
the masters. The student 
 <!--
THE MENDICANT ORDERS 323 
 --><A NAME="p323"></a>
 was now a licensed teacher; he did not, however, become magister, or 
master of arts, until he had delivered what was called the 
<i>inceptio</i>, or inaugural lecture, and was actually installed 
(<i>birrettatio</i>). If he continued to teach he was called 
<i>magister actu regens</i>; if he departed from the university or took 
up other work, he was called <i>magister non regens</i>. It may be said 
that, as a general rule, the course of reading was: (1) for the 
bachelor's degree, grammar, logic, and psychology; (2) for the 
licentiate, natural philosophy; (3) for the master's degree, ethics, 
and the completion of the course of natural philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

THE MENDICANT ORDERS<p>

The University of Paris owed its origin to the union of the cathedral 
schools, which were in charge of the diocesan clergy. Soon, however, 
the two great orders, the Dominicans and the Franciscans, were founded, 
and began to revive in their monasteries the best traditions of the 
Benedictine cloister schools of former centuries. On the occasion of 
the great dispersion of 1229, when, after having had recourse to a 
<i>cessatio</i>, or suspension of lectures, the masters left the city, 
as a protest against the infringement of their privileges, the 
Dominicans obtained a license to establish a chair in the convent of 
St. James. After the return of the secular masters, in 1231, the 
Dominican master was allowed to continue his lectures. In the same year 
the Dominicans secured another chair, and the Franciscans obtained 
their first chair in the university, Alexander of Hales being installed 
as the first Franciscan master.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> In 1252 or 1253, under circumstances 
very similar to those of 1229, the great body of masters once more 
proclaimed a <i>cessatio</i>, and a struggle between the "regulars" and 
"seculars" was precipitated by the refusal of the regular professors to 
leave their chairs or to swear obedience to the statutes of the 
university. This controversy was still raging in 1257, when St. Thomas 
presented himself for his solemn <i>inceptio</i> as master in theology. 
William of St. Amour was the champion of the seculars, while St. Thomas 
and St. Bonaventure advocated the cause of the regulars.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--
324 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p324"></a>
 The outcome was that the mendicants obtained a secure standing in the 
university, and the fate of Scholasticism was practically committed to 
the teachers who belonged to the Dominican and Franciscan orders.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> In 
this way, within the Scholastic movement itself, two distinct currents 
of thought soon began to be defined, -- the Dominican tradition and 
the tradition of the Franciscan schools. The mendicant orders are thus 
associated with the greatest triumph of philosophy in the thirteenth 
century, as well as with the tendencies which, in subsequent centuries, 
led to the downfall of Scholasticism.<p>

Among the predecessors of St. Thomas in the thirteenth century were

century and the beginning of the thirteenth, to expound the physical 
and physiological doctrines of Aristotle and the Arabians. They taught 
and wrote before the introduction of the translations made from the 
Greek text of Aristotle, and were attacked by the mystics as innovators 
and teachers of profane doctrine. 
 <!--
WILLIAM OF AUVERGNE 325  
 --><A NAME="p325"></a><p>

WILLIAM OF AUVERGNE<p>

<b>Life</b>. William of Auvergne (called also William of Paris) was 
born at Aurillac towards the close of the twelfth century. About 1220 
he was appointed to teach in the episcopal school at Paris, and in a 
few years he became one of the most celebrated of the theologians of 
the university. In 1228 he became bishop of Paris. He died in 1249.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The principal works of William of Auvergne are a 
metaphysical treatise <i>De Universo</i>, and two psychological 
treatises, <i>De Anima</i> and <i>De Immortalitate Animae</i>.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> His 
collected works were published at Nuremberg in 1496, at Venice in 1591, 
and at Orleans in 1674. Monograph: <i>Die Erkenntnislehre des Wilhelm 
von Auvergne</i>, by Dr. Baumgartner (M&uuml;nster, 1893).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

William has for his aim to unite the newly introduced philosophy of 
Aristotle with the philosophy of St. Augustine and the other 
Platonists. When, however, he finds that the doctrines of the Arabian 
Aristotle clash with those of the Christian Platonists, he adopts the 
traditional Augustinian teaching.<p>

In his <i>theory of knowledge</i> he rejects, on the one hand, the 
Platonic doctrines of preexistence and of innate ideas, and on the 
other hand, the Aristotelian doctrine of the active intellect, teaching 
that, although the soul obtains a knowledge of sensible things from the 
world of sense phenomena, it is able, nevertheless, to form the 
<i>species</i> of things <i>in itself and by itself</i>; that is, 
without the aid of a power such as the active intellect, distinct from 
itself. Thus,<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> he says, "Similiter (anima) non est recipiens tantum 
sed etiam actrix et effectrix earum (i.e., specierum) <i>apud</i> semetipsam 
in semetipsa." Roger Bacon, therefore, was wrong when, after having 
listened to two lectures by William of Auvergne, he ascribed to him the 
opinion: "Intellectus Agens  
 <!--
326 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p326"></a>
 est Deus principaliter et secundarlo Angeli qui illuminant nos."<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> In 
<i>De Universo</i> William explicitly declares that the intellect 
"levissime commotus (a rebus) earum species ipse sibi ipsi semetipso 
format."<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Our knowledge of first principles is obtained, William of Auvergne 
teaches, not from the contingent world, but from God, in whom we 
perceive them by means of a "special illumination (voluntaria Dei 
illuxio").<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> In his solution of the problem of universals he seems to 
incline towards Platonic realism:<p>

<blockquote>
Necesse est res intelligibiles ita se habere sicut de eis testificatur 
intellectus. Testificatur autem eas esse communes, sempiternas, et 
seorsum a generatione et corruptione et ab omni tumultu mutationum.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

The passage is, however, capable of being interpreted in the 
Aristotelian sense.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. William of Auvergne represents the first 
stage in the transition from the Scholasticism of the twelfth to that 
of the thirteenth century. It was Alexander of Hales who, by the use of 
the Scholastic method, constructed the first of the great systems of 
Aristotelian Scholasticism.<p>

ALEXANDER OF HALES<p>

<b>Life</b>. Alexander of Hales,<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> <i>Doctor Irrefragabilis</i>, was 
born in Gloucestershire, England. In 1222 he joined the order of St. 
Francis. In 1231 he was installed as the first Franciscan teacher of 
theology in the University of Paris. He died in 1245.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The principal if not the only work of Alexander of 
Hales is the <i>Summa Theologiae</i>, which was completed by his pupils 
in 1252, and published at Nuremberg in 1482 and at Venice in 1575. 
Works to be consulted: M. Picavet, <i>Ab&eacute;lard et Alexandre de 
Hales</i> (brochure), De Martigne, <i>La Scolastique et les traditions 
Franciscaines</i> (Paris, 1888).  
 <!--
ALEXANDER OF HALES 327  
 --><A NAME="p327"></a><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Method</b>. Alexander of Hales was the first schoolman who wrote 
after the entire works of Aristotle had become known in the schools, 
and the prohibition that debarred some of his predecessors from the 
study of Aristotle had been removed. His is not the first <i>Summa</i>, 
Robert of Melun and Stephen Langton having composed <i>Summae</i> in 
the twelfth century; Alexander's is, however, the first <i>Summa</i> 
made after the introduction of Aristotle's works. In it we find the 
Scholastic method fully developed. Instead of the array of antithetical 
opinions found in Abelard's <i>Sic et Non</i> we find the tripartite 
arrangement of each question, corresponding to the arrangement 
afterwards made by St. Thomas under the heads <i>Videtur quod non, Sed 
contra</i> and <i>Respondetur ad I<sup><small>um</small></sup></i>, etc. 
Besides giving definite form to the Scholastic method, Alexander 
outlined the plan which St. Thomas and the other great summists were to 
follow.<p>

<b>Metaphysics</b>. Human reason can arrive at a knowledge of the 
existence of God, but not at a knowledge of His essence: we can know 
<i>quia est</i>, but not <i>quid est</i>.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> Alexander admits the 
validity of St. Anselm's ontological argument,<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> maintaining that a 
knowledge of God is natural to man: "Cognitio de Deo in habitu 
naturaliter nobis impressa est." He distinguishes, however, between 
<i>cognitio actualis</i> and <i>cognitio potentialis</i>.<p>

God is <i>actus purus</i>. Everything else (all created being), is 
composed of matter and form. Even spiritual substances are composed of 
spiritual matter, "quae nec est subjecta motui nec contrarietati." This 
universal matter is different from the universal matter which, 
according to Avicebrol, is the substratum of all finite existence, for 
Alexander rejects the pantheistic and Neo-Platonic elements of 
Avicebrol's philosophy.<p>

With regard to universals, Alexander teaches, in the first place, that 
they exist <i>ante rem</i> in the mind of God. The Divine 
 <!--
328 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p328"></a>
 Mind is, he thinks, the intelligible world of which Plato speaks: 
"Mundum intelligibilem nuncupavit Plato ipsam rationem sempiternam qua 
fecit Deus mundum."<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> In the next place, he teaches that the universals 
are <i>in re</i>; this may be inferred from his doctrine that the active 
intellect abstracts the intelligible species from phantasms.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Psychology</b>. Alexander's psychology, while it is Peripatetic in 
its general trend, bears evidence of the influence of the Augustinian 
idea of the soul and its faculties. In the <i>Summa</i>,<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> our 
philosopher examines seven different definitions of the soul, and 
decides that the soul, although it is the substantial form of the body, 
is itself composed of a spiritual matter -- an admission which, as the 
later schoolmen conclusively show, is incompatible with the substantial 
unity of man. In his enumeration of the faculties of the soul, he 
follows the traditional Augustinian division of the powers of the mind 
into <i>ratio</i>, which has for object the external world, 
<i>intellectus</i>, which has for object created spiritual substances, 
and <i>intelligentia</i>, which has for object the <i>rationes 
aeternae</i> and first principles. Our knowledge of the supersensible 
world by means of <i>intellect</i> and <i>intelligence</i> is dependent 
on a special divine illumination.<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> Our knowledge of the external 
world is rendered possible by the <i>active intellect</i>, which 
abstracts intelligible species from the <i>material intellect 
(phantasia)</i>. The <i>possible intellect</i>, the receptacle of these 
species, is the cognitive power of the mind considered as in potency to 
knowledge.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Alexander's philosophy exhibits, in a less 
degree than did the philosophy of William of Auvergne, the strife of 
two elements, -- the Augustinian and the Peripatetic. The Irrefragable 
Doctor made more extensive use of the writings of Aristotle than his 
predecessor had done; still he did not succeed in substituting the 
Aristotelian doctrines of metaphysics  
 <!--
ST. BONAVENTURE 329 
 --><A NAME="p329"></a>
 and psychology for the Augustinian doctrines which had become 
traditional in the schools. Alexander's most important contribution to 
philosophy is his development of the Scholastic method and his 
application of it to the discussion of theological problems. To him is 
also due the credit of outlining the plan followed in all the great 
<i>Summae</i>, and, although his synthesis of philosophical doctrine is 
lacking in unity and completeness, it cannot be denied that his 
influence on the summists of the next generation was very great. He was 
held in high esteem by Albert and St. Thomas; as Gerson says, 
"Testantur scripta ejusdem Sancti Thomae . . . quam intimum sibi 
fecerat et familiarem ilium quem laudabat doctorem Alexandrum."<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>John de la Rochelle</b> (1200-1245) was a disciple of Alexander, 
under whom he qualified for his license as teacher at Paris. He wrote a 
treatise, <i>De Anima</i>, in which he defends the Augustinian doctrine 
of the identity of the soul with its faculties (about which Alexander 
seems to hesitate), and accentuates the physiological aspect of 
psychological problems. In the latter point he shows the influence of 
the Arabian physicists. When, in 1245, he retired from the duties of 
teacher,<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> he was succeeded by John of Parma, who, in turn, was 
succeeded by St. Bonaventure.<p>

ST. BONAVENTURE<p>

<b>Life</b>. St. Bonaventure (John Fidanza), surnamed <i>Doctor 
Seraphicus</i>, was the most illustrious among the disciples of 
Alexander of Hales. He was born at Bagnorea near Viterbo, in the year 
221. In 1238<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup> he entered  
 <!--
330 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p330"></a>
 the order of St. Francis. He was sent to Paris, where, as he himself 
tells us,<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> he had for master Alexander of Hales. In 1248 he received 
his licentiate; and although in 1253 he undertook the duties of teacher 
of theology in the Franciscan convent, it was not until 1257 that he 
made his solemn <i>inceptio</i>, having for fellow-candidate St. Thomas 
of Aquin.<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> The two saints were employed by their respective orders to 
defend the mendicants against William of St. Amour, and from the moment 
of their first acquaintance at Paris until their death, which occurred 
in the same year, 1274, they maintained a friendship in which they 
seemed to rise above the spirit of rivalry existing even at that time 
between the two great orders. St. Bonaventure was made general of the 
Franciscans in 1257, and was raised to the dignity of cardinal by 
Gregory X. He died during the Council of Lyons (1274).<p>

<b>Sources</b>. St. Bonaventure's works were published in Rome
 (1586-1596), Mainz (1609), and Lyons (1668). They have been 
republished by the Franciscans of Quaracchi (near Florence). The last 
volume of this excellent edition appeared in 1902. The most important 
of St. Bonaventure's works are his <i>Commentaria in IV Libros 
Sententiarum, De Reductione Artium ad Theologiam, Itinerarium Mentis ad 
Deum, Breviloquium</i>, and a number of treatises on ascetic theology, 
such as the <i>Soliloquium, De Regimine Animes</i>, etc. As secondary 
sources we have <i>Della Vera filosofia, etc., del Serafico Dottor S. 
Bonaventura</i> by P. Marcellino da Civezza (Genova, 1874), and <i>Die 
Lehre des heil. Bonaventura, etc.</i>, by Krause (Paderborn, 1888).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

St. Bonaventure's philosophy is, like that of his two predecessors in 
the Franciscan chair of theology, a combination of Augustinian with 
Peripatetic elements. Instead, however, of drawing from the psychology
of St. Augustine, the Seraphic
 <!--
ST. BONAYENTURE 331 
 --><A NAME="p331"></a>
 Doctor draws rather from the mysticism of the Christian Plato, at the 
same time retaining in his account of the relation of form to matter 
some of the anti-Aristotelian tenets which had even in his day become 
part of the traditional teaching of the Franciscans. He is careful, 
like his great contemporary St. Thomas, to distinguish between 
theology, which has for object supernatural truth, and philosophy, 
which has for object truth of the natural order. He is inclined, 
however, to attach more importance than St. Thomas does to the 
emotional and volitional element in philosophy and to the affective, or 
the ascetico-mystic, aspect of theology. Still, it is possible to set 
aside for a moment the mystic and emotional elements of his system of 
thought, so as to enumerate the points of teaching in which he differs 
from St. Thomas and to treat under separate titles his mysticism and 
his alleged ontologism.<p>

<b>Metaphysics</b>. All finite being is composed of act and potency. 
St. Bonaventure, identifying form with act, and matter with potency, 
teaches the doctrine advocated by Alexander of Hales, -- that there is 
no form without matter.<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup> This is one of the distinctively Franciscan 
doctrines. The plurality of forms is another. Besides the substantial 
form, which completes the being of a substance, there are subordinate 
forms, which are principles of ulterior perfection.<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup> With regard to 
the principle of individuation, -- that by which the individuals of the 
same species are differentiated from one another, -- St. Bonaventure 
decides that the individual, <i>hoc aliquid</i>, is individualized both 
by the matter and by the form:<p>

<blockquote> 
Si tamen quaeras a quo veniat (individuatio) <i>principaliter</i>; 
dicendum quod individuum est hoc aliquid. Quod sit hoc, principalius 
habet a materia. Quod sit allquid, habet a forma. Individuatio igitur 
in creaturis consurgit ex duplici principio.<sup><small><a name="n35"><a href="#n_35">{35}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote> 
 <!--
332 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p332"></a>
 The doctrine of <i>rationes seminales</i> is another characteristic
doctrine of the Franciscan school. St. Thomas accounts for the 
production of created substances by postulating the potency of the 
matter acted upon and the causality, or efficiency, of the agent which 
acts. Besides these, St. Bonaventure postulates on the part of the 
matter, principles created with the matter and cooperating with the 
agent in the production of the effect. Such principles he identifies 
with the <i>rationes seminales</i> of which St. Augustine speaks.<sup><small><a name="n36"><a href="#n_36">{36}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Psychology</b>. In his psychology, St. Bonaventure enumerates 
<i>memory, intelligence</i>, and <i>will</i> as faculties of the soul, 
and distinguishes them from the essence of the soul: "Quoniam 
egrediuntur ab anima, non sunt omnino idem per essentiam."<sup><small><a name="n39"><a href="#n_39">{39}</a></a></small></sup> His 
theory of knowledge is best studied in connection with his mystical 
teachings.<p>

<b>Mysticism</b>. The mystical elements of St. Bonaventure's system of 
thought are developed in his <i>Itinerarium Mentis ad Deum</i> and his 
<i>De Reductione Artium ad Theologiam</i>. He quotes with approval the 
teachings of St. Bernard and of the Victorines, and in later times he 
himself became the favorite author of the orthodox mystics. All 
knowledge, he teaches, takes place by means of <i>illumination</i>. Now 
there are four kinds of illumination:<p>

<blockquote>
(1) lumen exterius, scilicet lumen artis mechanicae; (2) lumen 
inferius, scilicet lumen cognitionis sensitivae; (3) lumen interius, 
scilicet lumen cognitionis philosophiae, et (4) lumen superius, 
scilicet lumen gratiae et Sacrae Scripturae.<sup><small><a name="n38"><a href="#n_38">{38}</a></a></small></sup> 
</blockquote><p>

The <i>lumen interius</i>, the light of philosophical knowledge, 
starting from a knowledge of the sensible world, and of first 
principles, which are natural gifts, enables us to rise to a knowledge 
of God; but it is only by the <i>lumen superius</i>, the light of 
Divine Grace 
 <!--
ST. BONAVENTURE 333 
 --><A NAME="p333"></a>
 and Holy Writ, that we can arrive at a knowledge of <\>salutary 
truth</i>, that is, of the truth which is unto salvation. In the 
<i>Breviloquium</i>,<sup><small><a name="n39"><a href="#n_39">{39}</a></a></small></sup> St. Bonaventure adopts the teaching of Hugh of 
St. Victor, who distinguished the <i>eye of the flesh</i>, by which we 
perceive the external world, the <i>eye of reason</i>, by which we 
attain a knowledge of ourselves, and the <i>eye of contemplation</i>, 
by which we rise to a knowledge of things above us. In the external 
world we find a trace (<i>vestigium</i>) of God; in ourselves, and 
especially in the threefold activity of the soul (memory, reason, and 
will), we find an image (<i>imago</i>) of God. By means of 
contemplation of higher things we rise to a knowledge of God in His 
nature and threefold personality. Or rather, we are lifted up to this 
ecstatic knowledge; for, while it is possible without the aid of Divine 
Grace to know God as He is shadowed forth in nature and imaged in our 
own souls, it is impossible without the aid of Divine Grace to acquire 
any knowledge which is unto salvation, or to rise from the 
contemplation of higher things to a knowledge of the divine nature and 
the divine personalities.<sup><small><a name="n40"><a href="#n_40">{40}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<blockquote> 
Ad contemplationem nemo venit nisi per meditationem perspicuam, 
conversationem sanctam et orationem devotam.<sup><small><a name="n41"><a href="#n_41">{41}</a></a></small></sup><br><br> Quam 
illuminationem nemo novit nisi qui probat, nemo autem probat nisi per 
gratiam divinitus datam.<sup><small><a name="n42"><a href="#n_42">{42}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

In the highest grade of contemplative knowledge the soul is united with 
God in mental and mystic ecstasy (<i>excessus mentalis a mysticus</i>), 
which is described in the last chapter of the <i>Itinerarium</i> as a 
state in which the soul leaves all sense and intellect, and is lost, as 
it were, in God:<p>

<blockquote> 
Si autem quaeras quomodo haec fiant, interroga gratiam, non doctrinam; 
desiderium, non intellectum; gemitum orationis, non studium lectionis; 
sponsum, non magistrum; Deum, non hominem; caliginem, non claritatem; 
non lucem, sed ignem inflammantem et in Deum . . . transferentem."<sup><small><a name="n43"><a href="#n_43">{43}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote> 
 <!--
334 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p334"></a><p>

<b>Is St. Bonaventure an Ontologist?</b> Ontologism maintains (1) that 
God, the first in order of being, is the first in order of knowledge 
(<i>primum ontologicum est primum logicum</i>); (2) that, consequently, 
our knowledge of God is intuitive, not abstractive; (3) that in the 
light of the idea of God all our other ideas are acquired. Now, on the 
one hand, St. Bonaventure teaches that we rise from a knowledge of 
creatures to a knowledge of God: "Deus, qui est artifex et causa 
creaturae, per ipsam cognoscitur."<sup><small><a name="n44"><a href="#n_44">{44}</a></a></small></sup> "Cognoscere autem Deum per 
creaturas . . . hoc est proprie viatorum."<sup><small><a name="n45"><a href="#n_45">{45}</a></a></small></sup> Thus, it is evident that 
St. Bonaventure does not maintain the priority of our knowledge of God 
with reference to our knowledge of created things, nor does he maintain 
that our knowledge of God is intuitive. Moreover, his theory of 
cognition does not agree with the doctrine that we see all things in 
God; for, while he maintains that some <i>species intelligibiles</i> 
are infused, he maintains at the same time that other species are 
acquired by the abstractive power of the active intellect, and that the 
mind was at the beginning, a <i>tabula rasa</i>. "Haec autem sensibilia 
exteriora sunt quae primo ingrediuntur in animam per portas quinque 
sensuum."<sup><small><a name="n46"><a href="#n_46">{46}</a></a></small></sup> On the other hand, many of the teachings of St. 
Bonaventure are capable of an Ontologistic interpretation. He teaches, 
for example, that our knowledge of God and of the soul is independent 
of all sense-knowledge: "Necessario enim oportet ponere quod anima 
novit Deum et seipsam et quae sunt in seipsa sine adminiculo sensuum 
exteriorum."<sup><small><a name="n47"><a href="#n_47">{47}</a></a></small></sup> He also teaches that the first object of our knowledge 
is God: "Esse igitur quod primo cadit in intellectu et illud esse est 
quod est actus purus: restat igitur, quod illud esse est esse 
divinum."<sup><small><a name="n48"><a href="#n_48">{48}</a></a></small></sup> The context, however, shows that these two passages do not 
prove St. Bonaventure to be an Ontologist. He himself explains that the 
doctrine contained in the first passage agrees with the  
 <!--
ROGER BACON 335 
 --><A NAME="p335"></a>
 Aristotelian principle, "Nihil est in intellectu quod prius non fuerit 
in sensu," and he gives the key to the second passage when he 
explains<sup><small><a name="n49"><a href="#n_49">{49}</a></a></small></sup> the difference between the <i>intellectus apprehendens</i>, 
which may understand the effect without understanding the cause, and 
the <i>intellectus resolvens</i>, which, if it fully "resolves" the effect, 
must include in a knowledge of the effect a knowledge of the cause, and 
in the knowledge of any creature the knowledge of God. Besides, when, 
in a treatise which is professedly mystic, the Seraphic Doctor speaks 
of God as the first object of knowledge, he may be understood to mean 
that a knowledge of God is the beginning of that knowledge which is 
unto salvation.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. St. Bonaventure is the type of the orthodox 
mystic. He reproduces the principles of the Victorine school without 
any of the exaggerations which characterized the later representatives 
of that school. He does not oppose the study of philosophy or the use 
of dialectic. To the <i>Amo ut intelligam</i> of the mystics he adds 
the <i>Intelligo ut credam</i> and the <i>Credo ut intelligam</i> of 
the dialecticians. He became, as has been said, the favorite author of 
the mystics of later times. Gerson, for instance, writes:<p>

<blockquote>
Si quaeratur a me quis inter caeteros doctores plus videatur idoneus, 
respondeo sine praejudicio quod Dominus Bonaventura, quoniam in docendo 
solidus est, et securus, pius, justus, et devotus.<sup><small><a name="n50"><a href="#n_50">{50}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

ROGER BACON<p>

<b>Life</b>. Roger Bacon, <i>Doctor Mirabilis</i>, although belonging 
to the Franciscan order, is not a representative of Franciscan 
tradition. Still, he reproduces some of the Franciscan doctrines, and 
for this reason he may be associated with Alexander of Hales and St. 
Bonaventure. He was born near Ilchester in Gloucestershire, in the year 
1214. He studied at Oxford, where be had for masters Edmund Rich, 
Robert Greathead, and Richard  
 <!--
336 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p336"></a>
 Fitzacre (or Fishacre), from whom he imbibed a love for linguistic, 
mathematical, and physical sciences. About the year 1245 he repaired to 
Paris, <i>more suae gentis</i>, as Brucker says, there to complete his 
studies. He listened, not very respectfully, as his writings show, to 
Alexander of Hales and, possibly, to Albert the Great. Returning to 
Oxford, he joined the Franciscan order and became one of the most 
famous masters at that university. His career, however, was as brief as 
it was brilliant. He was exiled by the authority of his superiors -- 
for what reason we are not told -- and lived from 1257 to 1267 in what 
was virtually a prison belonging to his order in Paris. In 1267 he was 
liberated by order of Clement IV, and returned to Oxford. In 1278 he 
was again imprisoned on the charge of insubordination and on account of 
his violent attacks on the religious orders and the higher clergy. He 
was liberated in 1292; but so little notice did the master once so 
famous now attract that not even the date of his death is recorded.<sup><small><a name="n51"><a href="#n_51">{51}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Sources</b>. Bacon's principal works are <i>Opus Majus, Opus 
Minus</i> (an epitome of the <i>Opus Majus</i>), and <i>Opus 
Tertium</i>. Besides these he left a <i>Compendium Philosophiae</i>. 
The <i>Opus Majus</i> was published by Jebb in 1733, and by Bridges 
(Oxford), 1897. In 1859 Brewer published the remaining works of Bacon 
(London, 1859).<sup><small><a name="n52"><a href="#n_52">{52}</a></a></small></sup> An excellent study of the life of Bacon is found in 
the work of M. Charles, <i>Roger Bacon</i> (Paris, 1861). Consult also 
article by Narbey in <i>Revue des questions historiques</i> (January, 
1894) and Potthast, <i>Wegweiser</i>, p. 130.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Reform of Scientific Method</b>. Roger Bacon is rightly regarded as 
the precursor of his namesake, Francis Bacon; for he was the first to 
attempt to reform science by advocating the use of observation and 
experiment. He advocated also the study of mathematics and of 
languages. But although his efforts were supported by papal authority 
as long as Clement IV lived,  
 <!--
ROGER BACON 337 
 --><A NAME="p337"></a>
 Bacon never attained even a momentary success. The age was not yet 
tired of metaphysical speculation, and, besides, the intemperate zeal 
which Roger Bacon expended on the cause of scientific reform was of 
itself sufficient to bring about the failure of his efforts. He rightly 
insisted on the use of observation in the investigation of nature; he 
was, however, not only wrong, but imprudent when, without 
distinguishing between science and science, he condemned all use of 
deductive reasoning, even going so far as to say that mathematical 
proof does not convince unless it is confirmed by experience: "Sine 
experientia nihil sufficienter sciri potest."<sup><small><a name="n53"><a href="#n_53">{53}</a></a></small></sup> Moreover, Roger was 
somewhat boastful; in his <i>Opus Majus</i>, addressed to Clement IV, 
he said that he had invented a system of universal grammar by means of 
which any one might learn Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Arabic within a few 
days (<i>infra paucissimas dies</i>).<sup><small><a name="n54"><a href="#n_54">{54}</a></a></small></sup> So enthusiastic was he for the 
study of language that in the same work he advanced the extraordinary 
opinion that all Christians should read the Scriptures in the original 
Hebrew and Greek. These exaggerations had their natural effect. Bacon 
was regarded as a fanatic; he not only failed to influence the thought 
of his age, but even placed in the way of scientific reform obstacles 
which were not removed until the end of the Scholastic era.<p>

<b>Philosophy</b>. When Roger Bacon declared that he would burn all the 
books of Aristotle if he possessed them, he is to be understood as 
speaking of the translations of Aristotle, which he justly condemned as 
inaccurate. He held Aristotle, in the greatest reverence, and next to 
Aristotle he esteemed Avicenna; indeed, he drew much of his 
philosophical and scientific doctrine from Arabian sources. He agreed 
with his Franciscan predecessors as to the plurality of forms and the 
existence of <i>rationes 
 <!--
338 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p338"></a>
 seminales</i> in matter. In his account of the active intellect, 
however, he goes over to the camp of the Arabian transcendentalists, 
and not only maintains that the active intellect is separate, but 
explicitly identifies it with God, -- a doctrine which, as we have 
seen, he falsely attributed to William of Auvergne.<p>

<blockquote>
Et sic Intellectus Agens secundum majores philosophos non est pars 
animae sed est substantia intellectiva alia et separata per essentiam 
ab intellectu possibili.<sup><small><a name="n55"><a href="#n_55">{55}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

Still, Roger was convinced that in maintaining this doctrine he was not 
departing from the doctrine of the schools; he believed that he was 
merely interpreting St. Augustine's teaching concerning the <i>rationes 
aeternae</i>.<sup><small><a name="n56"><a href="#n_56">{56}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The Arabian doctrine that human life and human action depend on the 
heavenly bodies, -- a doctrine which formed the theoretical basis of 
magic during the Middle Ages, -- is part of the philosophy of Bacon:<p>

<blockquote>
Per coelum enim alteratur corpus, et alterato corpore, excitatur anima 
nunc ad actus privatos, nunc publicos, salva tamen in omnibus arbitrii 
libertate.<sup><small><a name="n57"><a href="#n_57">{57}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

<b>Scientific Doctrines</b>. These belong to the history of the 
physical sciences rather than to the history of philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n58"><a href="#n_58">{58}</a></a></small></sup> Bacon 
seems to have had some knowledge of the reflection and refraction of 
light, and in more than one passage of his <i>Opus Majus</i> he implies 
that he was acquainted with the use of the telescope: "Possumus sic 
figurare perspicua (ut) faceremus solem et lunam et stellas descendere 
secundum apparentiam hic inferius."<sup><small><a name="n59"><a href="#n_59">{59}</a></a></small></sup> Figuier<sup><small><a name="n60"><a href="#n_60">{60}</a></a></small></sup> thinks it probable that 
our philosopher used a combination of a concave mirror and a lens, and 
that by means of this 
 <!--
ALBERT THE GREAT 339 
 --><A NAME="p339"></a>
 combination he observed the heavenly bodies. In a work entitled <i>De 
Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturae</i>, which is ascribed to Bacon by 
Figuier and others,<sup><small><a name="n61"><a href="#n_61">{61}</a></a></small></sup> we find interesting anticipations of modern 
inventions, such as locomotives (<i>currus etiam possunt fieri ut sine 
animali moveantur cum impetu inaestimabili</i>), flying machines 
(<i>instrumenta volandi</i>), and suspension bridges (<i>sine columna 
vel aliquo sustentaculo</i>). In the Opus Majus (p. 318) the Milky Way 
is described as composed of many stars, "habens multas stellas 
congregatas."<sup><small><a name="n62"><a href="#n_62">{62}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Roger Bacon resembled Abelard in his 
complete lack of respect for authority and scientific prestige. He 
spoke disparagingly of the Irrefragable Doctor (Alexander of Hales), 
saying that his <i>Summa</i> was "plus quam pondus unius equi"; he 
characterized the great Albert as ignorant and presumptuous, and 
expressed contempt for the linguistic attainments of St. Thomas. He 
attacked the mendicant orders, the bishops, and the papal court. In 
this way he brought discredit on the cause which he was otherwise so 
well fitted to defend. He was certainly the greatest scientific light 
of the thirteenth century. Had he possessed as much prudence as 
scientific insight, he would probably have succeeded in his reforms and 
conferred inestimable benefit on Scholastic philosophy. Albert, who was 
less of an innovator than Bacon, contributed far more than Bacon did to 
the advancement of science in the thirteenth century.<p>

ALBERT THE GREAT<p>

<b>Life</b>. Blessed Albert the Great, <i>Doctor Universalis</i>, 
represents the beginning of the Dominican tradition in philosophy. He 
was of the noble family of Bollst&auml;dt, and was born at Lauingen in 
Suabia in 1193. About the year 1212 he went to Padua, where for ten 
years he devoted himself to the study of the liberal arts, including 
philosophy. In 1223 he entered the order of St. Dominic. After 
completing his theological studies at Bologna,  
 <!--
340 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p340"></a>
 he taught first at Cologne and other German cities, and later at 
Paris, where he seems to have eclipsed all his contemporaries. He 
taught at the convent of St. James, from which, after three years
 (1245-1248), he was transferred to Cologne, and it was to Cologne that 
he returned once more when, after three years (1260-1262) spent in 
Ratisbon as bishop of that see, he resigned the mitre to devote himself 
exclusively to study. He died in 1280, leaving a reputation for 
extraordinary learning and almost superhuman knowledge of the secrets 
of natural science. "Vir in omni scientia adeo divinus," says a 
contemporary, "ut nostri temporis stupor et miraculum congrue vocari 
possit."<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Albert's works, comprising twenty-one folio volumes in 
the Lyons edition of 1651 (reprinted, Paris, 1890 ff.), contain: (1) 
commentaries on Aristotle's logical, physical, metaphysical, and 
ethical treatises; in these the text and the exposition of the text are 
not separated, as they are in St. Thomas' commentaries; (2) 
philosophical works -- <i>De Causis et Processu Universitatis</i> and 
<i>De Unitate Intellectus contra Averroem</i>; (3) theological works
 -- commentaries on Scripture, commentaries on the Sentences, <i>Summa 
de Creaturis, Summa Theologica</i>, and ascetic treatises, such as the 
<i>Paradisus Animes</i>. Monograph: Sighart's <i>Albert der Grosse</i>, 
trans. in abridged form by Dixon (London, 1876).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

The philosophy of Albert the Great is mainly identical in spirit and 
content with that of his illustrious disciple, St. Thomas. There are, 
however, some points of difference; as, for example, in the doctrine of 
the existence of <i>rationes seminales</i> and the permanence of the 
forms of elements in a mixture, both of which are maintained by Albert 
but rejected by St. Thomas. It may be said, without detracting from the 
credit due to Albert as one of the greatest exponents of Scholasticism 
in its final form, that it was his pupil who first imparted to 
Scholasticism its most compact systematic development.<p>

<b>Logic</b> is divided into two parts, the study of <i>incomplexa</i>, 
or uncombined elements of thought, and the study of <i>complexa</i>, 
that is, of judgment and inference.<sup><small><a name="n63"><a href="#n_63">{63}</a></a></small></sup> In the second tract of the book, 
 <!--
ALBERT THE GREAT 341 
 --><A NAME="p341"></a>
 <i>De Praedicabilibus</i>, Albert takes up the study of the problem of 
universals and answers each of Porphyry's questions according to the 
principles of moderate realism, which, since the beginning of the 
thirteenth century, had become the common doctrine of the schools.<p>

<b>Metaphysics</b>, or <i>philosophia prima</i>, treats of Being and 
its most universal properties. Under this head is included also the 
problem of the existence of God. The proof on which Albert places 
greatest reliance is not the ontological, but the cosmological 
argument.<sup><small><a name="n64"><a href="#n_64">{64}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Cosmology</b>. Albert teaches that God created the world <i>ex 
nihilo</i>, according to exemplars (<i>species et rationes omnium 
creatorum</i>) existing eternally in the Divine Mind.<sup><small><a name="n65"><a href="#n_65">{65}</a></a></small></sup> The world is 
not the best possible world.<sup><small><a name="n66"><a href="#n_66">{66}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Psychology</b>. The soul is an immaterial principle, the form of the 
body: "Ex anima et corpore fit unum naturaliter et 
substantialiter."<sup><small><a name="n67"><a href="#n_67">{67}</a></a></small></sup> The intellect is a faculty of the soul, 
independent indeed of the body (<i>non affixa organo</i>), yet 
receiving from the organism the material of thought. It is not the 
intellect that is fatigued, but the organism (<i>motus phantasmatum et 
discursus spiritus</i>) which ministers to it.<sup><small><a name="n68"><a href="#n_68">{68}</a></a></small></sup> Albert composed a 
treatise in refutation of the Arabian doctrine that the intellect is 
one for all men.<p> 

<b>Scientific Doctrines</b>. It was as a student of nature that Albert 
showed the universality of his genius. He was an authority, in his day, 
on physics, geography, astronomy, mineralogy, botany, alchemy, zoblogy, 
physiology, and phrenology. His contributions to natural science are 
quite as important as his contributions to philosophy. Indeed, his 
chief merit as a philosopher lies in the fact that he did more than any 
of his predecessors to establish in philosophy the spirit of scientific 
investigation. It 
 <!--
342 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p342"></a>
 is true that he borrowed many of his scientific doctrines from 
Aristotle; nevertheless, he did not hesitate to criticise Aristotle and 
to reprove those who regarded Aristotle as infallible: "Si autem credit 
ipsum (Aristotelem) esse hominem, tunc procul dubio errare potuit sicut 
et nos."<sup><small><a name="n69"><a href="#n_69">{69}</a></a></small></sup> He borrowed also from the Arabian and Jewish commentators of 
Aristotle, but he hints that personal observation led him to hold 
various physical doctrines which he did not feel justified in 
mentioning in his commentaries:<p>

<blockquote>
Physica enim tantum suscepimus dicenda plus secundum peripateticorum 
sententiam prosequentes ea quae intendimus quam ex nostra scientia.<sup><small><a name="n70"><a href="#n_70">{70}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

"Dicta peripateticorum, prout melius potui, exposui," he says at the 
end of his book, <i>De Animalibus</i>, "nec aliquis in eo potest 
deprehendere quid ego ipse sent iam in philosophia naturali."<p>

Albert's original contributions to natural science cannot be mentioned 
here except in a general way. He was the first to use the term affinity 
to designate the cause of the combination of elements. He rejected the 
current theory that baser metals may be changed into gold by means of 
the philosopher's stone.<sup><small><a name="n71"><a href="#n_71">{71}</a></a></small></sup> Still, he maintained the possibility of 
transmuting one metal into another; for all metals are naturally 
produced by the earth from a combination of sulphur and mercury 
(<i>argentum vivum</i>); they differ, therefore, by an accidental, not 
by a substantial form.<sup><small><a name="n72"><a href="#n_72">{72}</a></a></small></sup> Albert's observations and experiments in 
botany, zoology, and physical geography are mentioned in terms of the 
highest praise by Humboldt.<sup><small><a name="n73"><a href="#n_73">{73}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Albert is, without doubt, the greatest of 
the Christian expounders of Aristotle who appeared before the time of 
St. Thomas. We have seen that he is not a slavish follower of 
Aristotle; he takes cognizance of the work done by  
 <!--
ST. THOMAS OF AQUIN 343
 --><A NAME="p343"></a>
 the Jews and Arabians, he acknowledges the debt that Christian 
philosophy owes to Plato and the Platonists, and in the region of 
physical science he advances by the exercise of personal observation 
beyond the doctrine of Platonists and Peripatetics. Great, however, as 
was Albert's erudition, -- for he seems to have been exceptionally 
well read in the literature of physical science, -- his knowledge of 
the succession of systems of thought was singularly inaccurate: he 
speaks, for example, of Plato as deriving certain doctrines from the 
Epicureans.<sup><small><a name="n74"><a href="#n_74">{74}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Albert's chief merit lies in the success with which he expounded 
Aristotle's physical doctrines, and in the impulse which his own 
researches in physical science gave to the investigation of nature. He 
was lacking in the power of synthesizing the scattered elements of 
knowledge into a compact system of thought. In this respect he was 
excelled by his illustrious pupil, St. Thomas, whose future glory he 
foretold, and whose renown as a teacher outshone his own, throwing 
greater luster on the Church and on the order of St. Dominic, to which 
both Albert and St. Thomas belonged.<p>

settled practically every point in favor of the regulars. Meantime, the 
controversy was extended beyond the question of university privilege, 
and touched on the rights of religious in general, the vow of poverty, 
etc. After the death of Alexander IV, the university obtained a 
confirmation of its privileges, and the mendicants quietly submitted to 
take the oath to which they had formerly objected.<p>

before 1257. Denifle (<i>Chartul.</i>, I, p. 333, note 6) maintains 
that St. Bonaventure was elected general in 1257, that (<i>ibid.</i>, 
187, note 5) he was appointed to teach in 1248, and that (<i>ibid.</i>, 
244, note 5) he may have been magister regens in 1253. It is probable
