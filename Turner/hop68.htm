602 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p602"></a>
<h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXVIII<br>
FRENCH PHILOSOPHY</h3><p>

At the end of the eighteenth century the sensism of Condillac was the 
dominant philosophy in France. During the Revolution this sensism was 
represented by the materialist Cabanis, of whom mention has already 
been made. During the last years of the eighteenth century and the 
first years of the nineteenth <b>Destutt de Tracy</b> (1754-1836) 
taught a system of ideological sensism in opposition to the 
physiological sensism of Cabanis.<p>

The period of reconstruction, with which the nineteenth century opened 
in France, witnessed <i>two important movements opposed to sensism</i>, 
the one theological and the other psychological. Towards the middle of 
the century, positivism appeared, and, as a result of the practical 
bent of positivism, there appeared also an important school of economy 
and sociology. Accordingly, the history of French philosophy in the 
nineteenth century includes the study of (1) <i>the theological or 
traditionalist school</i>, (2) <i>the psychologico-spiritualistic 
school</i>, (3) <i>positivism</i>, and (4) <i>the sociological 
school</i>.<p>

1. <b>The Traditionalist School</b>.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> The Catholic reaction against 
the materialism and rationalism of the period of enlightenment, so 
called, appears in the writings of <b>Joseph de Maistre</b>
 (1754-1821), who in his work, <i>Du Pape</i> (1819-1820), defends the 
principle of papal authority, and in his <i>Soir&eacute;es de Saint 
Petersbourg</i> (1821) arraigns the philosophy of the eighteenth 
century as a conspiracy against the truth. In the latter work De 
Maistre touches on the relation of Divine Providence to human affairs, 
and speaks of a future religious renovation which he describes in 
somewhat mystical language as the submerging of all things and all men 
in the ocean of divinity.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
THE TRADITIONALISTS 603 
 --><A NAME="p603"></a><p>

DE BONALD<p>

<b>Life</b>. Louis Gabriel de Bonald, who is perhaps the most important 
of the <i>traditionalists</i> of this period, was born at Mouna near 
Millau, in 1754. Having thrown in his lot with the royalists, he was 
obliged in 1791 to leave France. He sought refuge at Heidelberg, where 
he composed his treatise entitled <i>Th&eacute;orie du pouvoir 
politique et religieux</i> (Constance, 1796). After his return from 
exile he was appointed by Napoleon to the position of councilor of the 
University of Paris, and subsequently held several political offices 
under Louis XVIII and Charles X. In 1830 he renounced the peerage, to 
which he had been raised by Louis XVIII, and returned to his native 
place, where he died in 1840. His collected works were published in 
twelve volumes (Paris, 1817-1819).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

De Bonald's philosophy is based on his <i>theory of language</i>. 
Language, he teaches, is not an invention of man; for in order to 
invent it, man should think, and he cannot think without words: <i>"Il 
faut penser sa parole avant de parler sa pens&eacute;e."</i> Language, 
therefore, was <i>given</i> to man by God himself; and as language 
implies a knowledge of the essential truths of the religious, 
metaphysical, moral, and political orders, such truths must have been 
conveyed to primitive man together with language. Since the history of 
philosophy shows that human reason is of itself incapable of arriving 
at a knowledge of these truths, philosophical method demands that the 
<i>divine revelation</i> and <i>tradition</i> on which our knowledge of 
such truths depends should be set up as the supreme criterion of truth. 
This account of the origin of language implies that social organization 
of some sort existed from the beginning, and that political authority 
had not its origin in a social contract. Developing the principles of 
his speculative system and applying them to the study of the social 
life of man, De Bonald teaches that the family is the social unit; that 
the state is not a union of individuals but of families; that in every 
political society there are three moral 
 <!--
604 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p604"></a>
 personalities, represented by the words <i>power, minister</i>, and 
<i>subject</i>; that in every state there should exist between these 
personalities union and distinction; and that such union and 
distinction are best maintained in a monarchy in which both the 
authority of the ruler and that of the ministers are hereditary.<p>

LAMENNAIS<p>

<b>Life</b>. F&eacute;licit&eacute; Robert de Lamennais, who was by far 
the ablest of the traditionalists, was born at St. Malo in 1782. He was 
educated by his uncle and by his brother, Jean-Marie, who was a priest 
and founder of a religious society. At the age of twenty-two he 
experienced the religious crisis of his life. From this time forward he 
set aside all the doubts which had troubled his youth, spent for the 
most part in desultory reading, and gave himself up to study and prayer 
at La Ch&ecirc;naie, the villa which Maurice de Gu&eacute;rin has so 
vividly described. After a brief sojourn in England, Lamennais returned 
to France, and in 1816 was ordained priest. During the years 1818-1830, 
besides publishing the <i>Essai sur l'indiff&eacute;rence en 
mafi&egrave;re de religion</i>, he contributed to the 
<i>Conservateur</i> and to other monarchical periodicals articles in 
which he attacked the Revolution and defended the rights of the Church. 
So great was the favor which these articles found at Rome that Leo XII 
proposed to elevate Lamennais to the dignity of cardinal. From the 
publication of <i>l'Avenir</i>, which first appeared in 1830, dates a 
new era in Lamennais' life. The motto of the group of distinguished 
contributors to this celebrated journal was <i>Dieu el la 
libert&eacute;</i> as <i>Dieu et le roi</i> was that of the royalists. 
They defended freedom of conscience, freedom of education, and freedom 
of the press; they advocated the separation of Church and State, and 
the rescinding of the Concordat; they proclaimed the coming triumph of 
democracy and the abolition of hereditary monarchy. These views 
naturally provoked opposition. In 1831 the three principal writers 
engaged on the paper, Lamennais, Lacordaire, and Montalembert, went to 
lay their case before the Holy See. In the following year Gregory XVI 
issued the encyclical <i>Mirari Vos</i>, condemning the doctrines 
advocated in the columns of <i>l'Avenir</i>. Lamennais submitted at 
first, but later, as is well known, recalled his adhesion to the papal 
decision, and, in the <i>Paroles d'un croyant</i> (1834) and in the 
<i>Affaires de Rome</i>, made open war on the Church and on the whole 
existing order. In 1841 appeared the <i>Esquisse d'une philosophie</i> 
in four volumes, Lamennais' greatest constructive work. In 1834 he 
 <!--
THE TRADITIONALISTS 605 
 --><A NAME="p605"></a>
 threw in his lot with the revolutionary party, and in 1841 was elected 
to the Chamber of Deputies. He died unreconciled to the Church in 1854.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. During Lamennais' lifetime his works were collected and 
published in twelve volumes (Paris, 1836-1837). Subsequently, several 
treatises not contained in this edition were published. For full 
bibliography compare Molien et Duine, <i>Lamennais, sa vie, ses 
id&eacute;es</i> (Lyons, 1898). Consult also Gibson's <i>The 
Abb&eacute; de Lamennais and the Liberal Catholic Movement in 
France</i> (London, 1896).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<i>Traditionalism</i>. In the <i>Essai sur l'indiff&eacute;rence</i> 
Lamennais appears as the champion of orthodox Christianity. He assails 
the fundamental tenet of rationalism and endeavors to prove the 
inability of individual human reason to arrive at a knowledge of truth. 
Having shown that <i>the individual mind is incapable of attaining 
certitude</i>, he proceeds to establish a new criterion of truth, 
namely the verdict of the collective reason, -- in other words, the 
universal consent of mankind. By means of this criterion he proves the 
truth of theism, revealed religion, and Catholicism. Lamennais' 
traditionalism appears when (as in <i>Essai</i>, Tome II, chap. xvi) he 
refers the verdict of the collective reason (raison sociale) to the 
illumination of a higher reason.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Philosophical Synthesis</b>. In the <i>Esquisse d'une 
philosophie</i> Lamennais appears as a synthetic philosopher. To the 
traditionalism which he professed in his earlier work he here adds an 
element of <i>mysticism</i>, teaching that tradition is to be 
supplemented by faith, that God is the first object of philosophy, and 
that the finite is to be known by means of the infinite. With this 
 Neo-Platonic mysticism he mingles a strange form of 
<i>rationalism</i>; he maintains, for example, the identity of the 
supernatural with the natural order of truth, and teaches that the 
Trinity is an object of philosophical speculation. Finally, he 
introduces an <i>element of pantheism</i>, teaching that while there are two 
 <!--
606 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p606"></a>
 classes of being, namely finite and infinite, there is but one 
substance, and that substance is God.<p>

Among those who are influenced to a greater or less degree by 
Lamennais' philosophical doctrines were <b>Gerbet</b> (1798-1864), 
<b>Rohrbacher</b> (1789-1856), <b>Bautain</b> (1795-1867), 
<b>Bonnetty</b> (1798-1879), <b>Ventura</b> (1792-1861), and 
<b>Gratry</b> (1805-1872). Of these, Bautain, Bonnetty, and Ventura 
developed traditionalism into a system of fideism, substituting for the 
universal consent of mankind faith in God and in the doctrines of the 
Scriptures and of the Church, while Gratry in his celebrated work, 
<i>De la connaissance de Dieu</i>, developed a system of ontologism.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The traditionalists, fideists, and 
ontologists of this period were all actuated by the same motive, -- the 
desire to offset the materialistic scepticism of the age of 
enlightenment and to place theism and Christianity on a firmer basis 
than that which individual speculation can furnish. But, as Gratry 
himself pointed out, the attempt to discredit individual reason could 
not but result in the discredit of religion, so that, far from curing 
religious indifference, philosophical indifference was calculated to 
aggravate the evil. This is the sentence which the Church pronounced in 
condemnation of traditionalism.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

2. <b>The Psychologico-Spiritualistic School</b> was, like the 
traditionalist movement, an attempt <i>to counteract the influence of 
scepticism and materialism</i>. But, instead of turning to tradition 
and authority for the principles out of which it was to build a 
spiritualistic philosophy, this school turned to Cartesian psychology 
and restored psychological introspection to its place as a supreme 
criterion of philosophical truth.<p>

<b>Maine de Biran</b><sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> (1766-1824) belonged at first to the 
ideological school of De Tracy; later, however, he developed a system 
of his own, based on the importance of internal reflection as a
 <!--
THE FRENCH ECLECTICS 607 
 --><A NAME="p607"></a>
 method in philosophy. By means of this reflection we become aware of 
the <i>voluntary effort</i> which distinguishes our external from our 
internal experience. In this way we arrive at a knowledge of 
<i>self</i> as distinct from <i>not-self</i>, and at an understanding 
of the true nature of mental life and mental phenomena. For the 
abstract metaphysician the soul must remain an unknown quantity; for 
the advocate of sensism also it must remain unknown as to its true 
nature, because the sensist is unable to avoid the interpretation of 
internal phenomena in terms of external causes. The only legitimate 
method in philosophy is that of <i>internal reflection</i>.<p>

During the last years of his life De Biran abandoned the standpoint of 
psychological experience for that of mystic intuition. To the two 
stages of life, that of <i>representation</i>, which animals possess, 
and that of volition (or rather of sensation and <i>volition</i> united 
in perception), he now adds a third, that of <i>love</i>, -- the 
spiritual life in which representation and volition are absorbed in the 
life of supernatural grace.<p>

<b>Royer-Collard</b> (1763-1845), who was more distinguished as a 
statesman than as a philosopher, introduced into France the principles 
of the Scottish school, and thus prepared the way for the eclecticism 
of Cousin.<p>

<b>Victor Cousin</b> (1792-1867), borrowing from Leibniz the principle 
that "systems are true by what they affirm and false by what they 
deny," sought to unite in one <i>eclectic</i> system Platonism,
 Neo-Platonism, and German transcendentalism, using the criterion of 
the Scottish school -- common sense -- as his guiding principle. His 
works consist of lecture courses (published 1815-1820 and 1828-1830), 
and <i>Fragments philosophiques</i> (published in five volumes, 1866).<p>

Cousin, with whom the influence of German speculation was at one time 
preponderant, maintained that the <i>impersonal reason</i> has an 
immediate intuition of the Absolute. Later, however, he went back to 
the Cartesian position and restored individual 
 <!--
608 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p608"></a>
 introspection to its place in philosophical method. At a still later 
period he seems to have reduced philosophy to a matter of merely 
historical interest. He taught that all philosophical systems may be 
arranged under four heads: <i>sensism, idealism, scepticism</i>, and 
<i>mysticism</i>; that in each of these there are elements of truth; 
and that the whole truth is to be found in a syncretic union of those 
doctrines which common sense judges to be true.<p>

<b>Th&eacute;odore Jouffroy</b> (1796-1842) took the extreme 
spiritualistic view of the relation between physiology and psychology, 
treating them as branches of science which have nothing to do with each 
other. His <i>eclecticism</i> appears in the following saying: "There 
are two ways in which the thinking man can win peace for his soul and 
rest for his spirit; the one is to possess, or to believe he possesses, 
the truth respecting the questions which interest humanity; the other 
is to perceive clearly that truth is unattainable and to know why it is 
so."<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> There are, he maintains, limits to the horizon of science, and 
it is the task of science gradually to determine those limits. Here we 
observe the practical spirit which appears in more systematic form in 
positivism.<p>

3. <b>Positivism</b>.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> <b>Auguste Comte</b> (1798-1857) is the 
founder of positivism. Many influences went to form his system of 
thought, -- the sensism of Diderot, the criticism of Kant, the common 
sense of the Scottish school, the scepticism of Hume, and the mysticism 
of the Middle Ages. Comte stood in relations of personal friendship 
with Saint-Simon, John Stuart Mill, and Littr&eacute;. His principal 
work is his <i>Cours de philosophie positive</i>, published 1839-1842 
(translated by Harriet Martineau, London, 1853).  
 <!--
POSITIVISM 609  
 --><A NAME="p609"></a><p>

<i>Relativity of knowledge</i>. The critical or destructive aspect of 
positivism appears in its <i>denial of the validity of metaphysical 
speculation</i> and in its <i>abolition of final causes and of the 
absolute</i>. Our knowledge, according to positivism, is confined to 
facts and the relations of facts. We do not know the essences of 
things; all knowledge is therefore limited to our sense-knowledge of 
facts and to the higher kind of organized knowledge, which is a 
knowledge of the relations of facts. It is futile to inquire into the 
first origin or the ultimate destiny of the facts which we know: 
<i>positive</i> philosophy confines its inquiry to the investigation of 
the relations existing between facts. At the same time, positivism is 
far from giving its sanction to that empiricism which merely studies 
facts as isolated phenomena; for the knowledge of isolated phenomena is 
valueless unless it be referred to a law or theory by which facts are 
explained.<p>

<i>Law of the three stages</i>. Positive knowledge begins when we learn 
to explain phenomena by their laws. Now this stage of knowledge was 
preceded, in the development of human thought, by two preliminary 
stages, the metaphysical and the theological. The <i>law of the three 
stages</i> is as follows: human thought passed successively through the 
<i>theological</i>, the <i>metaphysical</i>, and the <i>positive</i> 
stage, which correspond to the childhood, youth, and manhood of 
science. In the theological stage of thought, every phenomenon was 
referred to the voluntary action of supernatural intelligent beings, 
and fetichism, polytheism, and monotheism became successively the 
explanation of natural events; in the metaphysical stage of thought, 
abstract occult causes took the place of the supernatural entities of 
the theological period, and events were explained by referring them to 
chemical force, vital force, substantial forms, etc.; finally, in the 
positive stage of thought, occult and abstract causes are discarded, 
and phenomena are explained by means of laws. This law of three stages 
is germinally contained in the writings of <b>Turgot</b>
 (1727-1781).<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> 
 <!--
610 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p610"></a><p>

<i>Classification of sciences</i>. Some of the sciences have already 
attained the positive stage, in which they deal merely with concrete 
facts and laws; others are still in the metaphysical or the theological 
stage. Taking the positive sciences in the order of increasing 
complexity, Comte reduces them to six, namely, <i>mathematics, 
astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology</i>, and <i>sociology</i>. This 
arrangement indicates the order in which the sciences have arrived at 
the positive stage and also the order of dependence, each science being 
dependent on those which precede it. Metaphysics finds no place in the 
classification, and psychology is included under biology.<p>

With regard to <i>sociology</i>, it is Comte's aim to make it a 
positive science, and to this project he devotes special attention. He 
starts with the doctrine that the relations of man to his fellow-men 
are subject to law, and proceeds to the discovery and formulation of 
the laws of the social order: (1) in the <i>social statics</i> (the 
inquiry into the conditions which constitute social equilibrium and 
insure the permanence of social states), and (2) in the <i>social 
dynamics</i> (the inquiry into the laws of social progress). In the 
former he lays down the principle that the harmony, solidarity, and 
mutual dependence of the different elements. in social life depend on 
the proper adjustment of the selfish and the altruistic impulses of the 
individual. The selfish impulses constitute the conservative, while the 
altruistic impulses constitute the progressive, element in science, 
art, religion, politics, and industry. In the <i>social dynamics</i> 
Comte makes use of the principle of development from <i>militarism</i> 
through the <i>juristic</i> phase to the <i>industrial</i> phase of 
human society, -- three stages which correspond to the <i>theological, 
metaphysical</i>, and <i>positive</i> stages of intellectual 
development.<p>

<i>Mysticism</i>. In his later writings Comte evinces a decided leaning 
towards the principles of mysticism. He abandons the view that 
intellectual development is paramount, and that the stage of positive 
science is the highest aim of human activity 
 <!--
THE FRENCH SOCIOLOGICAL SCHOOL 611 
 --><A NAME="p611"></a>
 and of social amelioration. In his earlier works he was content with 
expressing his admiration for "everything great and deep which the 
Catholic system effected during the Middle Ages"; now, however, he has 
recourse to the Catholic system for direct inspiration, and learns from 
the study of the <i>Imitation of Christ</i> to put the spiritual and 
emotional above the intellectual as a standard of values. He aims at 
<i>making positivism a religion</i>, of which he himself is to be the 
first pontiff. The objects of veneration in this new religion are to be 
the "great being" (<i>humanity</i>), the "great medium"
 (<i>world-space</i>), and the "great fetich" (<i>the earth</i>), which 
are to form the positivist trinity. Nature must be looked upon as 
essentially endowed with life, and all humanity is to form one family. 
There must be universal and whole-souled adhesion to the dogmas of the 
positive religion, all freedom of inquiry being rigorously prohibited, 
the only matter in which individuality is permitted being that of 
private devotion, by which each may venerate some particular person, 
living or dead, as his guardian angel.<p>

Among the most distinguished of Comte's disciples was the well-known 
lexicographer, <b>E. Littre</b> (1801-1881), who after having posed as 
the "saint of positivism" was eventually converted to the Catholic 
Church.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. It is hardly necessary to point out here 
the superficiality of the positivist doctrine of knowledge, the 
inaccuracy of Comte's historical formula (law of three stages), and the 
inadequacy of his classification of sciences. Positivism has had 
greater and more widespread influence in England than in France, where 
the defection of its founder from the principles of intellectual 
positivism did much to discredit the system.<p>

4. <b>The Sociological School</b>.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> Mention has already been made of 
<b>Saint-Simon</b> (1760-1825) among those who had a determining 
influence on the formation of Comte's idea of philosophy. Saint-Simon 
did not formulate a system of speculative thought; 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 612 
 --><A NAME="p612"></a>
 he represents, however, a tendency which may be designated as 
<i>industrialism</i>, and which took definite form and received 
systematic development in the writings of the French sociologists who 
flourished about the middle of the nineteenth century. The best known 
of the Saint-Simoniens, as they are called, are <b>Augustin Thierry</b> 
(1795-1856), <b>Pierre Leroux</b> (1797-1871), and <b>Jean Reynaud</b> 
(1806-1863). These writers favored a reorganization of the social order 
on the basis of material progress, advocating the substitution of 
<i>industrial and economic ideals</i> for intellectual and aesthetic 
ideals in political and social life. Things, they maintained, not men, 
must be exploited: the material world must be developed. Saint-Simon 
himself had the greatest respect for the social organization of the 
Middle Ages. The new era, he maintained, has so far been a period of 
social and spiritual chaos out of which a new Christianity must be 
developed, -- a Christianity which, however, will be more of a religion 
of this life than mediaeval Christianity was. This idea was taken up by 
<b>Enfantin</b> (1796-1864), who became the <i>p&egrave;re 
supr&ecirc;me</i> of the new religion, and not only preached but also 
practised the doctrines of socialism and communism in the community 
which he founded.<p>

Opposed to the socialists of the school of Saint-Simon were those 
sociologists who believed that the present social order is sound, and 
that, if free play be given to the industrial forces now existing, they 
will of themselves produce harmony and social well-being. <i>Laissez 
faire, laissez passer</i> may be said to have been the motto of this 
school, to which <b>J. B. Say</b> (1767-1832) and <b>Bastiat</b>
 (1801-1850) belonged. <b>Sismondi</b> (1773-1842), while protesting 
against the <i>laissez faire</i> doctrine, adopted a modified form of 
political optimism and advocated the intervention of the state for the 
purpose of directing the social forces towards the general 
happiness.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup><p>
