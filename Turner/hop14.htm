THE EPICUREANS</h3><p>

<b>Sources</b>. Of the voluminous writings of Epicurus only a few 
fragments have come down to us, and these are for the most part 
unimportant. For the history of the school the most important primary 
source is Lucretius' poem <i>De Rerum Natura</i>. As secondary sources 
we have the works of Cicero, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and the 
Aristotelian commentators.<p>

<i>History of the Epicurean School</i>.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> <b>Epicurus</b> was born at 
Samos in the year 341 or 342 B.C. His father, Neocles, was, Strabo 
tells us, a school teacher. According to the tradition of the Epicurean 
school, Epicurus was a self-taught philosopher, and this is confirmed 
by his very superficial acquaintance with the philosophical systems of 
his predecessors. Still, he must have had some instruction in 
philosophy, for Pamphilus and Nausiphanes are mentioned as having been 
his teachers; Epicurus, however, would not acknowledge his debt to 
them, boasting that he had begun his self-instruction at the age of 
fourteen, having been driven to rely on his own powers of thought by 
the inability of his teacher to explain what was meant by the Chaos of 
Hesiod. He first taught at Mitylene, afterwards at Lampsacus, and 
finally at Athens, where he established his school in a garden, thereby 
giving occasion for the name by which his followers were known, <b>hoi 
apo t&ocirc;n k&ecirc;p&ocirc;n</b>. Here he taught until his death, 
which took place in 270 B.C.<p>

The most celebrated of the disciples of Epicurus were <b>Metrodorus</b> 
(born 330 B.C.), <b>Hermarchus</b> (who succeeded Epicurus as president 
of the school and was succeeded by <b>Polystratus</b>), 
<b>Dionysius</b>, and <b>Basilides</b>. Towards the end of the second 
century B.C. the school was represented at Athens by <b>Apollodorus, Zeno 
of Sidon</b>, and <b>Phaedrus</b>.<p>

<b>Amalfinius</b> (about 150 B.C.) seems to have been the first to make 
known the doctrines of Epicurus to the Romans. Later on we hear of a  
 <!--
176 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p176"></a>
 <b>Syro</b>, or Sciro, who taught Epicurean philosophy at Rome; but it 
is <b>Lucretius</b> (Titus Lucretius Carus, 95-51 B.C.) who, in his 
poem <i>De Rerum Natura</i>, gives us the first Latin contribution to 
Epicurean literature.<p>

Although the school of Epicurus is said to have been distinguished by 
its cheerful tone, it is certain that it indulged in much abusive 
criticism, for the Epicureans were known throughout antiquity as 
leaders in the art of calumny. Everything, therefore, which the 
Epicureans say about the systems and the philosophers of pre-Socratic 
and Socratic times must have corroboration from other sources before it 
can be accepted. Epicurus himself set the example in misrepresentation, 
when he gave expression to his contempt for his teachers and 
predecessors, while from his own followers he exacted every outward 
mark of respect, even insisting on their committing to memory certain 
brief formulas (<b>kuriai doxai</b>) which contained the pith of his 
teaching.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Hence it is that the Epicurean philosophy adhered so 
closely to the form which it first received from the teaching of 
Epicurus.<p>

EPICUREAN PHILOSOPHY<p>

<b>Epicurean Notion of Philosophy</b>. Having defined philosophy as 
<i>the art of making life happy</i>,<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> and having laid down the 
principle that there should be no deviation from the <b>kuriai 
doxai</b>, Epicurus subordinated speculation to the practical aspects 
of philosophy and effectively discouraged all independence of thought 
on the part of his disciples. It is well known that he despised 
learning and culture. The only logical problem to which he gave even 
cursory attention was the problem of knowledge. He attached greater 
value to the study of nature, but only because he considered that a 
knowledge of natural causes may free the mind from a fear of the gods 
and in this way contribute to human happiness.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> In the philosophy of 
Epicurus, therefore, <i>ethics</i>, or the inquiry into the nature and 
conditions of happiness, is the paramount problem, to which 
<i>logic</i> and the <i>study of nature</i> are merely the 
preliminaries.<p>

<b>Epicurean Logic</b>. This portion of Epicurean philosophy was styled 
<i>canonic</i>, because it consists merely of a system of rules, 
 <!--
EPICUREAN LOGIC 177
 -->
 or canons, referring to the acquisition of knowledge and the 
ascertainment of truth. It passes by the questions of formal logic and 
is in reality an epistemology.<p>

In their <i>theory of knowledge</i> the Epicureans favor a more 
pronounced sensism than that of the Stoics. They maintain that, while 
in practice the standard of truth is pleasure and pain, in theory the 
ultimate test of all knowledge is <i>sensation</i> 
(<b>aisth&ecirc;sis</b>). Sensation as such, is always to be relied 
upon; error lies not in the sensation itself, but rather in our 
judgment concerning sensation. Several sensations amalgamated in a 
general picture result in a notion (<b>prol&ecirc;psis</b>). The 
notion, however, as regards objective value, is not superior to the 
sensations from which it arises.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> From notions arises <i>opinion</i>, 
or <i>thought</i> (<b>doxa, hupol&ecirc;psis</b>), which likewise 
depends on sensation for its truth.<p>

How, then, does sensation take place? In their answer to this question 
the Epicureans content themselves with reproducing the doctrine of 
Democritus, according to whom sensation takes place by means of certain 
<i>effluxes</i> (<b>eidola, aporroai</b>), which, detaching themselves 
from external objects and passing through the pores of the air, enter 
the senses.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> If, therefore, sensation is sometimes apparently at fault, 
the real source of the deception lies in the objective distortion or 
mutilation of the efflux-images. Thus, for example, the image of a man 
and the image of a horse, combined as it were by accident, give rise to 
the impression of a centaur.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Our impression, even in cases of this 
kind, corresponds to the image, and consequently the sensation is true. 
And if, as sometimes happens, the same object affects several persons 
differently, the cause of the diversity of impression is the plurality 
of images; the sensation in each case is true because it corresponds to 
the image which produces it.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--

<b>Epicurean Physics</b>. The physical doctrines of the Epicureans 
receive their tone and character from the purpose which the Epicureans 
always had in mind throughout their investigations of nature, -- <i>to 
free men from the fear of the gods</i>. To this aim the Epicureans 
subordinated their physical inquiries, and as they cared little whether 
their explanation was accurate or inaccurate, complete or incomplete, 
they left matters of detail to be settled by individuals according to 
individual choice, insisting, however, in their general explanation of 
natural phenomena, on the exclusion of any cause that was not a natural 
cause.<p>

Deliberately rejecting the Socratic philosophy of nature and turning to 
the pre-Socratic systems of philosophy, Epicurus recognized that the 
philosophy which was most naturalistic in its explanations and waged 
most persistent warfare on final causes, was that of Democritus. As his 
theory of nature, therefore, he adopted the physics of Democritus, 
modifying it, as we shall see, in one important respect. Thus he 
accepted without modification the <i>atomism</i> of Democritus as well 
as the Democritean idea of a <i>vacuum</i>. Nothing exists except atoms 
and void: mind as moving cause is a superfluous postulate:<p>

<blockquote>
Ergo, praeter inane et corpora, tertia per se<br> 
Nulla potest rerum in numero natura relinqui.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> 
</blockquote><p>

The only point on which Democritus and Epicurus differ is in reference 
to the <i>primal motion of atoms</i>. Democritus maintained that the 
atoms, falling through empty space, moved with different velocities on 
account of their difference in weight. This, Aristotle pointed out, is 
impossible. Epicurus, acknowledging the justice of Aristotle's 
criticism, sought to account for the collision of the falling atoms by 
postulating on the part of the atoms a <i>self-determining power</i> by 
means of which some  
 <!--
EPICUREAN PHYSICS 179 
 --><A NAME="p179"></a>
 of them swerved slightly from the vertical line and thus<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> caused a 
circular or rotatory motion.<p>

In his account of <i>the origin of life</i> Epicurus accepted the 
theory of Empedocles, who held that all sorts of deformed and 
monstrous creatures first sprang from the earth, those alone surviving 
which were fit to support and protect themselves and to propagate their 
kind.<p>

The Epicurean account of human society is well known. Lucretius<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> 
taught that the men of olden times were as strong and as savage as 
beasts; that the primitive condition of the race was one of warfare; 
and that civil society was formed as a protection against anarchy and 
the absolute power of kings.<p>

Similarly, <i>religion</i>, according to the Epicureans, was of natural 
growth. <i>Fear</i> is the basis of religion.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> <i>Ignorance</i>, too, 
is a factor in the genesis of the religious instinct. It was owing to 
ignorance and fear that men attributed natural portents to the 
intervention of supernatural powers and sought to explain the 
regularity of the motion of the heavenly bodies by referring it to the 
agency of Providence. Nevertheless, Epicurus did not wholly abandon 
belief in the gods. The gods, he said, exist because they have appeared 
to men and left on the minds of men representative images 
(<b>prol&ecirc;pseis</b>).<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> They are immortal; they enjoy perfect 
happiness; formed of the finest atoms, they dwell in the uppermost 
parts of the universe, in the spaces between the stars. The popular 
notion, however, that the gods take an interest in human affairs is 
erroneous, because an interest in the affairs of men would be 
inconsistent with the perfect happiness which the gods enjoy.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The <i>human soul</i> is, like the gods, <i>composed of the finer kind 
of atoms</i>. It is a more subtle kind of body, resembling air and 
fire.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> More accurately, it is composed of air, fire, vapor, and 
 <!--
180 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p180"></a>
 a fourth element, which is nameless. This last constitutes the 
rational part (<b>logicon</b>) of the soul, which is seated in the 
breast, while air, fire, and vapor constitute the irrational part, 
which is scattered throughout the remainder of the body. Lucretius 
calls the rational part <i>animus</i>, or <i>mens</i>, and the 
irrational part <i>anima</i>.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup><p>

According to the Stoics, it is the soul which holds the body together; 
according to the Epicureans, it is the body which shelters the atoms of 
the soul, so that, when the protection afforded by the body ceases, as 
it does at the moment of death, the soul atoms are instantly 
scattered, owing to their extreme lightness.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> In this way Epicurus, 
keeping in mind the chief aim of all his physical inquiries, sought to 
rob death of its terrors by teaching that <i>there is no future 
life</i>. "Tota res ficta est pueriliter," as Cicero exclaims.<p>

Epicurus asserted the freedom of the will. He denied the existence of 
fate, but in his own analysis of human action he was obliged to 
substitute chance for fate. Despite his doctrine of freedom, he was 
forced to maintain that there is no truth in disjunctive propositions 
referring to the future.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Epicurean Ethics</b>. The Epicurean canonic and the general views 
which the Epicureans maintained in matters of physical science led 
inevitably to the conclusion that <i>the only unconditional good is 
pleasure</i>, a conclusion which is the basis of Epicurean ethics. The 
ethical system of Epicurus is simply a modified form of the Hedonism of 
Aristippus and the other Cyrenaics. When, however, Epicurus comes to 
define pleasure, he does not, like Aristippus, define it as a gentle 
motion: considering rather its negative aspect, he describes it as the 
absence of pain. He does not indeed omit the positive aspect; he merely 
insists that the negative aspect, repose of mind (<b>ataraxia</b>), is 
essential, while the gentle motion which constitutes positive 
 <!--
EPICUREAN ETHICS 181 
 --><A NAME="p181"></a>
 pleasure is secoridary and accidental.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> Unsatisfied desire is pain, 
and pain is destructive of mental repose; for this reason, and for this 
reason alone, should the desires be satisfied, and it is only in this 
way that positive pleasure becomes part of the highest good.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The difference between the Epicureans and the Cyrenaics is furthermore 
apparent in the Epicurean doctrine of the hierarchy of pleasures. 
Highest of all pleasures are those of the mind, namely, knowledge and 
intelligence, which free the soul from prejudice and fear, and 
contribute to its repose. For this reason the wise man should not place 
his hope of happiness in the pleasures of sense, but should rise to the 
plane of intellectual enjoyment. Here, however, Epicurus was 
inconsistent; he could not logically maintain a distinction between 
sense and intellect. Indeed, Diogenes<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> preserves a saying of Epicurus 
to the effect that there is no good apart from the pleasures of the 
senses, and Plutarch and others represent Metrodorus as maintaining 
that everything good has reference to the stomach.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In their application of the doctrine of pleasure the Epicureans recognize 
that each man is, in a certain sense, his own legislator. It is for him 
to determine what is useful or pleasant and what is harmful or painful. 
Hence the principle of moderation: <i>Restrain your needs and desires 
within the measure in which you will be able to satisfy them</i>. And, 
while no kind of pleasure is evil in itself, the wise man will avoid 
those pleasures which disturb his peace of mind and which, therefore, 
entail pain.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Virtue</i> has for the Epicureans a merely relative value. It is not 
good or praiseworthy in itself, but only so far as it is useful in 
securing that painlessness which is the happiness of life. The virtuous 
man secures the maximum of pleasure and 
 <!--
182 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p182"></a>
 the minimum of pain; <i>temperance</i> teaches him to avoid excess, 
and <i>courage</i> enables him to forego a pleasure or endure a pain 
for the sake of greater pleasure or less pain in the future. Less 
successful even than these attempts at finding a rational basis for 
courage and temperance is the Epicurean attempt at analyzing the virtue 
of <i>justice</i>; for justice in the Epicurean philosophy is based on 
the social compact into which primitive man entered as a means of
 self-defense and self-preservation. Cicero complains that the ethics 
of the Epicureans leaves no place for the sentiment of honor; a more 
serious fault is its failure to supply a rational basis for the virtue 
of justice.<p>

The claims which the Epicureans advanced on behalf of the wise man are 
similar to those advanced by the Stoics. The wise man alone is master 
of his desires; he is unerring in his convictions; he is happy in every 
circumstance and condition of life; and although he is not, as was the 
Stoic sage, wholly unemotional, still he holds his emotions in perfect 
control. Later, however, this ideal gradually degenerated, and despite 
the example of moderation set by Epicurus and his early followers, the 
wise man of Epicurean tradition became the model of the careless man of 
the world, with whom it is impossible to associate earnestness of moral 
striving.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The Stoic and the Epicurean schools, the 
two most important schools of the period, both sprang up and developed 
under the influence of the same external conditions. The internal 
principle of their development was, however, different. <i>The Stoics 
were fatalists; the Epicureans were casualists</i>. This difference in 
their conception of nature led to the difference in their view of 
practical life which is so apparent in their ethical systems. Yet there 
were points, theoretical as well as ethical, in which the two schools 
approached very close to each other. Both were materialistic in their 
physical systems and sensualistic in their theories of knowledge; both 
were illogical in their development of the idea of duty, although, 
 <!--
HISTORICAL POSITION OF EPICUREANISM 183  
 --><A NAME="p183"></a>
 as Zeller points out, the charge of inconsistency is urged with less 
justice against the Epicureans than against the Stoics. The Epicureans 
defined philosophy as the art of making life happy, and for them 
happiness was primarily a matter of feeling rather than of knowledge, 
while the Stoics defined happiness as consisting in a life led in 
harmony with nature. For the Stoic, therefore, the study of nature and 
the adoption of a consistent theory of nature were of greater 
importance than they were for the Epicurean.<p>

The physics of the Epicureans differs, as has been said, from the 
physics of Democritus in regard to the doctrine of the swerving motion 
of the atoms, -- an admission which destroys the consistency of 
Democritus' theory. This theory was at least not self-contradictory: 
the Epicurean theory is a mixture of dynamism and mechanism which 
cannot stand a moment's serious investigation.<p>

The ethics of the Epicurean school is simply the Hedonism of Aristippus 
refined under a broader idea of culture and a more enlightened concept 
of Socratic Eudemonism. In spite of Socratic influence, the Epicurean 
ethics is not, in the strict sense of the word, a system of morality at 
all. It contains no principles of morality; it reduces right and wrong 
to a matter of individual feeling, substituting for <i>good</i> and 
<i>evil</i> the categories <i>pleasant</i> and <i>painful</i>.<p>
