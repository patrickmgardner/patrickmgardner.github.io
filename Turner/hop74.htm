CONCLUSION</h3><p>

We have traced the origin and growth of philosophical opinions, 
outlined the development of schools and systems of philosophy, and 
indicated what seemed in each case to be an advance in or a 
retrogression of philosophic thought. There remains the task of 
inquiring into the general laws in obedience to which philosophy took 
in the course of its development the particular direction which it has 
taken.<p>

That at one time rather than at another, in one place rather than in 
another, men should appear whose lives and thoughts had a decisive 
influence on the course of the development of philosophy, that 
countless factors, hereditary, temperamental, educational, and so 
forth, should result in determining the philosophical career of such 
men, -- these are phenomena the origin of which lies beyond the scope 
of the philosophy of history; they are <i>data</i>, which must be 
considered as given by experience, in much the same way as the innate 
tendency to vary is taken as a <i>datum</i> by the biologist, who 
restricts his investigation to answering the question, How is this 
tendency affected by 
 <!--
654 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p654"></a>
 environment? The task of the philosophy of history is merely to 
inquire how such data were influenced by social, political, religious, 
and other influences. Starting, therefore, with the unexplained 
appearance of Plato, Aristotle, St. Augustine, St. Thomas, Descartes, 
Spinoza, how may we formulate the laws according to which these and 
other contributors to the development of philosophic thought were 
influenced by the internal and external conditions which, combined with 
the personal factor commonly called genius, produced the changes and 
vicissitudes of the history of philosophy?<p>

The laws of historical development are <i>a posteriori</i> laws. They 
are not to be deduced from <i>a priori</i> principles, but built up by 
a process of inductive reasoning from the study of the facts of 
history. This does not mean that history is the resultant of forces 
acting capriciously, but that the forces which produce historical 
development -- being dependent on physical conditions, mental 
temperament, and the action and interaction of social institutions, 
customs, and organizations -- are contingent, not necessary causes; 
that consequently the philosophy of history is not a geometry of the 
evolution and play of such forces; and that the laws which it seeks to 
establish are not deductions from definitions and axioms, but 
generalizations, similar to the <i>post facta</i> generalizations of 
the statistician. Divine Providence and human reason are the two great 
factors which determine the course of history. Sometimes these two work 
in unison, sometimes they clash; and the result is progress or 
deterioration. Wars, revolutions, conquests, educational reforms, 
industrial reconstructions, are all the work of man's mind, directed 
but not coerced by Divine Providence. Now, Divine Providence works 
through secondary causes, and will, which is the motive power of mind, 
though free, is not capricious, but follows certain ascertainable laws 
in its efforts to advance to a higher social state. The ground of 
historical development is, therefore, reason; not pure reason, deducing 
 <!--
CONCLUSION 655 
 --><A NAME="p655"></a>
 events as the logical mind deduces categories, but reason rendered 
contingent by freedom, and always subject to the unreasoning opposition 
of passion and impulse. Consequently, the laws of historical 
development are not <i>a priori</i> principles, as they should be if 
the ground of history were pure reason, nor are they mere aggregations 
of facts, as they should be if the ground of history were blind force. 
They are <i>a posteriori</i> inductions, based on observations, neither 
purely logical nor biological, but psychological.<p>

The laws of historical development are organic laws; that is to say, 
they deal with vital phenomena. Now, organic laws differ from 
mechanical laws in this, that, while the latter may be expressed with 
quantitative accuracy, the former can lay claim to qualitative 
definiteness merely. In physics, chemistry, astronomy, and geology, 
the amount of force expended can be calculated and expressed in terms 
of some unit of measurement, and the verification of the laws of these 
sciences includes the establishment of a quantitative equivalence 
between the force expended and the work accomplished. But when once we 
cross the threshold of the biological sciences we must be content with 
the formulation of laws which are definite in every respect save that 
of quantity.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> When, therefore, the laws of historical development 
formulate the relations between cause and effect they do not pretend to 
specify the definite amount of action and reaction.<p>

Another peculiarity of the laws of historical development results from 
what is commonly called the <i>continuity of history</i>. This is based 
on a quality common to all manifestations of vital activity, namely, 
the absolute indelibleness of an effect once produced on the living 
organism. "It is the peculiarity of living things," writes Clifford, 
"not merely that they change under the influence of surrounding 
circumstances, but that any change which takes place in them is not 
lost but retained, and, as it 
 <!--
656 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p656"></a>
 were, built into the organism to serve as the foundation for future 
actions. If you cause any distortion in the growth of a tree and make 
it crooked, whatever you may do afterwards to make the tree straight, 
the mark of your distortion is there it is absolutely indelible; it has 
become part of the tree's nature. . . . No one can tell by examining a 
piece of gold how often it has been melted and cooled in geologic ages, 
by changes of the earth's crust, or even in the last year by the hand 
of man. Any one who cuts down an oak can tell by the rings in its trunk 
how many times winter has frozen it into widowhood, and summer has 
warmed it into life. A living being must always contain within itself 
the history not merely of its own existence but of all its 
ancestors."<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> This peculiarity of living organisms, which may be 
likened to the <i>vis inertiae</i> of physical force, appears in 
aggregate life as the continuity of history, and conditions the 
development of philosophy as well as that of every other vital product.<p>

The <i>philosophy of the history of philosophy</i> is, therefore, the 
study of the organic laws in obedience to which philosophy took the 
particular course which it did take in its historical development. Some 
of these laws we have already observed as occasion offered; we have 
observed, for example, that a period of national enthusiasm and 
national prosperity is usually one of great activity, and in particular 
of great constructive activity, in philosophy; we have observed that 
the era of introspective philosophy corresponds with the period of 
mental maturity of a nation. Similarly, laws may be formulated 
expressive of the influence which climate, racial characteristics, 
literature, art, religion, etc., exercise on philosophy. Or, again, 
laws may be formulated in reference to conditions which are internal to 
philosophy itself, as for example that psychology is first dogmatic and 
afterwards critical, or that a system of ethics is determined by the 
psychology of the author or the school. We are not, 
 <!--
CONCLUSION 657 
 --><A NAME="p657"></a>
 however, concerned here with such particular laws, but rather with the 
general formula under which all the particular laws, external and 
internal, of the history of philosophy may be subsumed.<p>

Such a general formula is <i>development</i>. In the course of its 
history, philosophy has passed from a relatively simple to a relatively 
complex condition, from a homogeneous to a heterogeneous state, from 
indeterminateness to determinateness. But what are the characters of 
this development? A glance at the succession of philosophical systems 
will convince us that the evolution of philosophy <i>has not followed 
"an increasing purpose"</i>; philosophy has not always and everywhere 
passed from less to greater perfection; it has not gathered momentum as 
it came down the ages; truth has not come down to us gaining power and 
volume in its course, like the avalanche in its descent from the 
mountain top. If philosophy were the gradual unfolding of an idea, if 
that idea were the only reality, and if its evolution were consequently 
monistic, the progress of philosophy should have been "a triumphal 
march from victory to victory, through province after province of newly 
acquired truth, without a single reverse, without ever retreating from 
territory once fairly won." Such, we know, has not been the history of 
the philosophical sciences: the development of philosophy has followed 
a more complicated course than that of continued increase in 
perfection.<p>

Comte, it will be remembered, distinguished three stages in the 
development of human thought; namely, the theological, the 
metaphysical, and the positive, or scientific. This generalization is 
one-sided; it judges all thought from the view point of positivistic 
prepossessions. Besides, it is inaccurate; for there have been 
alternations of the metaphysical and the scientific periods in 
philosophy. The age of Plato was metaphysical, that of Archimedes, 
Euclid, and Ptolemy was scientific; the thirteenth century returned to 
metaphysics, the sixteenth was pre&euml;minently a scientific century, 
while the nineteenth went back to metaphysics 
 <!--
658 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p658"></a>
 in the form of transcendentalism. Still less accurate is Cousin's 
generalization, according to which philosophy has passed successively 
through the stages of sensism, idealism, scepticism, mysticism, and 
eclecticism. According to Hegel, philosophy has, in the course of its 
development, assumed different forms, each of which it successively 
transcends, thus gaining a fuller, richer, and more concrete content, 
so that the progress of philosophy corresponds to the development of 
the logical categories, <i>Being</i> (Eleatics), <i>Becoming</i> 
(Heraclitus), <i>Individuality</i> (Atomists), etc. No one will, 
however, maintain that Hegel's generalization meets with more than an 
approximate verification from the study of the facts of history.<p>

We shall be content here with describing the development of philosophy 
in general terms as a process of alternate progress and retrogression,  
-- a vast connected growth from lower to higher, with alternating 
periods of stagnation or degeneracy. This alternation of progress and 
retrogression is a characteristic of all development. Even in the 
evolutionary hypothesis the survival of the fittest does not 
necessarily mean the survival of the best. Indeed, rhythm is a quality 
of all motion whatsoever: in the physical, in the physiological, in the 
psychological, as well as in the social order, progress is essentially 
conditioned by periodicity. As in the individual life, so in the 
aggregate life, there is a fluctuation of vitality, a rise and fall. 
The line which represents human progress in industry, in art, in 
literature, and in philosophy is not an ascending vertical, nor a 
straight line ascending obliquely from the horizontal, but an 
undulating curve, like the record of the pulsation, now rising above 
the horizontal, now falling below it, representing at different points 
the same height of perfection or the same depth of degeneracy, but 
never representing exactly the same condition of human progress. The 
motion of the rowboat floating with the tide, rising and falling with 
each successive wave, yet constantly moving forward, so that while it 
often rises to the same height, it never rises 
 <!--
CONCLUSION 659 
 --><A NAME="p659"></a>
 twice to the same point of space, is an image of the progress of human 
thought, human customs, and even human fashions, which are constantly 
changing and constantly returning to previous conditions, without ever 
completing the circle of regression. The continuity of life demands 
that each successive moment in life recapitulate the entire past. 
<i>Eadem sed aliter!</i><p>

If we are to reduce to general terms the forces which combine to cause 
this progress and retrogression of philosophic thought, we shall find 
that on the side of progress are the power of Him Who wishes all men to 
come to a knowledge of the truth, the attractiveness of truth itself, 
the impetus given to philosophic speculation by a Plato, an Aristotle, 
an Aquinas, and the enthusiasm of their followers; while opposed to 
progress are the necessity of daily toil, the commercial spirit, greed, 
unworthy ambition, war, cruelty, despotism, superstition, conservatism, 
fanaticism, love of novelty, loyalty to tradition, and intellectual 
sloth. Through these agencies does Divine Providence work out its 
designs, by these conditions is human reason aided or hindered in its 
effort to arrive at a knowledge of the ultimate nature of things, and 
by these factors are the rise and fall of philosophy determined. From 
Thales to Aristotle there is one great wave of progress which, though 
ruffled by petty wavelets of less successful movements, moves onward 
until, contemporaneously with the downfall of Greece's political 
independence, it begins to sink to the calm level of indifference to 
speculative effort. The wave of progress next appears in the doctrines 
of the Alexandrian school; it differs in aspect from the wave which 
preceded it, -- is less compact in form and more easily broken. In the 
early centuries of the Christian era the philosophical movement gathers 
strength once more, and rises to its greatest height in the thirteenth 
century, after which conservatism, indifference, and sloth play the 
part of retrograding forces, until with the opening of the modern era 
another movement begins. This movement has continued with alternating 
rise<p>

660 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY<p>

 and fall until our own day. It has risen at those points where men 
like Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz, Kant, and Hegel have appeared; it has 
fallen wherever adverse influences have predominated; but never has it 
risen to the altitude attained by that wave of human thought whose 
crest touched heaven itself, when reason and faith were united in one 
system of knowledge. Whither will this movement bear us? It will carry 
us forward, -- we cannot resist the progress of historical development, 
-- but will it raise us to a height as great as that to which the past 
attained? All will depend on the principles on which philosophical 
speculation in the future will rest.<p>

It has been well said that a cripple on the right road will reach his 
destination sooner than the swiftest runner who has started in the 
wrong direction. Philosophy to-day realizes more than ever the 
importance of a right start and a correct method. If, therefore, much 
of recent speculation has made a wrong start, the sooner we return to 
the principles of former and more successfully constructed systems, 
principles often harshly expressed, yet plainly pointing towards the 
truth, the sooner will a genuine reform of philosophic method be 
possible. The fullest appreciation of the past is compatible with the 
most complete originality. To modern philosophers the challenge has ere 
now been addressed: "Ye have removed our landmarks; give us others that 
are better. . . . Ye have taken away our foothold; what have ye surer 
and safer in its place?" The present has much to learn from the past. 
If it is vain to strive to stem the progress of the world, it is 
equally vain to neglect the study of the past and to spend one's time 
in gloomily forecasting the future. The principles which the past has 
bequeathed to us should be adapted to the requirements of the future, 
and the motto by which all enlightened advancement should be guided is, 
<i>Vetera novis augere et perficere</i>.<p>
