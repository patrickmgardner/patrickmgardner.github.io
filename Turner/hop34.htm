ECLECTICS</h3><p>

Although <b>John of Salisbury</b> is perhaps the only professedly 
eclectic philosopher of this period, the eclectic tendency is apparent 
in <b>Peter the Lombard, Alanus of Lille, Gerard of Cremona</b>,<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> and 
others.<p>

JOHN OF SALISBURY<p>

<b>Life</b>. John of Salisbury, after completing his preliminary 
studies in England, went to Paris (about 1136), where he had for 
teachers many of the most renowned masters of the schools,  --  
Abelard, William of Conches, Theodoric of Chartres, Walter of Mortagne, 
and Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e. He lived on terms of friendship with St. 
Thomas Becket, Henry II of England, and Pope Adrian IV. In 1176 he 
became bishop of Chartres, and died there in 1182.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. In addition to his letters, which shed so much light on 
the history of his times, John of Salisbury wrote a large number of 
philosophical works, of which the most important are the 
<i>Polycraticus</i> and the <i>Metalogicus</i>. These are published by 
Migne, <i>Patr. Lat.</i>, Vol. CXCIX.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

John contributed very little to the philosophical discussions which 
occupied to such an extent the minds of his contemporaries. He was a 
historian, a humanist, and a critic, rather than a dialectician. 
Indirectly, however, he rendered valuable service to the cause of 
philosophy by his advocacy of culture, and by his 
 <!--
300 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p300"></a>
 denunciations of obscurantism, which was represented in those days by 
the <i>Cornificians</i> (pseudonym), a sect which flourished about the 
middle of the twelfth century.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> But, while advocating culture, and 
studying the opinions of his contemporaries, he recognized the danger 
of dialectic run riot, and strove in his eclectic synthesis to give 
philosophy a more practical turn. He devoted some attention to the 
study of psychology, being influenced, apparently, by the physiological 
method of William of Conches. It must not be forgotten that John of 
Salisbury is the first mediaeval historian of philosophy. To him we owe 
much of what is known about the great controversy of his century 
concerning the problem of universals.<p>

PETER THE LOMBARD<p>

<b>Life</b>. Peter the Lombard, surnamed <i>Magister Sententiarum</i>, 
was born at Novara in Lombardy, about the beginning of the twelfth 
century. He studied first at Bologna and afterwards at Paris. At Paris 
he taught theology for many years and was promoted to the bishopric of 
that city. He died about the year 1160.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Peter's <i>Four Books of Sentences</i> is a collection 
of the opinions of the Fathers on questions of Catholic dogma. It is 
modeled, apparently, on previous compilations. It became, and for 
several centuries remained, the text-book of the schools and was made 
the subject of commentaries innumerable. Around the exposition and 
defense of dogma contained in these commentaries there grew up problems 
of metaphysics and psychology, so that in the thirteenth century the 
<i>Books of Sentences</i> was the core of Scholastic literature. The 
work is published by Migne, <i>Patr. Lat.</i>, Vol. CXCII.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Peter the Lombard was primarily a theologian. In matters of 
philosophical discussion he strove to maintain a neutral attitude. His 
orthodoxy was attacked, though unsuccessfully, by Walter of St. Victor, 
representative of the mystic school. 
 <!--
ALANUS OF LILLE 301  
 --><A NAME="p301"></a><p>

Another writer of <i>Sentences</i> was Cardinal Robert Palleyn or 
Pulleyn. He was a distinguished teacher, and was connected both with 
the theological schools of Paris and with those of Oxford. The date of 
his death is 1154. His work is entitled <i>Sententiarum Libri 
Octo</i>.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup>
  
ALANUS OF LILLE (<i>ab Insulis</i>)<p>

<b>Life</b>. Alanus was born about 1128 at Lille in Flanders. It is 
probable that towards the middle of the twelfth century he taught at 
Paris. He died at Citeaux in 1202 or 1203.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The most important of Alanus' works are the <i>Ars 
Catholicae Fidei, Tractatus contra Haereticos, Theologicae Regule, De 
Planctu Naturae</i>, and <i>Anticlaudianus</i>. These are published by 
Migne, <i>Patr. Lat.</i>, Vol. CCX; the edition, however, is 
uncritical, and includes several treatises the authorship of which is 
doubtful.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> The classic work on Alanus is Baumgartner's <i>Die Philosophie 
des Alanus de Insulis</i> (M&uuml;nster, 1896).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

It is incorrect to represent Alanus as a mystic.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> He exhibits, it is 
true, some of the characteristics of the mystic style, -- poetic 
imagery, allegorical diction, etc. Nevertheless, he attaches 
independent value to speculative thought, and while he holds that 
reason cannot comprehend the mysteries of faith, he maintains that 
authority needs the aid of reason: "Quia auctoritas cereum habet nasum, 
id est, in diversum potest flecti sensum, rationibus roborandum 
est."<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> Instead, however, of presenting an original synthesis of 
philosophical doctrine, he merely collects and tries to reconcile the 
doctrines of his contemporaries. It is possible that this eclectic 
spirit of his teaching was the occasion of the surname <i>Doctor 
Universalis</i> by which he was known. This eclecticism appears  
 <!--
302 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p302"></a><p>

<b>In his Psychology</b>, which is a somewhat bewildering syncretism 
of Pythagorean, Augustinian, and Aristotelian doctrines. Having defined 
matter as chaotic space, and form as the sum of properties, he cannot 
admit the Aristotelian doctrine of the union of soul and body. The soul 
and the body are independent substances united by means of a <i>spiritus 
physicus</i>. The relations of body and soul are regulated by 
number.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>In his Cosmology</b>, which is dominated by the idea of number as 
constitutive of order, Alanus maintained that intermediate between God 
and creatures is a kind of world-soul, -- the servant of God, "Dei 
auctoris vicaria."<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Alanus of Lille, Peter the Lombard, and the 
other writers of this group exhibit a tendency to escape from the 
dialectical discussions of the schools by taking refuge either in the 
eclectic position, that all systems are partially true, or in the 
mystic position, that all purely rational systems are essentially 
inadequate. The tendency towards mysticism appears more plainly in the 
writings of the philosophers belonging to the next group.<p>
