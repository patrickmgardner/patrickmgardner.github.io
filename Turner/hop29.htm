ROSCELIN 269  
 --><A NAME="p269"></a>
<h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXIX<br>
ROSCELIN</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. Roscelin of Compi&egrave;gne was born either at 
Compi&egrave;gne, or as is more probable, in lower Brittany, about the 
middle of the eleventh century. He studied at Soissons and at Rheims. 
In 1098 he became canon of Compi&egrave;gne and taught in that city, 
and later at Besan&ccedil;on and at Tours. Among his many disciples was 
Abelard. On account of the great number of those who flocked to hear 
him and partly also on account of the development which he gave to 
Aristotle's dialectical doctrines, Roscelin was styled <i>Novi Lycaei 
Conditor</i>. He died about 1100.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. It appears that Roscelin did not commit his doctrines 
to writing, contenting himself with promulgating and defending them 
orally. There has come down to us, however, a letter addressed by him 
to Abelard<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> dealing chiefly with Roscelin's Trinitarian doctrine. 
Apart from this document we have no sources of information except the 
statements of <i>Anselm, Abelard</i>, and <i>John of Salisbury</i>, who 
were Roscelin's opponents. Monograph: M. Picavet, <i>Roscelin d'apres 
la legende et d'apres l'histoire</i> (Paris, 1896).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

From the sources mentioned in the preceding paragraph we derive the 
following points of doctrine:<p>

1. Roscelin taught that universals are mere flatus vocis. Anselm<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> 
says: "Illi utique nostri temporis dialectici, imo dialectice 
haeretici, qui nonnisi flatum vocis putant universales substantias. . . 
." John of Salisbury refers the same opinion to Roscelin by name: 
"Alius ergo, consistit in vocibus, licet haec opinio cum Rucelino suo 
omnino jam evanuerit."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> From these passages we infer that Roscelin 
was a nominalist, although the expression <i>flatus vocis</i> is 
obviously the phrase used by his opponents rather than by Roscelin 
himself to describe his doctrine.

2. Consistently with his nominalistic doctrines that the genus and 
species have no substantial unity, -- that the union of individuals in 
the genus or in the species is a mere fabrication of language or at 
most the work of thought, -- Roscelin maintained that the distinction 
of the whole and its parts is also the result of mere mental analysis. 
Thus Abelard declares: "Fuit autem, memini, magistri nostri Roscelini 
tam insana sententia ut nullam rem partibus constare vellet, sed sicut 
solis vocibus species, ita et partes adscribebat";<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> and elsewhere,<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> 
after describing his former teacher as "pseudo-dialecticus et 
pseudo-christianus," he argues that when the Gospel tells us that Christ 
ate part of a fish Roscelin would be compelled to maintain that Christ 
ate part of a word.<p>

3. Roscelin did not hesitate to apply his nominalism to the <i>doctrine 
of the Blessed Trinity</i>.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> The one nature in three divine persons 
must, he argued, be a universal. Now, the universal has no real 
existence. Therefore, he concluded, the oneness of the divine nature is 
not real (<i>tritheism</i>). That Roscelin held this doctrine is 
evident from the references of St. Anselm,<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> from Abelard's epistle to 
the bishop of Paris, and from Roscelin's letter to Abelard.<p>

4. It appears from the testimony of St. Anselm that Roscelin either 
taught or was suspected of teaching the tenets of sensism. In <i>De Fide 
Trinitatis</i>, Cap. 2, Anselm is evidently speaking of Roscelin's school 
when he says:<p>

<blockquote>
In eorum quippe animabus ratio, quae et princeps et judex omnium debet 
esse, quae sunt in homine, sic est in imaginationibus corporalibus 
obvoluta ut ex eis se non posset evolvere nec ab ipsis ea quae ipsa 
sola et pura contemplari debet valeat discernere.  
</blockquote><p>

In the fifth chapter of the same treatise allusion is made to the 
danger of passing from sensistic empiricism to <i>rationalism</i>: 
"Nolentes credere quod non intelligunt, credentes derident." 
 <!--
CONDEMNATION OF ROSCELIN 271  
 --><A NAME="p271"></a><p>

<b>Condemnation of Roscelin</b>. Scholastic philosophy contained from 
the very outset an element of rationalism, which Cardinal 
Gonz&aacute;lez<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> describes as "Un racionalismo sui generis." The 
Scholastic movement was the outcome of an intellectual renaissance of 
Christian civilization, and hence the danger arose of claiming for 
reason too much freedom in the domain of theological inquiry. The peril 
which Scholasticism had to fear was twofold: the abuse of reason on the 
part of the rationalist and the undue restriction of reason on the part 
of the mystic. <b>Fulbert</b> of Chartres (died 2029), <b>Othlo</b> of 
Regensburg (died 1083), and <b>St. Peter Damian</b> (998-1073) had 
already sounded the note of alarm, and had condemned the abuse of 
dialectic. <b>Berengar</b> of Tours (999-2088) had brought discredit on 
the Scholastic movement by his heterodox views on the question of 
transubstantiation, and his condemnation in 1050 by four different 
councils resulted in a more or less widespread suspicion of all 
philosophers and of philosophy itself. Under the influence of 
<b>Lanfranc</b> (1005-1089), abbot of Bec, and afterwards archbishop of 
Canterbury, there began what may be described as a reaction against the 
use of dialectic. The effect of Roscelin's Trinitarian error was 
similar to that of Berengar's heresy.<p>

At the council of Soissons, held in 1092, Roscelin was obliged to 
retract his heretical teachings concerning the Trinity, but he 
continued, apparently, to teach his nominalistic dialectic. Again, in 
1094, he was cited before the council of Rheims, and again he retracted 
(<i>abjuravit</i>). Afterwards, however, if St. Anselm is correct,<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup>
Roscelin asserted that he retracted "quia a populo interfici timebat." 
Picavet<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> makes no mention of the second council, and maintains that the 
council of Soissons never condemned Roscelin; that, in fact, it could 
not condemn him, because he repudiated the doctrines attributed to him 
by John, a monk of the abbey of Bec.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> Nevertheless, Roscelin was 
virtually condemned by public opinion, and although after his brief 
sojourn in England he was restored to the dignity of canon and was even 
allowed to teach, he gave occasion to Anselm and others to look with 
suspicion on the use of dialectic argumentation, and on any attempt at 
opposing the realism which was the traditional view, -- the <i>antiqua 
doctrina</i>, as Abelard calls it. 
 <!--
272 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p272"></a><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Roscelin is not to be dismissed with the 
remark that he was "a dangerous heretic." His heretical doctrines are 
indeed to be deplored both because of the errors which they contain and 
because of the momentary discredit which they brought on the Scholastic 
movement; but it must be remembered that Roscelin remained faithful to 
his Catholic convictions, and by the strictness of his conformity to 
Christian ideals of conduct earned the right of criticising his 
contemporaries. In this respect he is to be contrasted with his pupil, 
Abelard, who was a rationalist devoid of all reverence for dogma and 
for traditional morality. Roscelin was an independent thinker who 
carried freedom of thought to the verge of rationalism. He represents 
an important phase of the Scholastic movement, -- the beginning of the 
age of dialectic madness, through which the movement had to pass before 
reaching the age of constructive activity.<p>
