POST-NICENE FATHERS</h3><p>

The period extending from the Council of Nicaea (325) to the end of the 
fifth century was one of great literary and speculative activity in the 
Christian Church; for, although the definitions of the council stayed 
the progress of the Arian heresy, still the contest with the Arians was 
by no means ended. Day by day the theology of the Church was organized 
into a system which offered an impregnable front to heretic and 
schismatic, and, side by side with theology, there developed a stronger 
and more complete philosophy which, chiefly through the influence of 
the Latin Fathers, discarded the last remnants of Neo-Platonism and 
Gnosticism, and sought inspiration in the earlier and healthier form of 
Platonic teaching.<p>

Among the Greek Fathers of this period are <b>Athanasius</b> of 
Alexandria (died 373) and the three Cappadocians, <b>Gregory</b> of 
Nyssa (331-394), <b>Basil</b> (died 379), and <b>Gregory Nazianzen</b> 
(born 
 <!--
POST-NICENE FATHERS 223 
 --><A NAME="p223"></a>
 330). These men devoted their energies to the defense of the Church in 
the great Trinitarian controversy, as did also Cyril of Alexandria 
(died 444) in the controversy with Nestorius concerning the personality 
of Christ.<p>

Besides these writers there flourished, towards the end of the 
Patristic period, two others who devoted special attention to 
philosophy -- <b>Pseudo-Dionysius</b> and <b>St. John of 
Damascus</b>.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Pseudo-Dionysius</b>.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> The works entitled <i>De Divinis Nominibus, 
Theologia Mystica</i>, and <i>De Coelesti et Ecciesiastica 
Hierarchia</i>, which were at one time attributed to St. Dionysius the 
Areopagite, of whom mention is made in the Acts of the Apostles, are 
now universally acknowledged to belong to the end of the fifth century. 
They contain the last exposition of Christian Neo-Platonism. The 
ineffable superiority of God with respect to the world, the emanations 
(<i>processiones</i>) of creatures from God, the arrangement of all 
created beings in a scale of gradual descent from God, the final return 
of all things to their first source, the return of man to God by means 
of contemplative ecstasy -- all these Neo-Platonic elements are 
present in the philosophy of Dionysius. There can, however, be no doubt 
that Dionysius understood these doctrines in a sense perfectly 
compatible with the teaching of the Church. The works of Dionysius, as 
well as those of his follower, <b>Maximus Confessor</b> (580-662), were 
translated by John Scotus Erigena at the beginning of the Scholastic 
era.<p>

<b>St. John of Damascus</b> (end of the seventh century) composed a 
work entitled <i>Fountain of Knowledge</i> (<b>p&ecirc;g&ecirc; 
gn&ocirc;se&ocirc;s</b>) and a treatise <i>De Fide Orthodoxa</i>. In 
the former he gives an exposition  
 <!--
224 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p224"></a>
 of Aristotelian dialectic and ontology, or science of being. By some 
he is said to be the author of the saying, Philosophy is the handmaid 
of theology (<i>ancilla theologiae</i>). The phrase is probably of 
later origin.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Among the Latin Fathers of this period are to be mentioned <b>St. 
Hilary</b> (died 368), <b>St. Ambrose</b> (340-397), and <b>St. 
Jerome</b> (346 -420). They belong to the history of theology rather 
than to that of philosophy. It was in the writings of <b>St. 
Augustine</b> that Patristic philosophy attained the zenith of its 
course. Augustine is the greatest as well as the last of the masters of 
speculative thought who made it possible for the Patristic age to hand 
down to the Middle Ages a complete system of Catholic theology. At the 
same time he stands among the foremost of the world's great 
philosophers.<p>

ST. AUGUSTINE<p>

<b>Life</b>. Aurelius Augustinus was born at Tagaste, in Numidia, in 
the year 354. His father, Patricius, was a pagan; his mother, Monica, 
was a most exemplary Christian. At Madaura and at Carthage, whither he 
went for the purpose of completing the education begun in his native 
city, Augustine was lured into the career of sin which he dercribes in 
his <i>Confessions</i>. During this period of his life it seemed to him 
that the Manichean sect offered the best solution of the enigma of 
existence. Later, however, when, after having completed his education, 
he taught rhetoric at Carthage and at Rome, the contradictions in which 
he perceived Manicheism to be involved drove him to the Academy, where 
he learned to be content with probability in lieu of certainty. There 
also he learned to study Plato, and it was Plato who first stirred 
within his soul the impulse to rise from the moral degradation into 
which he had fallen. To the influence of these studies must be added 
the prayers of his mother and the persuasive eloquence of St. Ambrose. 
Augustine was baptized in the year 387. After his conversion he devoted 
himself to the study of the Scriptures, to the refutation of Manichean 
and other heresies, and to the task of instituting a systematic 
philosophical inquiry concerning God and the  
 <!--
ST. AUGUSTINE 225 
 --><A NAME="p225"></a>
 human soul. In 395 he was made bishop of Hippo, in Africa; he died In 
430, after thirty-five years of active episcopal administration.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The principal works of St. Augustine which are of 
interest In the study of his philosophy are <i>Contra Academicos Libri 
III, Soliloquia, De Immortalitate Animae, De Libero Arbitrio, De 
Civitate Dei, Confessiones, Retractationes</i>, and his treatises 
against the Manicheans. The treatise entitled <i>Principia 
Dialectices</i> 
may be genuine, although the treatise <i>Categoriae Decem</i>, which is 
usually appended to it, is certainly spurious.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>General Idea of Philosophy</b>. The central ideas of St. Augustine's 
philosophical inquiry are God and the human Soul. "Deum et animam scire 
cupio. Nihilne plus? Nihil omnino." "Deus, semper idem, noverim me, 
noverim te."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> On the problems of the existence of God and the nature 
of the soul, all philosophical science -- ethics, physics, dialectic
 -- is made to converge. Knowledge which cannot be brought to bear on 
the soul, teaching it to love God, is unprofitable; it is the knowledge 
which "puffeth up." Far from assenting to the maxim attributed to 
Tertullian, -- "Credo quia absurdum," -- Augustine viewed the relation 
between faith and reason in the light of the principles which the 
Scholastics formulated the maxims, "Credo ut intelligam," "Intelligo ut 
credam." He says, for example, in <i>De Praedestinatione 
Sanctorum</i>,<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> "Nullus quippe credit, nisi prius cogitaverit esse 
credendum," and in <i>De Vera Religione</i>,<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> "Nostrum est 
considerare quibus vel hominibus vel libris credendum sit." St. 
Augustine, however, does not define accurately the relations between 
philosophy and theology;<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> this was a task reserved for the master 
mind of the thirteenth century. 
 <!--
226 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p226"></a><p>

<b>Theory of Knowledge</b>. In his treatise <i>Contra Academicos</i>, 
St. Augustine begins by discussing the possibility of arriving at 
certain knowledge. The Academy maintained that a high degree of 
probability is the most that the human mind can attain. St. Augustine 
refutes this assertion, and proves by the following arguments that 
certitude is possible of attainment.<p>

1. Probability supposes certitude; for that is probable which is like 
the truth. If there is no truth, there is no probability.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup><p>

2. No one can be happy unless he possesses wisdom; for all men desire 
wisdom, and no one is happy unless he attains that which he desires. To 
deny that wisdom is possible of attainment, is, therefore, to deny that 
happiness is possible.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup><p>

3. The alleged inability of man to attain certitude is not founded on 
fact. It is not true that the senses are altogether untrustworthy, nor 
is it true that thought is utterly dependent on the impressions of the 
senses. It would be absurd to suppose that intellect is not more 
reliable than sense.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup><p>

4. The possibility of arriving at certainty may be proved by positive 
argument. For, whatever else is called in question, our own mental 
states are beyond the region of doubt. You may doubt whether you are 
one or multiple, you may doubt whether you are moving or at rest, but 
you cannot doubt that at this moment you think.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> You may contend that 
I am deceived, but the very fact that I am deceived proves that I 
exist. "Quod si fallor, sum!" A man's doubt proves that he exists, 
"Quandoquidem etiam si dubitat, vivit."<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

This last argument certainly suggests the Cartesian "Cogito, ergo sum." 
It must, however, be remembered, that while Descartes, according to the 
commonly received view, intended his argument to be a demonstration 
(if, indeed, he intended the "Cogito, ergo sum" to be an argument at 
all), Augustine 
 <!--
ST. AUGUSTINE'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 227 
 --><A NAME="p227"></a>
 intended the "Quod si fallor, sum," to be merely an indirect 
refutation of the principles of the Academy, and not a direct 
demonstration of the existence of the thinking subject.<p>

Having shown that certainty is possible of attainment, St. Augustine 
proceeds to inquire into the <i>conditions of intellectual 
knowledge</i>. There are two ways, he says, in which the human mind 
arrives at a knowledge of intelligible objects. The first is by rising 
from the data of sense to an understanding of the hidden causes of 
things, and, ultimately, to a knowledge of Him Who is the Highest 
Cause. This is the process of which St. Paul speaks: "Invisibilia Dei 
per ea qum facta sunt intellecta conspiciuntur."<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> The second method 
is one of introspection. "Noli foras exire," he says, "in te ipsum 
redi; in interiore homine habitat veritas."<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> The truth is indwelling 
in us. The most excellent means of attaining higher intellectual 
knowledge is the contemplation and study of our own intellectual life. 
For this, purity of heart and the practice of virtue are necessary. The 
purer the heart, the freer is the soul from all defilement, and the 
more perfectly will the mind mirror truth; for then it will mirror Him 
Who is the source of all truth. This leads to the next point in St. 
Augustine's theory of knowledge.<p>

<i>God is the source of all truth</i>. This principle is proved as 
follows: "In order to know anything as good or beautiful or true, and 
to distinguish it from what is not good or beautiful or true, we must 
possess a rule, or standard, by which our judgment regarding the object 
in question is determined." Our standard, in order to be trustworthy, 
must be immutable, and in order to be available, it must be present to 
our minds. Such a standard -- absolute, immutable, omnipresent 
goodness and truth and beauty -- is God.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> In this light, the light of 
eternal truth, is all truth known. Whether we rise in contemplation 
from the  
 <!--
228 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p228"></a>
 data of sense to the hidden world of intelligible objects, or from an 
introspective knowledge of self to a knowledge of higher truths, we do 
so in virtue of the illumination which is the light of the glory of 
God. In the Word of God, which is the wisdom of the Father, there dwell 
the unchangeable essences, the reasons of things (<i>rationes 
rerum</i>), the types according to which all things were made. To deny 
the existence of these archetypal forms would be to maintain that God 
created things irrationally. He, the all-wise Creator, made all things 
according to His wisdom, that is, according to the <i>rationes 
aeternae</i> indwelling in the Word: "Singula propriis creata sunt 
rationibus."<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> Corresponding to the ectypes in the world of concrete 
existence are the prototypes, whose <i>locus</i> is not a separate 
intelligible world, but the Divine Wisdom, the Logos, the Son of God. 
This, according to St. Augustine, is what Plato, inspired by biblical 
teaching, understood by the <b>topos no&ecirc;tos</b>.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup><p>

God is, therefore, the source of all truth and of all intellectual 
light. In Him are the essential types of truth; He it is Who illumines 
the ectypes so that from a knowledge of them we may rise to a knowledge 
of truth, and He it is Who illumines the soul itself from within, so 
that when we turn our thoughts inward on the soul, we may rise in 
contemplation to Him Who is the light of the soul, as the sun is the 
light of the physical world.<p>

In St. Augustine's theory of knowledge the lines of thought are 
undoubtedly Platonic. The Ontologists, however, are mistaken when they 
understand the Platonism of St. Augustine to include the doctrine of 
immediate intuition of God, or of the divine ideas. When he teaches 
that we know the essences of things <i>in rationibus aeternis</i>, he is 
careful to point out that we rise from the data of sense or from a 
study of our own intellectual life to a knowledge of these essences. 
His meaning is that the essences of things could neither be, nor be 
known by us, unless they first existed and were known in the mind of 
 <!--
ST. AUGUSTINE'S THEOLOGY 229  
 --><A NAME="p229"></a>
 God. That there is a divine element in our knowledge of created 
things, St. Thomas as well as St. Augustine maintained. It is God Who 
made the objects of our knowledge, Who endowed the mind with the power 
whereby it abstracts from the data of sense the necessary and universal 
element which is the object of thought, and Who cooperates in the act 
of the mind by which the potentially intelligible is rendered actually 
intelligible. In this sense does the Word illumine every man that 
cometh into the world. It is clear, then, that the Ontologists 
exaggerate the divine element in human knowledge when they maintain 
that we have immediate intuition of God and of the ideas contained in 
the Divine Mind. Such exaggeration was as far from the mind of the 
Plato of Christianity as it was from the mind of the great Christian 
Aristotle of the thirteenth century. It must be admitted, nevertheless, 
that the Platonic form of St. Augustine's teaching lends more favor to 
the Ontologist's interpretation than does the Aristotelian form in 
which St. Thomas expressed his theory of knowledge.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Theology and Cosmology</b>. While admitting the validity of the 
teleological argument for the existence of God, as well as that of the 
argument from the testimony of conscience,<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> St. Augustine bases his 
whole system of theodicy on the argument derived from the immutability 
and permanence of the object of our intellectual knowledge. The 
argument is as follows: We know the truth and we strive for the good. 
But nothing is true or good in this world of change and imperfection 
except in so far as it participates in the absolute truth and goodness 
of Him Who never changes. Whoever denies that God exists must be 
prepared to maintain that knowledge and virtue have no object. The 
existence of God is, therefore, <i>the essential condition of the moral 
and intellectual life</i>.  
 <!--
230 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p230"></a><p>

God cannot be comprehended by the human mind. He is <i>above all 
predicates and all categories</i>. When, therefore, we speak of Him, we 
are nearer to the truth when we say what He is not, than when we say 
what He is: when we speak of God we are little children lisping a 
language which we do not understand. "Deus melius scitur nesciendo," 
and again, "Venus, enim, cogitatur Deus quam dicitur, et venus est quam 
cogitatur." This truly Christian humility in presence of the great 
problems of theodicy we shall find to be as characteristic of the great 
masters of Scholasticism as it is of the greatest of the Patristic 
philosophers. The Fathers and the schoolmen were as willing as any 
modern agnostic is to admit the inability of the human mind to grasp 
the truth of God's nature and the inadequacy of human language to 
express our thoughts about God.<p>

God is immutable, eternal, all-powerful, all-knowing, absolutely devoid 
of potentiality or composition. He is form without matter, essence 
unparticipated.<p>

In his account of the <i>origin of the universe</i>, St. Augustine 
maintains that God from all eternity designed to create the world. God 
did not create matter, however, until the beginning of time; for before 
matter existed, time did not exist. God is the cause of matter as well 
as of intelligible being. He made it out of nothing (creation); it did 
not proceed from the substance of God (emanation).<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> Together with 
matter all things else were created at the beginning: "Creavit omnia 
simul." Creation was the act of an instant, the Mosaic account of the 
six days of creation being merely a description of the six orders or 
grades of perfection in which things were created. Not all things. 
however, were created in the full possession of what came to be called 
their specific perfection. Augustine distinctly admits a process of 
development, as when, in the treatise entitled <i>De Genesi ad 
Litteram</i>, he says: "In semine, ergo, illa omnia 
 <!--
ST. AUGUSTINE'S PSYCHOLOGY 231 
 --><A NAME="p231"></a>
 fuerunt primitus, non mole corporeae magnitudinis sed vi potentiaque 
causali" (V, 23). Here he is alluding to the <i>seminariae 
rationes</i>, of which he speaks elsewhere as destined ("cum data 
fuerit opportunitas temporalis et causalis") to develop 
(<i>prorumpere</i>) into their proper species.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup><p>

God is not the author of evil; He merely permits it. The order of the 
universe and the gradation of beings require that some things should be 
less perfect than others. God would not permit evil if He could not 
draw good from it. Moral evil alone is opposed to the Divine Will.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> 
Man is a microcosmos, a compendium of the universe. He is the only 
being that mediates between God and matter; for, while Augustine admits 
the existence of ministering angels, he rejects the whole celestial and 
terrestrial hierarchy of the Neo-Platonists.<p>

<b>Psychology</b>. The soul is simple, immaterial, spiritual. It is 
devoid of quantity: it has no extension in space. In his proof of the 
immateriality of the soul, St. Augustine has recourse, among other 
arguments, to the following, which was formulated before his time by 
Plotinus: If the soul were not immaterial, it could not be in all parts 
of the body at the same time. Now the soul is in all parts of the body 
at the same time, for wherever an impression is made upon the body, the 
soul perceives that impression, and it is not part of the soul that 
perceives, but the whole ego. Therefore, the soul is immaterial.<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The soul is essentially individual: the notion of a universal soul is 
absurd. Equally absurd is the doctrine of transmigration; for that 
which is immaterial cannot enter into composition with that which is 
material and irrational. Mortality is the only bond of kinship between 
man and brute. The angel, like man, possesses a body; but the angelic 
body is immortal. The brute possesses a mortal body, but the soul of 
the brute is irrational. Man is, therefore, unique in this, that he is 
an <i>animal rationale mortale</i>.  
 <!--
232 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p232"></a><p>

The arguments which St. Augustine adduces in favor of the 
<i>immortality of the soul</i> savor of Platonic influence. They are as 
follows:<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup><p>

1. That in which the imperishable exists must be imperishable. 
Imperishable truth dwells in the soul. Therefore the soul is 
imperishable.<p>

2. The soul is inseparable from reason; for reason and the soul are not 
united in space, and it is only in space that separation can take 
place. But reason is imperishable, because the principles of reason are 
immortal. Therefore the soul cannot perish.<p>

3. The body is animated, that is, endowed with life. The soul, on the 
contrary, <i>is</i> life. To maintain, therefore, that the soul could be 
deprived of life would be to say that life is not life or that the soul 
is not the soul.<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup><p>

With regard to the <i>origin of the soul</i>, St. Augustine teaches 
that the soul of Adam was created at the beginning: "Creavit Deus omnia 
simul." At some subsequent time the soul of Adam was united to the 
body, not because of any sin on the part of the soul, but because the 
soul requires the body. The souls of the descendants of Adam come into 
existence at the moment of their union with the body. As to how they 
come into existence, whether by an act of creation 
(<i>creationism</i>), or by virtue of the generative process by which 
the body originates (<i>traducianism</i>), St. Augustine is unable to 
decide.<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The soul and body together form one substance, -- man. The soul gives 
being and species to the body. It acts on the body. The body, however, 
has no independent power of acting on the soul: whatever power the body 
possesses is conferred on it by the soul itself. Between soul and body 
is interposed a subtle element, partaking at the same time of the 
material nature of the body and of the spiritual nature of the soul: it 
 <!--
ST. AUGUSTINE'S ETHICS 233 
 --><A NAME="p233"></a>
 is analogous to light and air. The function of this element is to 
mediate between the soul and the organs of the body, and to unite, in 
some mysterious manner, soul and body in one substance.<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The <i>faculties of the soul</i> are thus classified:<p>

<ul>
<li>Faculties of sense
<ul>
<li> Appetite
<li> Knowledtge
<ul>
<li>  External senses
<li>  Internal senses
<ul>
<li>  <i>Sensus communis</i>
<li>   Imagination, or <i>vis spiritualis</i>
<li>   Sensuous memory
</ul></ul></ul></ul><p>

<ul>
<li>Faculties of the soul as spirit
<ul>
<li> Will -- <i>Voluntas, Liberum Arbitrium</i>
<li> Knowledge
<ul>
<li>  Intelligence
<ul>
<li>   Intuitive -- <i>Mens</i>
<li>   Discursive -- <i>Ratio</i>
</ul>
<li>  Intellectual memory
</ul></ul></ul><p>

St. Augustine attaches special importance to the idea of will. 
"Voluntas est quippe in omnibus, omnes nihil aliud quam voluntates 
sunt."<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup> It is the will that moves the intellect to action, and it is 
the element of will in the act of faith that makes faith meritorious. 
Free will is the proximate cause of moral evil.<p>

St. Augustine's discussion of free will in its relation to grace and 
predestination belongs to the history of theology.<p>

<b>Ethics</b>. The <i>supreme good</i> of man consists in the eternal 
contemplation and love of God in the life to come. Here on earth man's 
duty is so to act that he may attain the happiness which is reserved 
for him beyond the grave. The path of duty is clearly marked out by the 
Divine Law. The destiny of the human soul and the law of God are, 
therefore, the determinants of moral good.<p>

To fulfill the law, man must practice <i>virtue</i>. Virtue is defined, 
"Ars bene recteque vivendi."<sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup> Virtue does not imply apathy, as the 
Stoics taught: the emotions are not to be destroyed or eradicated, but 
to be kept under control and restrained within the limits prescribed by 
<i>the Law of God</i>. Now the Law of God is 
 <!--
234 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p234"></a>
 the Law of Love. Man should love God above all things; he should love 
himself with a rational love, seeking what is best and doing what is 
best for himself in the light of his eternal destiny; he should love 
his fellow-man, desiring what is best for him and aiding him to attain 
it. Charity, therefore, which is love, is the foundation of all virtue: 
on this foundation are built <i>prudence, fortitude, temperance</i>, and 
<i>justice</i>.<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Even from this summary sketch of the 
philosophy of St. Augustine it is possible to glean something of the 
vastness of his system of speculative thought. His inquiries cover the 
whole range of speculation; he synthesizes the best elements of pagan 
philosophy into a system of Christian thought; and wherever his 
inquiries lead him he exhibits that spirit of coherent system, that 
perfect grasp of his subject, that sublimity of thought and language 
which distinguish him among all the philosophers of Christian times as 
the Plato of Christianity. And when we remember that St. Augustine was 
as distinguished among theologians as he was among philosophers, we 
realize that his was a mind almost superhuman in its transcendent power 
of synthesis.<p>

The debt which philosophy owes to St. Augustine includes, besides many 
original contributions to the definition of the Christian concept of 
God, of the human soul, and of the destiny and duty of man, the first 
essay on the part of a Christian philosopher to discover and expound 
the philosophy of human history. In the treatise <i>De Civitate Dei</i> 
he appears as the exponent of the "law of progress which governs the 
history of humanity, and of which even those who fight against it 
become instruments in the hands of Providence according to the Divine 
plan."<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup><p>

It is scarcely necessary to call attention to the preponderance of the 
influence of Plato on the philosophic thought of St. Augustine. Like 
all the other Fathers of the Church, St. Augustine 
 <!--
LATER PATRISTIC WRITERS 235 
 --><A NAME="p235"></a>
 esteemed Plato more highly than Aristotle. The latter he styled "Vir 
excellentis ingenii, et Platoni quidem impar, sed multos facile 
superans."<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup> Although, however, the era of Christian Platonism 
virtually came to an end with Augustine, the Scholastic era, in which 
the importance of Aristotle grew until it reached its maximum in the 
thirteenth century, was not oblivious of the debt which Christianity 
and philosophy owe to the man who first Christianized the teachings of 
Plato.<p>

The period between the death of St. Augustine and the rise of 
Scholasticism is one of comparatively little intellectual activity. 
Throughout Europe, men like <b>Claudianus Mamertus</b> (middle of fifth 
century), <b>Boethius</b> (470-526), <b>Cassiodorus</b> (468-575), 
<b>St. Isidore of Seville</b> (seventh century), and <b>Venerable 
Bede</b> (674-735) labored merely to preserve what the past had 
bequeathed and to transmit the legacy to times more favorable for the 
growth and development of Christian speculation.<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. Patristic philosophy exhibits all the 
characteristics of the age to which it belonged,  --  the era of the 
struggle and triumph of Christianity and of the first adjustment of 
Christian thought to pagan civilization and culture. To the period of 
struggle belongs the work of the Apologists; to the first centuries of 
triumph belong the earliest constructive attempts of the Alexandrian 
school; while to the later centuries of the period intervening between 
the triumph of Christianity and the invasion of the barbarians belongs 
St. Augustine's systematic effort to harmonize Christian teaching with 
the greatest achievements of pagan thought. After the time of St. 
Augustine, the condition of Christian Europe was not favorable to 
speculation, and it was not until the dawn of the era of Neo-Latin 
civilization that in new circumstances, and in a different social and 
political climate, the schoolmen completed the task begun by the 
Fathers. Patristic philosophy is fragmentary and devoid of

 unity. It belongs to an epoch in which everything except religion was 
decadent and in which religion itself, though vigorous, had not yet 
succeeded in infusing the Christian ideal into the life and thought of 
Europe. Scholastic philosophy will begin with the opening of the new 
era; it will grow into the new life of Christianized Europe, and will 
attain the golden age of its development whenever and wherever the 
ideal of the Christian life shall have transformed the social and 
political conditions into an atmosphere most congenial to Christian 
speculation. The Fathers defined, at least provisionally, the 
intellectual basis of the dogmatic system of the Church; they protested 
successfully against the gnostic, which was in reality the 
rationalistic, subordination of revelation to reason, and they stated 
the question which Scholastic philosophy took up and answered: How can 
reason and revelation be shown to be distinct and, at the same time, 
consistent sources of truth?<p>
