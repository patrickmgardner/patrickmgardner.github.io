GERMAN PHILOSOPHY (Continued)</h3><p>

In the movement which arose in opposition to Hegel's philosophy we may 
distinguish three currents: (1) the <i>Psychological</i> movement, 
represented by <b>Fries</b> and <b>Beneke</b>; (2) the <i>Realistic</i> 
movement, represented by <b>Herbart</b>; (3) the <i>Voluntarist</i> 
movement, represented by <b>Schopenhauer</b>.<p>

1. <b>Psychological Reaction against Hegelianism</b>. <b>Fries</b> 
(1773-1843), professor at Jena and at Heidelberg, and author of the 
<i>New Critique of Reason</i> (1807), adopted Kant's results, but 
rejected the method of transcendental criticism, substituting for it 
empirico-psychological inquiry, which he made the basis of all 
philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> He also admitted into his system of thought  
 <!--
584 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p584"></a>
 elements derived from the fideism of Jacobi. His work was continued 
and developed by <b>Beneke</b> (1798-1854), who succeeded to Hegel's 
chair in the University of Berlin (1832), and by <b>Ueberweg</b>
 (1826-1871), and <b>Fortlage</b> (1806-1881) who taught at 
K&ouml;nigsberg and at Jena respectively.<p>

2. <b>Realistic Metaphysics</b>. <b>Herbart</b> (1776-1841), after 
studying at the University of Jena, spent several years as private 
tutor in Switzerland, where he made the acquaintance of 
<b>Pestalozzi</b> (1746-1827), the founder of modern pedagogy. From 
1802 to 1809 Herbart taught at G&ouml;ttingen; in 1809 he was 
transferred to K&ouml;nigsberg, whence he was recalled to 
G&ouml;ttingen in 1833. His collected works were published in twelve 
volumes (Leipzig, 1850-1852) by his pupil Hartenstein.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Herbart took up the realistic elements of Kant's philosophy and 
combined them with Leibnizian monadism; the metaphysical system which 
he evolved from these premises he himself described as realism. He 
defines philosophy as <i>the elaboration of the concepts which underlie 
the different sciences</i>, thus outlining the task which he undertook; 
namely, (a) to restore realism, (b) to rehabilitate the principle of 
contradiction, and (c) to establish philosophy on a scientific basis.<p>

In his <i>metaphysics</i> he teaches that Being is not one, as the 
Eleatics and the pantheists held, but many. The multiple <i>realities 
(Realen)</i>, which constitute real being, correspond in a measure to 
the monads of Leibniz's philosophy; they differ, however, in this, that 
they are devoid not only of all perception and incipient consciousness, 
but of all activity whatsoever, except the power of self-preservation. 
Extension in space, action in time, inherence, causality involve 
contradictions, which philosophy removes by the elaboration of these 
concepts.<p>

In his <i>psychology</i> Herbart conceives the soul as a simple real 
essence, one of the <i>Realen</i>, and the ideas of the soul he  
 <!--
SCHOPENHAUER 585 
 --><A NAME="p585"></a>
 conceives to be acts of self-preservation. There are not, therefore, 
several faculties of the soul, but one faculty, the function of which 
is to preserve the soul in its indestructible originality. Perception 
arises from the conflict of this self-preserving tendency with the 
self-preserving tendency of other real beings. Mental states are thus 
<i>an equilibrium of opposing forces</i>, and Herbart, by attempting to 
reduce psychic life to a mechanism, the laws of which are the same as 
those of physics, forestalled the attempts of Fechner and Wundt to make 
psychology an exact science. The best known example of this mechanics 
of the mind is the attempt to determine the <i>sum of arrest</i> of 
ideas.<p>

Consistently with his rejection of the plurality of mental faculties, 
Herbart identifies will with thought, and teaches that the freedom of 
the will is merely the assured supremacy of the strongest idea or mass 
of ideas.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Herbart is distinguished by his "systematic 
opposition to the method, starting point, and conclusions of Hegel." 
His philosophy is a union of Eleatic, Leibnizian, and Kantian elements. 
We must not overlook the fact that Herbart devoted special attention to 
the pedagogical aspects of philosophy, his rejection of the plural 
concept of mind being of special importance on account of its influence 
on the development of the theory of education.<p>

3. <b>Voluntarism</b>. The most important of the anti-Hegelian 
movements was that inaugurated by Schopenhauer, a movement which may be 
described as an emphatic assertion of the importance of the
 non-rational in a philosophical synthesis.<p>

SCHOPENHAUER<p>

<b>Life</b>. Arthur Schopenhauer was born at Danzig in 1788. After 
traveling in France and England, he entered the University of 
G&ouml;ttingen and devoted himself to the study of the natural sciences 
and of Plato. From G&ouml;ttingen he went to Berlin, where Fichte was 
lecturing at the time; thence he went to Jena, and there obtained his 
doctor's degree, for which he wrote 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 586 
 --><A NAME="p586"></a>
 the dissertation entitled <i>The Fourfold Root of the Principle of 
Sufficient Reason (&Uuml;ber die vierfache Wurzel des Satzes vom 
zureichenden Grunde, 1813)</i>. During the four following years, which 
he spent at Dresden, he devoted much attention to the study of Hindu 
philosophy. His principal work, <i>Die Welt als Wille und 
Vorstellung</i>, appeared in 1819. After two unsuccessful attempts to 
expound his philosophy from the professor's chair and to stem the tide 
of Hegel's popularity at Berlin, he retired in 1831 to
 Frankfort-am-Main, where he spent the remainder of his life in learned 
retirement, indulging his moody and passionate temperament and 
elaborating a system of pessimism in which one may see, in addition to 
the influence of his Buddhistic studies, the reflection of the personal 
character of the man. He died in 1860.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Schopenhauer's <i>Complete Works</i> have been edited 
several times (for example, Leipzig, 1873-1874; second edition, 1877; 
Leipzig, 1890; and finally, Leipzig, 1894). The following works exist 
in English translations: <i>Fourfold Root, etc.</i> (London, 1891), 
<i>The World as Will, etc.</i> (3 vols., London and Boston, 1884-1886), 
<i>Essays</i> (5 vols., London and New York, 1896). The best English 
presentations of Schopenhauer's philosophy are to be found in Wallace's 
<i>Schopenhauer</i> (London, 1890), and Caldwell's <i>Schopenhauer's 
System in its Philosophical Significance</i> (New York, 1896).<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>General Character of Schopenhauer's Philosophy</b>. Kant, Plato, and 
the Buddhist philosophers contributed to the building of Schopenhauer's 
system of thought. From Kant and the Kantians was derived the 
transcendental element, -- the criticism with which Schopenhauer 
started, and the synthetic arrangement by which he grouped all the 
elements of thought under the absolute will. From Plato was derived the 
theory of Ideas as stages of the voluntary phenomenon; and from the 
Buddhists, the pessimism and the negation of will, which form the 
practical aspects of Schopenhauer's system. Mention must also be made 
of Hegel's influence, which, however, was wholly indirect. Indeed,  
 <!--
SCHOPENHAUER'S VOLUNTARISM 587 
 --><A NAME="p587"></a>
 it is hardly an exaggeration to say that Schopenhauer was a 
voluntarist because Hegel was an intellectualist, the former insisting 
on <i>the importance of the non-rational</i> because the latter 
identified the rational with the real.<p>

<b>Starting Point</b>. Schopenhauer, like Fichte and Schelling, starts 
with the Kantian resolution of noumenal reality into subject and object 
(thing-in-itself), and addresses himself, as they addressed themselves, 
to the task of analyzing the object with a view to <i>perfecting the 
Kantian synthesis</i>. Influenced to a greater extent than he was aware 
of by Fichte's subjectivism, he maintained that there is <i>no object 
without subject</i>. Instead, however, of resolving the subjective 
aspect of the object into a rational activity of the Ego, he resolved 
it into the volitional activity ot the <i>will</i>, which is not only 
the essence of man but also the essence of the universe.<p>

<b>The Fourfold Root</b>. In the treatise entitled <i>The Fourfold Root 
of the Principle of Sufficient Reason</i>, Schopenhauer teaches that 
the celebrated principle which had played so important a part in 
Leibniz' philosophy has four forms, corresponding to the four classes 
of representations to which it is applied; namely: (1) <i>principium 
rationis essendi</i>, as applied to formal intuitions; (2) 
<i>principium rationis fiendi</i>, as applied to empirical intuitions; 
(3) <i>principium rationis agendi</i>, as applied to acts of the will; 
and (4) <i>principium rationis cognoscendi</i>, as applied to abstract 
concepts.<p>

<b>The World as Representation</b>. In his most important work, <i>The 
World as Will and Representation</i>, Schopenhauer first takes up and 
evolves the epistemological principles which he had expounded in his 
earlier treatise. Here he lays special emphasis on the notion of 
causality. When we analyze our experience, he says, we find that all 
that is given is sensation or representation. The understanding, 
however, which may not be separated from sensation, immediately refers 
the representation to an external cause. Now if we were <i>merely 
rational</i> beings, endowed with 
 <!--
588 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p588"></a>
 sense and intellect, but devoid of volition, we should never be able 
to answer the question, What is the external cause of representation? 
It is by combining internal experience with external that we perceive 
<i>will</i> to be the ultimate real, the noumenal cause of the 
phenomenon. Will, therefore, determines our knowledge of reality and 
constitutes reality itself. Will governs knowledge.<p>

It is important to note that by <i>will</i> Schopenhauer understands 
not merely the faculty of choice but also impulse, the blind 
unreasoning impulse to self-preservation, which manifests itself in 
pleasure and pain, hope and fear, love and hatred, -- in a word, the 
<i>will-to-live</i>. To this blind impulse he subordinates knowledge, 
and although he claims that voluntarism is opposed to materialism on 
the one hand, and to subjective idealism on the other, the whole trend 
of his investigation of knowledge is towards the materialistic 
conclusion that understanding is a function of the brain. In this 
connection he quotes with apparent approval the celebrated saying 
attributed to Cabanis: "As the liver secretes bile, the brain secretes 
ideas."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>The will is absolute</i>. All representation is conditioned by 
causality, space, time, etc., which constitute the principle of 
<i>individuation</i>. The will is subject to none of these conditions; 
it is neither individual nor personal, although individual acts of the 
will (volitions), being merely representations, are subject to 
causality, space, time, and other individuating conditions.<p>

<b>The World as Will</b>. In the second book of the treatise above 
mentioned (<i>The World as Will, etc.</i>), Schopenhauer proceeds to 
the study of the external world, which is the will in the form of 
objectivity, that is, in the body which it creates for itself. Starting 
with <i>self</i>, he takes for granted as axiomatic that the human body 
is merely the external manifestation of the inner force which is human 
will. <i>The will may be said to create the body</i>: in truth, 
however, the inner volition and the outer bodily action 
 <!--
SCHOPENHAUER'S PESSIMISM 589 
 --><A NAME="p589"></a>
 are not cause and effect, but are merely the inner and the outer 
aspect of the same reality.<p>

Turning next to the world of natural phenomena he finds there the 
<i>all-permeating, all-producing will as natural force</i>. This force 
manifests itself in purely mechanical action and reaction, in chemical 
affinity, in the striving and unconscious appetition of vegetable life, 
and in the conscious self-preserving impulse of animals. Everywhere and 
at every moment will is indefatigably active, organizing, preserving, 
sustaining. It is will that endows the animal with weapons of defense 
and with the means of obtaining its food; it is will too that endows 
the animal with consciousness and man with intellect, for these are 
weapons like any other contrivance for escaping from the enemy or 
securing prey. Indeed, <i>intellect is the most perfect of all the 
weapons with which will has endowed creatures</i>, for as the ink sac 
of the cuttlefish serves to conceal the animal's flight or approach, so 
intellect serves to hide the intent of the will and thus to insure its 
success.<p>

The will-to-live, as manifested in vegetable, animal, and human life, 
is essentially a combative impulse; as one form of existence 
necessarily comes in the way of other forms there arises an inevitable 
struggle. Here Schopenhauer undoubtedly forestalls the Darwinian 
concept of nature as a <i>struggle for existence</i>. Yet, although he 
insists on the influence of want and environment on organic 
development, he is opposed to the Lamarckian hypothesis of the 
evolution of the higher from the lower species.<p>

<b>Pessimism</b>. Schopenhauer was by temperament and disposition 
inclined to dwell on the gloomy side of the picture of life which he 
presented in his doctrine of the struggle of nature. The only positive 
feelings, he taught, are those of pain: pleasure is the merely 
temporary satisfaction of a need, and is, therefore, negative. 
<i>Positive pleasure is an illusion</i>. "The simple truth is that we 
ought to be miserable, and we are so. The chief source of the serious 
evils which affect man is man himself; 
 <!--
590 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p590"></a>
 <i>homo homini lupus</i>. Whoever keeps this fact clearly in view 
beholds the world as a hell which surpasses that of Dante in this 
respect, that one man must be the devil of another. . . . Life is a 
path of red-hot coals with a few cool places here and there."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>The Escape from Bondage</b>. In the third and fourth books of the 
treatise, <i>The World as Will, etc.</i>, Schopenhauer undertakes to 
answer the question, How is man to escape from the bondage of will and 
the misery of life? In his answer he maintains throughout the 
individualistic standpoint: he has no belief in deliverance through the 
ultimate development of the race; each man must deliver himself. Now 
the means of deliverance are three: <i>art, sympathy</i>, and 
<i>negation of the will-to-live</i>.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Art</i>. When a man loses himself in artistic contemplation, pure 
perception takes full possession of his conscious life; the will 
disappears and with it all suffering. In this connection Schopenhauer 
attaches especial importance to music as a means of deliverance from 
the bondage of suffering. But, he confesses, it requires a very great 
effort to maintain the artistic attitude. We must look, therefore, 
beyond art to find a more effectual remedy.<p>

<i>Sympathy</i> differs from art in this, that it is permanent and may 
be universal. Misery, as we have seen, arises from the egoistic impulse 
to preserve one's own existence at the expense of the well-being of 
others. Now sympathy leads us to look upon the sufferings of others as 
our sufferings; it implies the oneness of all nature, the disappearance 
of the concept of individuality, which is an illusion, and the 
<i>substitution of the will-to-let-live for the will-to-live</i>. It 
is, therefore, the ground phenomenon of ethics. Yet even sympathy can 
only alleviate suffering; in order wholly to destroy and remove the 
source of pain, man must negate the will-to-live, which is the origin 
of suffering.<p>

<i>Negation of the Will-to-live</i>. Schopenhauer finds both in 
Christian asceticism and in Buddhism examples of men in whom 
 <!--
EDUARD VON HARTMANN 591 
 --><A NAME="p591"></a>
 the <i>will-to-live is completely eradicated</i>, men who are utterly 
indifferent to self-preservation and the preservation of the race. This 
is the ideal of quiescence which the philosopher should strive to 
attain, the nirvana in which passion and desire and conflict and 
suffering disappear, to give place to perfect peace.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Schopenhauer's philosophy is lacking in 
systematic cohesiveness. His theory of knowledge, his <i>panthelism</i> 
(identity of will with reality), his pessimism, and his doctrine of 
deliverance from suffering are not articulated into a rational system. 
Perhaps the failure to furnish a complete and consistent rational 
scheme was pardonable in one who insisted so emphatically on the 
irrational nature of reality. Indeed, it is almost impossible in this 
instance to separate the philosophy from the philosopher, so deeply do 
the doctrines of Schopenhauer bear the impress of the character of the 
man. His doctrines are, however, of extrinsic importance as reflecting 
the sentiments of an age grown weary of life and surfeited with 
rationalism and idealism. For pessimism is an index of inferior 
vitality rather than of superior spiritual insight, and the insistence 
on the nonrational nature of reality is a symptom of a malady which may 
be traced to an overdose of transcendental metaphysics.<p>

<b>Eduard von Hartmann</b>, born at Berlin in 1842, is the most 
original of Schopenhauer's disciples, and is regarded as the greatest 
living exponent of modified voluntarism and mitigated pessimism. His 
system, which was first expounded in the <i>Philosophie des 
Unbewussten</i> (1869),<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> and since then has been developed and 
defended in several important treatises, may be described as a 
philosophy of the unconscious. Hartmann, inspired with the idea of 
reconciling Schopenhauer with Hegel, tries to unite the panthelism of 
the former with the evolutionary idealism of the latter. The ground of 
reality, the absolute, is, he teaches, the unconscious, which is not an 
irrational will, but a will acting as if it were intelligent. The will, 
guided by ideas, acts with a 
 <!--
592 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p592"></a>
 knowledge of its actions; but since it does not know that it knows, it 
is unconscious. Hartmann modifies Schopenhauer's pessimism by teaching 
not only that the individual is freed from the misery of life by 
attaining the negation of the will-to-live, but that the whole universe 
is moving by an evolutionary process towards a universal redemption 
from evil by means of a universal denial of will.<p>
