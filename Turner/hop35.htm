Mysticism may mean a tendency of the mind towards the supernatural, or 
it may mean a science growing out of such a tendency, -- a body of 
doctrine having for its object to determine the mode or manner in which 
the soul of man is directly united with God in contemplation and love. 
Mysticism, <i>as a tendency</i>, was a characteristic of Neo-Platonism; 
it reappeared in the philosophy of the Gnostics and in that of Erigena. 
In  
 <!--

 fact, wherever philosophy tended toward pantheism it tended towards 
mysticism. Thus we find the mystic spirit in the pantheistic systems 
with which the history of the philosophy of the twelfth century 
closes. Mysticism, as a science, does not appear in systematized form 
until the first part of the twelfth century, although the principles of 
orthodox mysticism are contained in the ascetic and exegetical 
treatises of the Fathers. When, as we have seen, William of Champeaux 
left Paris (i io8), he retired to the abbey of St. Victor and there 
continued to teach. It was out of this teaching that the mystic 
movement grew, which during the remainder of the century flourished at 
that abbey and with which are associated the Victorines, -- Hugh, 
Walter, and Richard. The condemnation of Abelard and the suspicion of 
heterodoxy incurred by Gilbert strengthened the cause of the mystics, 
who, from the outset, were opposed to dialectic.<p>

<b>St. Bernard of Clairvaux</b>, <i>Doctor Mellifluus</i> (1091-1153), 
although he belonged to no school of philosophy, lent all the weight of 
his authority to the cause of mysticism. He was himself an exponent of 
the principles of mystic theology, teaching that profane science is not 
to be studied except in so far as it may contribute to the cultivation 
of the spiritual life. The end and aim of life should be to attain by 
means of the twelve stages or degrees of humility a contemplative love 
of God.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

HUGH OF ST. VICTOR<p>

<b>Life</b>. Hugh of St. Victor was born at Hartingam in Saxony. From 
1125 until his death in 1141 he taught at the abbey of St. Victor. He 
is regarded as the founder of the Victorine school.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The mystical works of Hugh include <i>De Arca Noe Morali, 
De Arca Noe Mystica, De Vanitate Mundi, De Arrha Animae, De Amore  
 <!--

 Sponsi ad Sponsam</i>. These are published by Migne, <i>Patr. 
Lat.</i>, Vols. CLXXV-CLXXVII. A special work dealing with the 
philosophy of the Victorines is Mignon's <i>Origines de la 
scolastique</i>, etc. (Paris, 1895).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Hugh taught that the contemplation of invisible essences and causes is 
the true complement of philosophy. "Sapientes hujus mundi propterea 
stulti facti sunt quia soli naturali documento incedentes, exemplaria 
gratiae non habuerunt."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> Reason cannot penetrate to the truths of the 
natural order unless aided by God: "Ratio per se non sufficit, nisi a 
Deo adjuta fuerit." All knowledge is but the preliminary to the mystic 
life which leads to God. In this mystic life we must distinguish the 
<i>preparative stage</i> in which the soul engages in soliloquy, etc., 
<i>thought 
(cogitatio)</i>, by which the soul seeks God in the material world, 
<i>meditation (meditatio)</i>, by which the soul seeks God in the 
interior of the soul itself, and <i>contemplation (contemplatio)</i>, 
by which the soul is united immediately with God in supernatural 
intuition.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Richard of St. Victor</b>, who succeeded Hugh as prior of St. 
Victor, taught from 1162 to 1173. Under his influence the mystic 
movement took up a position of more determined hostility to secular 
learning. The knowledge, Richard declared, of which profane philosophy 
boasts is nothing but error and vanity: "Suspecta est mihi omnis 
veritas quam non confirmat Scripturae auctoritas."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> He observes with 
pleasure, "Multi qui prius fabricabant in officina Aristotelis . . . 
discunt cudere in officina Salvatoris."<p> 

It was, however, <b>Walter of St. Victor</b>, successor of Richard, who 
carried the mystic disapproval of secular learning to the extent  
 <!--
THE MYSTIC SCHOOL 305
 --><A NAME="p305"></a>
 of characterizing dialectic as "the devil's art." He wrote a work 
entitled <i>In Quatuor Labyrinthos Franciae</i>, in which Abelard, 
Peter of Lombardy, Peter of Poitiers, and Gilbert de la Porr&eacute;e 
(the "four labyrinths") were denounced as heretics because they had 
treated with "Scholastic levity" the mysteries of the Trinity and the 
Incarnation. To the same school belonged <b>Achard</b> and 
<b>Godfrey</b> of St. Victor.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The mystic school is justly considered to 
be a reaction against the rationalism of Berengar, Roscelin, and 
Abelard. The Victorines were at first willing to assign to human reason 
its legitimate scope in philosophy and theology; later, however, they 
made common cause with the <i>Cornificians</i> and opposed all profane 
learning, thus running counter to the Scholastic movement. Among those 
whom they condemned for using dialectical reasoning was Peter of 
Lombardy, the intellectual precursor of the greatest of the schoolmen 
of the Golden Age of Scholasticism.<p>

Mysticism has, nevertheless, a recognized place in the history of the 
Scholastic movement it represents an important phase of the Neo-Latin 
civilization of which Scholasticism is a product. To the <i>Credo ut 
intelligam</i> and the <i>Intelligo ut credam</i>, the mystics added a 
third principle, <i>Amo ut intelligam</i>, -- a principle which should 
not be neglected in a complete synthesis of the spiritual and emotional 
elements of human life, especially if human life be viewed, as it was 
viewed in the Middle Ages, in relation to the other world as well as to 
this.<p>

Mysticism was necessarily imaginative rather than rational. The
 Neo-Platonic concept of the world harmonized the elements of mysticism 
better than the Aristotelian concept could have done. It is these 
elements -- imaginativeness and Neo-Platonism -- that determine the 
tendency of mysticism towards pantheism.<p>
