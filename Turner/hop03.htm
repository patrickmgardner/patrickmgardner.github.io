THE ELEATIC SCHOOL</h3><p>

The members of this school were concerned not so much with the origin 
of things as with the principles of the world of things as it now is. 
Their inquiries centered round the problem of change, and in their 
solution of this problem they introduced the notions of Being and 
Becoming, thus carrying speculation into regions strictly metaphysical. 
The chief representatives of the school are <b>Xenophanes</b> the 
theologian, <b>Parmenides</b> the metaphysician, <b>Zeno</b> the 
dialectician, and <b>Melissus</b>, who shows a tendency to return to 
the views of the Earlier Ionian students of nature.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The work entitled <i>Concerning the Opinions</i>, or 
<i>Concerning Xenphanes, Zeno, and Gorgias</i>, which contains an 
account of the doctrines of Xenophanes, Zeno, and others, and which was 
at one time included among Aristotle's works, is now known to have been 
written neither by Aristotle nor by Theophrastus, but by a later writer 
of the Aristotelian school.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Our knowledge of the Eleatic philosophy 
is derived from some fragments of the writings of the Eleatics 
themselves, from Aristotle's account of them in his <i>Metaphysics</i>, 
and from the works of Simplicius, who had access to a more complete 
Eleatic literature than we now possess.  
 <!--
THE ELEATIC SCHOOL 45  
 --><A NAME="p45"></a><p>

XENOPHANES<p>

<b>Life</b>. Xenophanes was born at Colophon, in Asia Minor, about the 
year 570 B.C. According to Theophrastus, he was a disciple of 
Anaximander. After wandering through Greece as a rhapsodist, he 
settled at Elea in southern Italy; from this city is derived the name 
of the school which he founded. The date of his death is unknown.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. It is important to distinguish here (1) the fragments 
of Xenophanes' didactic poem, and (2) the accounts given by our 
secondary authorities. In the former we find merely a set of 
theological opinions; in the latter Xenophanes is represented as 
holding certain views on general metaphysical problems.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

In his Didactic Poem Xenophanes opposes to the polytheistic belief of 
the time the doctrine of the unity, eternity, unchangeableness, 
sublimity, and spirituality of God. With the enthusiasm and fine frenzy 
of a prophet, he inveighs against the notions commonly held concerning 
the gods. "Each man," he says, "represents the gods as he himself is: 
the negro as black and flat-nosed, the Thracian as red-haired and
 blue-eyed; and if horses and oxen could paint, they, no doubt, would 
depict the gods as horses and oxen" (frag. 6). So, also, he continues, 
men ascribe to the gods mental characteristics which are human; they do 
not understand that God is "all eye, all ear, all intellect."<p>

According to our Authorities, -- and we have no right to challenge 
their unanimous verdict in this matter, -- all that is said in the 
sacred poem of Xenophanes is to be referred to the unity and eternity 
of the totality of being. Plato<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> and Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> describe Xenophanes as 
teaching the unity of all things. If this pantheism appears to us to be 
irreconcilable with the monotheism of the poem, we must not conclude 
that the contradiction was apparent to Xenophanes, who, though he 
could 
 <!--
46 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p46"></a>
 rise above the popular concept of the gods, could not wholly free 
himself from the notion, so deeply rooted in the Greek mind, that 
nature is imbued with the divine.<p>

1. In his metaphysical inquiry Xenophanes seems, according to the 
pseudo-Aristotelian treatise above mentioned, to have started with the 
principle that "Nothing comes from nothing," whence he concluded that 
there is no Becoming. Now, plurality depends on Becoming; if, then, 
there is no Becoming, there is no plurality: "All is one, and one is 
all." The authority, however, of this portion of the treatise is 
doubtful, though it may with safety be said that if Xenophanes did not 
develop this line of reasoning as Parmenides his disciple afterwards 
did, the premises of these conclusions are implicitly contained in the 
theological poem. For the same reason, it is uncertain whether 
Xenophanes maintained the infinity or the finite nature of the Deity, 
or whether he endowed the Deity with a certain spherical shape.<p>

2. In physics, Xenophanes, in common with others of his school, forgets 
the unity of being which, as a metaphysician, he had established, and 
proceeds to an investigation of the plurality which he had denied. He 
advocates empirical knowledge, though he holds it to be unworthy of 
entire confidence, teaching (frag. 16) that truth is to be discovered 
by degrees. According to some of our authorities he held that the 
<i>primitive substance</i> was earth; according to others he held that 
it was water and earth. A few attribute to him the doctrine of four 
primitive elements. There is better foundation for the opinion that he 
supposed the earth to have passed from a fluid to its present solid 
condition,<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> basing his belief, according to Hippolytus, on the fact 
that petrified marine animals are found on land and even on mountains. 
Thus, although the one total is eternal, the world in its present form 
is not eternal.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Xenophanes' system is, so far, the boldest 
attempt to synthesize the phenomena of the universe. In 
 <!--
PARMENIDES 47 
 --><A NAME="p47"></a>
 fact, it is one instance among many in which the desire to find the 
one in the manifold -- a desire which is the inspiration of all 
philosophical speculation -- is carried to the excess of monism. For, 
if we are to accept any theory that will reconcile Xenophanes' 
metaphysics with his theology, we must hold that he identified nature, 
the one, immutable, eternal, with God, who likewise possesses these 
attributes.<p>

PARMENIDES<p>

<b>Life</b>. Parmenides, who was, perhaps, the greatest of all the
 pre-Socratic philosophers, was born at Elea about 540 B.C. According 
to Aristotle, he was a disciple of Xenophanes, whose doctrines he took 
up and carried to their idealistic consequences. He had a more definite 
grasp of principles than Xenophanes had, and developed them with 
greater thoroughness than his master had done.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The didactic poem <b>peri phuse&ocirc;s</b>, composed 
by Parmenides and preserved by Sextus, Proclus, and others, consists of 
three parts. The first is a sublimely conceived introduction, in which 
the goddess of truth points out to the philosopher two paths of 
knowledge, the one leading to a knowledge of truth, the other to a 
knowledge of the opinions of men. The second part of the poem describes 
the journey to truth, and contains the metaphysical doctrines of the 
author. The third part, dealing with the opinions of men, contains a 
hypothetical physics, a cosmology of the apparent.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Metaphysical Doctrines</b>. Truth consists in the knowledge that 
Being is, and that not-Being can neither exist nor be conceived to 
exist. The greatest error lies in treating Being and not-Being as the 
same.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> From this fundamental error arise the opinions of men. Truth 
lies in thought, for "nothing can be but what can be thought." The 
senses lead to error. Being, therefore, is, and since not-Being is not, 
Being is one. It is consequently unchangeable and unproduced, despite 
the testimony 
 <!--
48 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p48"></a>
 of the senses to the contrary. For how could Being be produced? Either 
from not-Being, which does not exist, or from Being, in which case it 
was before it began to be. Therefore it is unproduced, unchangeable, 
undivided, whole, homogeneous, equally balanced on all sides, like a 
perfect sphere.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup><p>

From the comparison of Being to a sphere it appears that Being is not 
incorporeal.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> Ideas do not appear in philosophy <i>ex abrupto</i>. 
They are gradually developed in the course of speculation. Thus, 
Parmenides' idea of reality is not that of the Ionians, who spoke of a 
crude material substratum of existence. Neither is it the highly 
abstract notion of Being which we find in the philosophy of Plato and 
Aristotle. It is a something intermediate between these extremes, and 
is by some likened to our notion of space.<p>

<b>Physical Doctrines</b>. Though right reason (<b>logos</b>) maintains 
that Being is one and immutable, the senses and common opinion 
(<b>doxa</b>) are convinced of the plurality and change which 
apparently exist around us. Placing himself, therefore, at this point 
of view, Parmenides proceeds<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> to give us<p>

1. <i>A cosmology of the apparent</i>. Here he is evidently influenced 
by the Pythagorean doctrine of opposites. He maintains that all things 
are composed of light, or warmth, and darkness, or cold; of these, the 
former, according to Aristotle,<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> corresponds to Being, the latter to 
not-Being. They are united by a <i>Deity</i> (<i>daim&ocirc;n, he panta 
kuberna</i>). They are symbolically described as male and female, and 
their union is said to be effected by Eros, the first creation of the 
Deity.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup><p>

2. <i>An anthropology of the apparent</i>. The life of the soul, 
perception and reflection, depend on the blending of the lightwarm and 
the dark-cold principles, each principle standing, as we should say, in 
psychical relation to a corresponding principle in the physical world. 
 <!--
ZENO OF ELEA 49 
 --><A NAME="p49"></a><p>

In his cosmology, as well as in his anthropology, Parmenides did not 
abandon the metaphysical doctrine that Being is one and that change is 
an illusion. The views just described are those which Parmenides would 
have held had he believed in plurality and change.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Parmenides is the first Greek philosopher 
to place reason in opposition to opinion. Though he makes no attempt at 
determining the conditions of knowledge, he prepares the way for 
subsequent thinkers and formulates the problem which Socrates was to 
solve by his doctrine of concepts.<p>

The doctrine of the unity of Being could not be further developed. It 
was left for Zeno, the disciple of Parmenides, to give a more thorough 
dialectical demonstration of the monistic idea.<p>

ZENO OF ELEA<p>

<b>Life</b>. Zeno of Elea, born about 490 B.C., was, according to 
Plato,<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> the favorite pupil of Parmenides. He defended the doctrines 
of his master, and showed, by the use of dialectics, the absurdity of 
common opinion.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Plato speaks of a work (apparently the only work) of 
Zeno, which was a polemic against the common view that plurality and 
change are realities. It consisted of several discourses 
(<b>logoi</b>), in each of which were <b>hupotheseis</b> or 
suppositions, made with the intention of reducing them <i>ad 
absurdum</i>. The method is, therefore, indirect, and it is because of 
the skill with which Zeno applied this method that Aristotle, if we are 
to believe Diogenes and Sextus, regarded him as the <i>founder of 
dialectic</i>.<p>

The work, with the exception of a few extracts preserved by Simplicius, 
is lost. We are obliged, consequently, to rely almost entirely on 
secondary sources. Chief among these is the <i>Physics</i> of 
Aristotle, in which we find Zeno's arguments against the reality of 
motion.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

The <b>Arguments against Motion</b> are as follows. <i>First 
argument</i> : A body, in order to move from one point to another, must 
move tbrough an infinite number of spaces; for magnitude 
 <!--
50 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p50"></a>
 is divisible <i>ad infinitum</i>. But the infinite cannot be 
traversed; therefore motion is impossible. <i>Second argument</i>: The 
problem of Achilles and the tortoise. <i>Third argument</i>: A body 
which is in one place is certainly at rest. Now, the arrow in its 
flight is at each successive moment in one place; therefore it is at 
rest. <i>Fourth argument</i>: This is based on the fact that two bodies 
of equal size move past each other twice as fast (if they move with 
equal velocities in opposite directions) as one would move past the 
other if this latter were stationary. Motion, therefore, is an 
illusion, because one of its fundamental laws -- that bodies with 
equal velocities traverse a certain space in equal times -- is not 
true.<p>

Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> meets these arguments by defining the true nature of time, 
and by pointing out the difference between actual and potential 
infinity.<p>

Similarly, Zeno, according to our secondary sources, argued <b>against 
Plurality and Space</b>. (1) Zeno argued directly against the 
<i>testimony of the senses</i>: If a measure of corn produces a sound, 
each grain ought to produce a sound.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup> (2) Against <i>space</i>: if 
Being exists in space, space itself must exist in space, and so <i>ad 
infinitum</i>. This argument is contained in one of the extracts 
preserved by Simplicius. (3) If the <i>manifold</i> exists, it must be 
at once infinitely great and infinitesimally small, because it has an 
infinitude of parts which are indivisible. Therefore the existence of 
the manifold involves a contradiction.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Zeno's contribution to the philosophy of 
the Eleatic school consists in what must have been considered an 
irrefutable indirect proof of the twofold principle on which the school 
was founded, namely, that Being is one and that change is an illusion. 
 <!--
MELISSUS 51  
 --><A NAME="p51"></a><p>

MELISSUS<p>

<b>Life</b>. Melissus was, according to Diogenes Laertius, a native of 
Samos. We have no reason for doubting that he was, as Plutarch says, 
the commander of the Samian fleet which defeated the Athenians off the 
coast of Samos in the year 442 B.C.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> He was, therefore, a younger 
contemporary of Zeno, and it is possible that, like Zeno, he was a 
pupil of Parmenides. He wrote a work, <b>peri tou ontos</b> or <b>peri 
phuse&ocirc;s</b>.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Of the work just mentioned, Simplicius has preserved 
some fragments. These fragments agree with the accounts given of the 
doctrines of Melissus in the first part of the pseudo-Aristotelian 
treatise Concerning Xenophanes, etc.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Method</b>. Melissus undertook, as Zeno had done, to defend the 
doctrines of Parmenides. But while Zeno's method of argumentation was 
indirect, Melissus employed the direct method. He took up the 
principles of the Ionians and tried to show points of union between the 
Ionian and Eleatic schools.<p>

<b>Metaphysical Doctrine</b>. All that we know of Melissus' doctrine 
concerning Being may be summed up in the four propositions: (1) Being 
is eternal; (2) Being is infinite; (3) Being is one; (4) Being is 
unchangeable. His metaphysical doctrine is, therefore, identical with 
that of Parmenides, save in one respect. Parmenides did not pronounce 
Being infinite, while according to Melissus infinity is one of the 
attributes of Being. But, as appears from frag. 5, Melissus must not be 
understood to maintain the true infinity of Being. Evidently he had in 
mind infinite magnitude. Again, when he says<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> <b>s&ocirc;ma m&ecirc; 
echei</b>, we must not imagine that Melissus had attained a precise 
notion of the incorporeal. His metaphysics was a blending of the Ionian 
with the Eleatic doctrines, and we may suppose that there were many 
points of contradiction.<p>

The <b>Physical Doctrines</b> attributed to Melissus by Stobaeus and 
Philoponus cannot safely be said to have been held by him. 
 <!--
52 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p52"></a><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Melissus does not represent a development 
of Eleatic philosophy. His task was one of synthesis, or 
reconciliation, and in accomplishing this task he did not wholly escape 
the danger to which such an undertaking is always exposed: he admitted 
into Eleatic doctrines notions and definitions which were antagonistic 
to Eleatic principles.<p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. With Melissus the Eleatic school ends. What was left 
of Eleaticism drifted into Sophism, for which Zeno had prepared the way 
by his abuse of dialectical reasoning. But, though the school 
disappeared, its influence continued, and may be traced through 
Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, and the Atomists down to Plato and Aristotle. 
The Eleatics were the first to formulate the problems of Being and 
Becoming -- problems which are always the center of metaphysical 
speculation. These were the problems that Plato and Aristotle were to 
solve by the theory of Ideas and the doctrine of matter and form.<p>

Pre-Socratic philosophy is throughout objective in spirit and aim; it 
is a philosophy of nature. To this, Eleatic philosophy forms no 
exception. It is true that the Eleatics give to physics merely a 
hynothetical value, and that they decry sense-received knowledge, 
contrasting it with reason. Yet on closer examination it will be seen 
that all their inquiry is concerned with the origin and explanation of 
nature, and that the Being which they maintain to be the only reality 
is a something extended in space, or, as Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> describes it, the 
substrate of sensible things. Zeno, indeed, introduced dialectic into 
philosophy, but he treated it merely as an instrument of proof, 
unaccompanied by any inquiry into the nature and conditions of 
knowledge. The founder of the philosophy of the concept is Socrates, 
and Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> is right when he looks for the germ of Socratic 
philosophy, not in the Eleatic doctrine, but in the teachings of 
Democritus and the Pythagoreans.<p>
