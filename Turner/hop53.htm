SYSTEMS OF POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY</h3><p>

The growing sense of political individuality and the gradual dwindling 
of the ideal of a universal Christian empire were most important 
factors in the change from ancient to modern modes of thought. Dante's 
<i>De Monarchia</i> no longer embodied the political aspirations of 
European states. Humanism, moreover, had restored ancient ideals of 
political life, and the result was an attempt on the part of some 
Renaissance writers to formulate systems of political philosophy which 
should meet the conditions of the times.<p>

The first independent political philosopher of this period was 
<b>Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli</b> (1469-1527). In the celebrated work 
entitled <i>Il Principe</i> and in his other writings Machiavelli 
expounds a system of state utilitarianism. He teaches that, in the 
government of the state, means are to be judged exclusively with 
reference to the end for which they are employed, without 
consideration, or at least without due consideration, of the relation 
which they bear to the principles of morality. "Where it is a question 
of saving one's country," he writes, "there must be no 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p442"></a>
 hesitation on the score of justice or injustice, cruelty or kindness, 
praise or blame, but, setting all things else aside, one must snatch 
whatever means present themselves for the preservation of life and 
liberty."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Machiavelli waged war on the Christian religion, contending 
that Christianity is opposed to the true advancement of the state, and 
that it is inferior to the religion of ancient Rome, inasmuch as it 
fails to inculcate the political virtues. His ideal of a ruler is that 
of one who should combine the qualities of the fox with those of the 
lion. The ruler should make himself liked if he can; if he cannot, he 
must make himself feared: he should maintain the outward semblance of 
honesty and morality even when, for reasons of state, he is obliged to 
set the principles of honesty and morality aside.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Thomas More</b> (1478-1535) and <b>Jean Bodin</b> (1530-1596), 
inspired by a spirit altogether different from that which animated 
Machiavelli, developed from Platonic principles highly ideal schemes of 
state organization and government. More (Blessed Thomas More, as he is 
now entitled to be called) was educated at Oxford, and after some years 
of very successful practice at law entered into political life, 
becoming successively Speaker of the House of Commons, treasurer to the 
exchequer, and lord chancellor. Having incurred the displeasure of 
Henry VIII, he was committed to the Tower, and after eighteen months' 
imprisonment was executed on the charge of attempting to deprive the 
king of the title of Supreme Head of the Church in England. In his 
<i>Utopia (De Optimo Reipublicae Statu deque Nova Insula Utopia)</i> he 
describes an imaginary republic so governed as to secure universal 
happiness. Bodin is more scientific in his method than any of the other 
political philosophers of this period. He may be said to have 
inaugurated the historical method of studying political philosophy.

THOMAS HOBBES 443

THOMAS HOBBES<p>

<b>Life</b>. Thomas Hobbes was born at Westport, now in Malmesbury in 
Wiltshire, in 1588. He was educated at Oxford, and during his repeated 
sojourns at Paris he became acquainted with Gassendi, Mersenne, and 
Descartes, who had a marked influence on his system of speculative 
philosophy. His political doctrines were influenced, no doubt, by the 
disorders of the English Revolution. He died in 1679. His principal 
works are <i>Leviathan, sive de Materia, Forma et Potestate Civitatis 
Ecclesiasticae et Civilis</i>, and <i>Elementa Philosophiae</i> 
including three parts: <i>De Corpore, De Homine</i>, and <i>De 
Cive</i>.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Hobbes, like Bacon, concerned himself chiefly with the practical aspect 
of philosophy; but instead of applying philosophical principles to 
technical inventions, as his fellow-countryman had attempted to do, he 
addressed himself to the task of applying philosophy to the <i>solution 
of political questions</i>. We shall study, therefore, first the 
speculative and secondly the political doctrines of Hobbes.<p>

<b>1. Speculative Philosophy</b>. Hobbes is the first in a long line of 
English nominalists and sensists. <i>The only universality</i> which he 
admits is <i>that of the name</i>. The name is a sign taken at pleasure 
to designate a plurality of objects. It is for us to decide what 
objects a name shall designate, and the announcement of such a decision 
is what we call a definition. In this connection he remarks that "Words 
are wise men's counters; they do but reckon by them: but they are the 
money of fools."<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 444

<i>Reality is not only individual, it is also corporeal</i>. All that 
exists is body, all that occurs is motion. Spiritual substance can 
neither be nor be thought. Neither is there in human knowledge any 
element superior to sense. "The original of them all," he says, 
speaking of men's thoughts, "is that which we call sense, for there is 
no conception in a man's mind which hath not at first, totally or by 
parts, been begotten upon the organs of sense." From the foregoing 
principles Hobbes is led to affirm the doctrine of <i>subjectivism</i>. 
"I shall endeavor," he writes, "to make plain these points: that the 
object wherein color and images are inherent is not the object or thing 
seen: that there is nothing without us (really) which we call image or 
color: that the said image or color is but the apparition unto us of 
the motion, agitation, or alteration which the object worketh in the 
brain or spirits or some internal substance of the head."<p>

<b>2. Political Philosophy</b>. Hobbes begins by denying the doctrine 
on which Aristotle's philosophy of the state is based, the doctrine, 
namely, that man is a political animal. The English philosopher assumes 
rather the Epicurean principle that originally there existed a 
condition of <i>natural warfare among men -- homo homini lupus</i>, or 
<i>bellum omnium contra omnes</i>. But, he goes on to say, when men 
discovered the disadvantages of continual strife, and realized that the 
safety of life and property is a condition essential to progress, they 
entered into a compact, by which it was stipulated that the individual 
should vest all his rights in the supreme and absolute authority of the 
state. The authority of the state has its origin, therefore, in a 
social compact, and since the renunciation and transference of private 
rights was complete and unreserved, the authority of the state is 
absolute. Hobbes carries the doctrine of state absolutism to the 
extreme of subjecting even conscience and religion to the authority of 
the ruler. He teaches that the will of the ruler is the supreme arbiter 
of right and wrong in the moral order and of true and false in the 
matter of religious belief.  A 
 <!--

 --><A NAME="p445"></a><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. It would be difficult to overestimate the 
influence of Hobbes on the subsequent development of philosophic 
thought in England. Despite the wise maxim quoted above, philosophers 
have too often used words as money rather than as counters, and all the 
confusion arising from the use of vague and inaccurate terminology -- a 
confusion which is, to the present day, the bane of English 
philosophy -- may be traced, in large measure, to Hobbes. For him, 
substance and body, imagination and intellect are synonymous, and if 
these terms are confounded by subsequent writers, upon Hobbes must be 
laid the chief part of the blame.<p>

The causes which led to the study of political philosophy during the 
transition period led also to the study of the philosophy of law. The 
Italian <b>Alberico Gentili</b> (1552-1608) paid special attention to 
the study of the law of war. The German <b>Althus</b> (1557-1638) 
devoted himself to the study of Roman law. To these succeeded the 
Netherlander <b>Hugo Grotius</b> (Hugo de Groot) (1583-1645), who in 
defending the rights of his country to free trade with the Indies 
developed a system of philosophy of natural law. His most celebrated 
work is entitled <i>De Jure Belli et Pacis</i> (1625). He maintains the 
doctrine of social contract, but while Hobbes regards the transference 
of the rights of the individual to the state as irrevocable, Grotius 
considers that rights once transferred may afterwards be recalled. He 
favors the separation of Church and State, and advocates religious 
toleration. By the phrase <i>jus gentium</i> he does not mean natural 
law but rather positive international law, or the law regulating the 
relations of one state with another.<p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. The period of transition from mediaeval to modern 
philosophy was a period of tendencies rather than of systems. It was an 
age of new ideas, and of changes in the world of letters, science, 
politics, and religion. It witnessed the disappearance of the old order 
and the advent of the new. During this period of change, the 
Aristotelian and Scholastic idea of a 
 <!--
446 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p446"></a>
 geocentric universe gave way to the modern scientific notion of a 
heliocentric system; the mediaeval ideal of a universal Christian 
empire gave way to the modern ideals of individual national life; and 
in many European states the spirit of ecclesiastical unity disappeared, 
to be replaced by the notion of national church organization and the 
assertion of individualism in matters of religious belief. Thus did the 
Renaissance period usher in the modern era. It did not itself 
contribute any permanent system of philosophy. To systematize in a 
speculative scheme of thought the wealth of ideas, facts, and 
tendencies resulting from the great intellectual movements of the 
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, was the task which the Renaissance 
set and which the seventeenth century undertook to accomplish.<p>
