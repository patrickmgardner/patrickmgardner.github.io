<h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXI<br>
PAN-PHENOMENALISM -- HUME</h3><p>

So far the history of the philosophy of the eighteenth century has been 
the story of the empirical attempt to solve the Cartesian problem by 
reducing mind to matter, and of the idealistic attempt to solve the 
same problem by reducing matter to mind. There remains one more phase 
of eighteenth century speculation, namely, Hume's answer to the 
Cartesian problem, if indeed it may be called an answer, since it is 
rather a denial of the reason for proposing such a problem at all. For, 
instead of trying to untie what may be called the Gordian knot of 
post-Cartesian speculation, Hume cut the knot by denying the substantial 
existence of mind and matter.<p>

HUME<p>

<b>Life</b>. David Hume was born at Edinburgh in 1711. After an 
unsuccessful attempt to fit himself for the profession of law, he 
decided to take up the study of philosophy and literature. During the 
years 1734 to 1737, which he spent in France, he wrote his <i>Treatise 
on Human Nature</i>. The work, he says, "fell dead-born from the press, 
without reaching such distinction as even to excite a murmur among the 
zealots." Later, he recast the first book of the Treatise into his 
<i>Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</i>, the second book into his 
<i>Dissertation on the Passions</i>, and the third into his <i>Enquiry 
concerning the Principles of Morals</i>. His <i>Essays, Moral, 
Political, and Literary</i>, which were published at Edinburgh in 1742, 
met a favorable reception. In 1747 he accompanied a military embassy to 
the courts of Vienna and Turin, and again in 1763 he accompanied the 
English ambassador to the court of Versailles, where he remained until 
1766. During the interval he had held the office of keeper of the 
Advocates' Library at Edinburgh, and had begun the publication of his 
<i>History of England</i>. In 1767 he was made under-secretary of state 
in the Foreign Office. In 1769 he returned to Edinburgh, and died there 
in 1776.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. In addition to the works already mentioned Hume wrote a 
<i>Natural History of Religion</i> and <i>Dialogues concerning Natural 
Religion</i>.

HUME's ANALYSIS OF MIND 519 
 --><A NAME="p519"></a>
 The standard edition of flume's philosophical works is that of Green 
and Grosse, 4 vols., London, 1874, reprinted 1889-1890. The student may 
be referred to Huxley's <i>Hume</i> (<i>English Men of Letters</i> 
series, 1879), to Knight's <i>Hume</i> (<i>Blackwood's Philosophical 
Classics</i>, 1886), and to the <i>Introduction</i> to Green and 
Grosse's edition of Hume's <i>Works</i>.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Starting Point</b>. Hume's starting point is that of the empiricist, 
and his conception of the method of philosophical procedure is that of 
the critical philosopher. In the Introduction to the <i>Treatise on 
Human Nature</i> he writes, "To me it seems evident that, the essence 
of the mind being equally unknown to us with that of external bodies, 
it must be equally impossible to form any notion of its powers and 
qualities otherwise than from careful and exact experiments . . . it is 
certain we cannot go beyond experience."<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> The critical element 
appears when, in this same Introduction and in the opening paragraphs 
of the <i>Enquiry concerning Human Understanding</i>, he reduces all 
philosophy to the study of human nature, basing the study of human 
nature on the observation of mental phenomena and "an exact analysis of 
the powers and capacity" of the mind.<p>

<b>Analysis of Mind</b>. According to Hume, <i>the mind is its 
contents</i>. His analysis of the mind is, therefore, merely an 
inventory of the contents of the mind, or of <i>perceptions</i>. In 
Hume's philosophy, <i>perception</i> is synonymous with state of 
consciousness, the term being equivalent to the Cartesian 
<i>thought</i> and to the <i>idea</i> of Locke and Berkeley.<p>

Hume divides perceptions into two classes: <i>impressions</i>, which 
are defined as the more lively perceptions experienced when we hear, 
see, will, love, etc. (perceptions therefore, include passions and 
emotions as well as sensations), and <i>ideas or thoughts</i>, which 
are faint images of impressions.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> As to the innateness 
 <!--
520 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p520"></a>
 of impressions and ideas, Hume says that, if by <i>innate</i> we mean 
contemporary with our birth, the dispute seems to be frivolous; but if 
by <i>innate</i> we understand what is original or copied from no 
precedent perception, then we may assert that <i>all our impressions 
are innate and our ideas not innate</i>.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> When, therefore, Hume 
speaks of memory, imagination, ideas of relation, abstract ideas, etc., 
he is speaking of mental faculties and states which are ultimately 
reducible to 
 sense-faculties and to the impressions of the senses.<p>

What, then, are the objects of our impressions? Hume answers that we do 
not perceive substance nor qualities, but only our own subjective 
states. "'T is not our body we perceive when we regard our limbs and 
members, but certain impressions <i>which enter by the senses</i>. The 
last words seem to indicate a belief in an external cause of our 
impressions, and, indeed, Hume is not at all consistent in his 
subjectivism; for he admits, in at least one passage, the possibility 
of our impressions either arising from the object, or being produced by 
the creative power of the mind, or being derived from the Author of our 
being.<p>

The <i>denial of the substantiality of the mind</i> is Hume's most 
distinctive contribution to psychology. It is, he says, successive 
perceptions only that constitute the mind. The substantiality of the 
ego is a delusion; what we call mind is simply "a heap or collection of 
different perceptions united together by certain relations, and 
supposed, though falsely, to be endowed with simplicity and 
identity."<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> Thus did Hume complete the work of empiricism. Locke 
reasoned away everything except the primary qualities of bodies and the 
unknown substratum (substance) in which they adhere; Berkeley showed 
that even the substance and primary qualities of bodies might be 
reasoned away, and now Hume applies the same solvent to the substance 
of mind itself, and leaves nothing but phenomena. 
 <!--
HUME'S ANALYSIS OF CAUSATION 521  
 --><A NAME="p521"></a><p>

If the substantial nature of the ego is a delusion, <i>immortality is 
not a datum of reason</i>. We are not surprised, therefore, to find 
that in the essay <i>On the Immortality of the Soul</i>, Hume, after 
examining the arguments in favor of immortality, which arguments he 
divides into metaphysical, moral, and physical, concludes that "it is 
the gospel, and the gospel alone, that has brought life and immortality 
to light."<p>

<b>Analysis of Causation</b>. Quite in keeping with Hume's denial of 
substance is his analysis of causation into a succession of phenomena. 
All our ideas, he teaches, are connected either by resemblance, 
contiguity in time, contiguity in space, or causality. <i>Causality, 
then, is merely a relation between our ideas</i>; but is it an <i>a 
priori</i> relation, and if not, whence and how does it arise?<p>

The first of these questions Hume answers in the negative. He 
formulates the <i>principle of causality</i> as follows: Whatever event 
has a beginning must have a cause.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> He maintains that "the knowledge 
of this relation (causality) is not, in any instance, attained by 
reasonings <i>a priori</i>; but arises entirely from experience, when 
we find that any particular objects are <i>constantly conjoined</i> 
with each other.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> All distinct ideas are separable from each other, 
and, as the ideas of cause and effect are evidently distinct, 't will 
be easy for us to conceive any object as non-existent this moment, and 
existent the next, without conjoining to it the distinct idea of a 
cause or producing principle."<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> The argument, as Huxley remarks,<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> 
"is of the circular sort, for the major premise that all distinct ideas 
are separable in thought, assumes the question at issue."<p>

The axiom of causality, therefore, comes from experience. But, Hume 
observes, one instance does not constitute sufficient experimental 
evidence of the causal connection of two phenomena. When, however, 
"one particular series of events has  
 <!--
522 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
 --><A NAME="p522"></a>
 always, in all instances, been conjoined with another, we make no 
longer any scruple in foretelling one on the appearance of the other. . 
. . We then call the one <i>cause</i> and the other <i>effect</i>. We 
suppose that there is some connexion between them: some power in the 
one by virtue of which it infallibly produces the other. . . . But 
there is nothing in a number of instances different from every single 
instance which is supposed to be exactly similar, except only that 
after a repetition of similar instances the mind is <i>carried by 
habit</i>, upon the appearance of one event, to expect its usual 
attendant and to believe that it will exist."<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> There is, therefore, 
no real dependence of effect on cause, no <i>ontological nexus</i>, but 
merely a <i>psychological</i> one, an expectation arising from habit or 
custom.<p>

Hume, indeed, admits that, in addition to the notion of sequence of 
phenomena, there is in our concept of causality the idea of something 
resident in the cause -- <i>a power</i>, force, or energy -- which 
<i>produces</i> the effect. When, however, he comes to analyze this 
notion of power, he finds it to be merely a projection of the 
subjective feeling of effort into the phenomenon, which is the 
invariable antecedent. "No animal can put external bodies in motion 
without the sentiment of a nisus, or endeavor, and every animal has a 
sentiment or feeling from the stroke or blow of an external object that 
is in motion. . We consider only the constant experienced conjunction 
of the events, and as we <i>feel</i> the customary connection between 
the ideas, we <i>transfer</i> that feeling to the objects."<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup><p>

From the empirical viewpoint, Hume's analysis of the principle of 
causality is thorough. If there is in the mind no power superior to 
sensation and reflection, no faculty by which we are enabled to 
abstract from the contingent data of sense the necessary elements of 
intellectual thought, then all the axioms of science, the axiom of 
causality included, are mere associations of sense-impressions. But the 
empirical standpoint is erroneous; 
 <!--
HUME'S ETHICS  523
 --><A NAME="p523"></a>
 in this, as in other instances, empiricism stops where the real 
problem of philosophy begins, as is evident from the fact that, while 
Hume succeeds in showing <i>that</i> one event is connected with 
another in our past experience, neither he nor any other empiricist has 
shown <i>why</i> we are entitled to expect that events which have been 
connected in the past will be connected in the future. Empiricism can 
show a <i>connectio facti</i>, but it cannot show a <i>connectio 
juris</i>, between antecedent and consequent, between cause and effect.<p>

<b>Ethics</b>. Hume's ethical system is a development of the 
fundamental doctrine of the English ethical schools of the eighteenth 
century. He <i>restricts the r&ocirc;le of reason</i> as a moral 
criterion and develops the doctrine that moral distinctions are 
determined by our sense of the agreeable and the disagreeable. Abstract 
distinctions, mere rational intuitions or inferences, leave us 
perfectly indifferent as to action, so long as they fail to acquire an 
<i>emotional value</i> through some relation to the passions and 
ultimately to the feeling of the agreeableness or disagreeableness of 
the action to be performed. "Nothing but a sentiment can induce us to 
give the preference to the beneficial and useful tendencies over 
pernicious ones. This sentiment is, in short, nothing but 
<i>sympathy</i>."<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> The following is the ultimate analysis of moral 
value: "No man is absolutely indifferent to the happiness and misery of 
others. The first has a natural tendency to give pleasure; the second, 
pain. This every one may find in himself. It is not probable that these 
principles can be resolved into principles more simple and universal, 
whatever attempts may be made to that purpose."<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Hume's philosophy is summed up in the words 
<i>pan-phenomenalism</i> and <i>scepticism</i>. He reduced mind as well 
as matter to mere phenomena, and denied the ontological nexus between 
cause and effect. He maintained that there is no permanent, immutable 
element in the world of our experience, 
 <!--
524 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p524"></a>
 and that there is no valid principle which can justify metaphysical 
speculation concerning the world beyond our experience. It was this 
total subversion of the necessary and universal that awoke Kant from 
his dogmatic slumber, and gave rise in Scotland to the movement in 
favor of the philosophy of common sense.<p>

It will be necessary, before entering on the study of these reactions 
against Hume, to give a brief sketch of what is known as the German 
illumination -- the transition from Leibniz to Kant.<p>
