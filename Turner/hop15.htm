<h3 align="center">CHAPTER XV<br>
THE SCEPTICS</h3><p>

<b>Sources</b>. Pyrrho, the chief Sceptic of this period, left no 
writings. Of the writings of his earlier followers very few fragments 
have come down to us. We are obliged, therefore, to rely on 
<i>secondary sources</i>, such as <i>Diogenes Laertius, Aristocles</i> 
(quoted by Eusebius), and the <i>Later Sceptics</i>.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The Stoics and Epicureans laid down certain theoretical principles from 
which they deduced canons of conduct, always keeping in view the 
practical aim of philosophy, to make men happy. The Sceptics agreed 
with the Stoics and Epicureans in referring philosophy primarily to 
conduct and the pursuit of happiness, but, instead of laying down 
theoretical principles as the Stoics and Epicureans had done, they 
taught that the first step to happiness is to forego all theoretical 
inquiry and to disclaim all certainty of knowledge.<p>

The principal Sceptics are: (1) <b>Pyrrho</b>, (2) the <i>Platonists of 
the Middle Academy</i>, (3) <i>Later Sceptics</i>, including 
<b>AEnesidemus</b>.<p>

PYRRHO<p>

<b>Life</b>. Pyrrho of Elis was a contemporary of Aristotle. Very 
little is known about his life. It is probable that he died about the 
year 270 B.C. Among his disciples <b>Timon of Phlius</b>, surnamed the 
<i>sillographer</i>, is best known. Timon composed satirical poems 
(<b>silloi</b>) in which he attacked the dogmatists, following in this 
the example of his teacher, who declared that Democritus alone deserved 
the name of philosopher, and that all the rest, Plato and Aristotle 
included, were mere <i>Sophists</i>.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

In accounting for Pyrrho's Scepticism it is safe to add to the 
influence which Democritus may have exercised on his mind 
 <!--
THE SCEPTICS 185 
 --><A NAME="p185"></a>
 the influence of the Megarian spirit of criticism which must have 
prevailed in Pyrrho's native city.<p>

All we know about the teaching of Pyrrho may be reduced to the 
following propositions: (1) In themselves, real things are neither 
beautiful nor ugly, neither large nor small. We have as little right to 
say that they are the one as we have to say that they are the other. 
Hence the famous <b>ouden mallon</b>.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> (2) Real things are, 
therefore, inaccessible to human knowledge, and he is wise who, 
recognizing the futility of inquiry, abstains from judging. This 
attitude of mind was called <b>epoch&ecirc; aphasia</b>.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> (3) From 
this withholding of judgment arises the state of 
<i>imperturbability</i> (<b>ataraxia</b>) in which human happiness 
consists.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In this account of Pyrrhonism no attempt has been made to separate the 
doctrines of Pyrrho from those of Timon. Pyrrho taught orally, and the 
fact of his having left no writings accounts for the freedom with 
which writers attribute to him the principles and tenets of his 
followers.<p>

THE MIDDLE ACADEMY<p>

<b>Arcesilaus</b> and <b>Carneades</b>, departing from the tradition of 
the Platonic school, of which they were the official representatives, 
lent their aid to the Sceptical movement by seeking to establish on 
rational and empirical grounds the thesis that it is impossible to 
arrive at certitude.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> The Scepticism of the Middle Academy very quickly 
gave way before Eclecticism.<p>

THE LATER SCEPTICS<p>

Under this title are included <b>AEnesidemus</b> and others who were 
for the most part physicians, and who from sensualistic premises   
 <!--
186 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p186"></a>
 deduced a system of Scepticism which was more radical than the 
idealistic Scepticism or the probabilism of the Academy.<p>

<b>AEnesidemus</b> of Cnossus in Crete taught at Alexandria about the 
beginning of the Christian era. According to Ritter and Preller,<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> he 
flourished between the years 80 and 50 B.C. Diogenes<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> alludes to a 
work of AEnesidemus in which by means of ten <i>tropes</i> 
(<b>tropoi</b>) he strove to show that contradictory predicates may be 
affirmed of one and the same subject, and that, consequently, certain 
knowledge is impossible. These tropes are a fairly complete enumeration 
of the arguments of the Sceptics and furnished, directly or indirectly, 
material to more than one advocate of the relativity of knowledge in 
subsequent times.<p>

According to Sextus Empiricus,<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> AEnesidemus subjected the notion of 
<i>cause</i> to special analysis, and pronounced it to be
 self-contradictory. A cause, he argued, either precedes the effect, or 
is synchronous with it, or is subsequent to it. Now, it cannot precede 
the effect; if it did, it would be a cause before it was a cause. It 
cannot be synchronous with the effect, for in that case cause and 
effect would be interchangeable; there would be no reason why one 
rather than the other should be called the product. Finally, the 
hypothesis that the cause is subsequent to the effect is manifestly 
absurd. In this way did AEnesidemus conclude, sophistically, that 
<i>the notion of cause is utterly devoid of meaning</i>.<p>

AEnesidemus, however, did not regard Scepticism as a system, but only 
as an introduction (ag&ocirc;g&ecirc;) to a system of philosophy.<p>

<b>Agrippa</b>, who lived about a century after AEnesidemus, reduced 
the tropes to five, and argued that knowledge is impossible because, 
the major premise of the syllogism being itself a conclusion, 
syllogistic reasoning is a <i>regressus in infinitum</i>.<p>

<b>Sextus Empiricus</b>, who is the most important of the later 
Sceptics, lived at Alexandria about the year A.D. 300. In his work 
<i>Against the Mathematicians</i>, and in his treatise known as 
 <!--
THE ECLECTICS 187 
 --><A NAME="p187"></a>
 <i>Pyrrhonic Hypotyposes</i>, he subjects to critical examination the 
dogmatism not only of the great constructive systems of theoretical and 
practical philosophy but also of arithmetic and geometry. He maintains 
that no science is certain, or rather that the true Sceptic should 
refrain from any absolute judgment whatever.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The history of Greek Scepticism exhibits an 
interesting phase of the practical idea which dominated the philosophy 
of Greece during the third period. Like the Stoics and Epicureans, the 
Sceptics were animated with the desire to find in philosophy a refuge 
from the disheartening conditions of the times in which they lived; 
but, unlike their dogmatizing contemporaries, they believed that the 
first step towards securing happiness is the abdication of all claim to 
the attainment of scientific knowledge.<p>
