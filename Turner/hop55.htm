<h3 align="center">CHAPTER LV<br>
CARTESIANISM</h3><p>

Toward the end of the seventeenth century almost every French writer of 
note evinced a more or less decided tendency towards Cartesianism. 
<b>Bossuet</b> (1627-1704) and <b>F&eacute;nelon</b> (1651-1715) 
presented the traditional religious philosophy of St. Thomas and St. 
Augustine, in a form which bears unmistakable marks of the influence of 
Descartes' teachings. Among the Port-Royalists Cartesianism found 
ardent defenders in <b>Arnauld</b> (1612-1694) and <b>Nicole</b> (1625-
1695). Pascal, too, while he, no doubt, included Cartesianism in his 
condemnation of all purely rational philosophy, represents in his own 
doctrines a development of ideas which were germinally contained in the 
philosophy of Descartes. Finally <b>Geulincx</b> and <b>Malebranche</b> 
gave to Descartes' philosophy a more complete and definite form, and 
brought to light the elements of occasionalism and ontologism latent in 
it.<p>

<b>Blaise Pascal</b> (1623-1662) was born at Clermont, in Auvergne, and 
was educated at Paris. He became one of the most conspicuous figures in 
the Jansenist movement, and contributed to the literature of the 
Jansenist controversy the famous <i>Provincial Letters (Lettres 
provinciales)</i>. He made several important discoveries in mathematics 
and physics, and it was a treatise of his that formed the basis of 
<i>The Port-Royal Logic (L'art de penser)</i>, which appeared in 1662. 
The work entitled <i>Pens&eacute;es</i>, published in 1669, consists of 
fragmentary reflections intended to form part of a system of Christian 
philosophy. Some of these fragments are utterly sceptical in tone, 
while others breathe the spirit of dogmatic Stoicism. And, in point of 
fact, the fundamental thought in Pascal's mind reconciled both these 
extremes; for while he depreciates reason and condemns all purely 
rational philosophy, at the same time he exalts faith and insists that 
"the heart has reasons of which reason itself knows 
 <!--
GEULINCX 463 
 --><A NAME="p463"></a>
 nothing." From the point of view of reason and philosophy, man is an 
eternal enigma, truly great, yet no less truly miserable. "Man knows 
that he is miserable: he is therefore miserable, since he is so; but 
he is very great, since he knows it . . . If he exalts himself, I abase 
him: if he abases himself, I exalt him, and perpetually contradict him 
till he comprehends that he is an incomprehensible monster." Reason, 
therefore, cannot solve the mystery of man's state, nor can it discover 
the cause of his present condition, which is that of a king deposed. 
Faith alone, by means of the doctrine of original sin, answers the 
questions which reason can merely ask, and solves the riddle of human 
destiny. On regeneration by the redemption of Jesus Christ is the whole 
fabric of morality to be based. Consequently, faith, or as Pascal 
commonly expresses it, feeling, sentiment, the heart, is the supreme 
criterion of the highest truths in the speculative order, and of all 
moral truth.<p>

GEULINCX<p>

<b>Life</b>. Arnold Geulincx was born at Antwerp in the year 1625. 
After having studied and taught philosophy at Louvain, he went to 
Leyden, where he joined the Calvinists. At the University of Leyden he 
was appointed successively lector (1662) and professor extraordinary 
(1665) in the department of philosophy. He died at Leyden in the year 
1669.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Geulincx<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> developed the ontologism and occasionalism which were latent 
in the Cartesian separation of mind and matter, and in the Cartesian 
principle that matter is essentially inert.<p>

<b>Ontologism</b>. Unless I know how an event happens I am not its 
cause: <i>quod nescis quomodo fiat, id non facis</i>. Now, I am  
 <!--
464 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p464"></a>
 ignorant of the manner in which a sense-stimulus passes into, or 
becomes a sensation in, the mind. Therefore I do not cause the 
sensation. Neither does the body cause it; for the body is essentially 
inert, unconscious, non-rational. Consequently, the sensation -- and 
what is true of sensation is true of all knowledge -- is caused by 
God Himself, the body and the bodily stimulus being merely the 
occasions of the conscious act.<p>

<b>Occasionalism</b>. Similarly, I have no consciousness of the manner 
in which my volitions effect movements of my own body or of external 
things. It is not I, therefore, who produce these movements, but God, 
Who by divine decree (<i>instituto quodam decretoque divino</i>) 
ordained that material things should be the occasions of effects which 
He alone produces.<p>

<b>Ethical Doctrines</b>. From these speculative principles Geulinex 
deduces certain ethical doctrines. He assumes that where I can do 
nothing I ought not to will anything (<i>ubi nihil vales, ibi nihil 
velis</i>). It is my duty, therefore, to renounce the world and all 
worldly motives of action, to retire within myself and cultivate, in 
humility and patience, the supreme virtue which is <i>love of God and of 
reason (amor Dei ac rationis)</i>. In this system of conduct the 
hierarchical idea is not happiness, but duty.<p>

MALEBRANCHE<p>

<b>Life</b>. Nicolas Malebranche was born at Paris in 1638. In 1660 he 
entered the Paris house of the Oratory founded by St. Philip Neri. Four 
years later, the reading of Descartes' <i>Trait&eacute; de 
l'homme</i><sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> decided his philosophical vocation, and during the rest 
of his life he devoted himself as strenuously as his feeble health 
would permit to the elucidation and development of the Cartesian 
philosophy. He died in 1725. His most important work is <i>Recherche de la 
v&eacute;rit&eacute;</i>, which appeared in 1675.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup>

DOCTRINES<p>

Malebranche begins his search for truth by an inquiry into the 
<i>causes of error</i>. The principal source of error he finds to be 
belief in the trustworthiness of the senses; for the senses were given 
us to serve practical needs, and not for the purpose of revealing the 
natures of things. The external senses err in representing bodies as 
colored, etc., extension being the only quality which bodies possess. 
Similarly, the imagination deceives us; for its impressions come 
through the body. There is nothing left, then, but to trust in our 
ideas as representations of reality. But whence come our ideas? Not 
from external things; because no finite thing can produce anything, 
causal efficacy being the prerogative of the Deity 
(<i>occasionalism</i>). Indeed, all true philosophy, Malebranche 
observes, must teach that there is but one cause, just as all true 
religion must teach that there is but one God. Now, if finite being can 
produce nothing, and if God is the only cause, the conclusion is 
obvious that it is God Himself Who produces our ideas. In Him we see 
all things (<i>ontologism</i>): "nous voyons toutes choses en Dieu." He 
is the locus of our ideas; He is, therefore, in immediate relation with 
every thinking soul. What, then, one asks, has become of the soul 
itself? It is reduced to a mere <i>thought</i>; the soul <i>always 
thinks</i>, and thought is its being and its life.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Pascal, Geulincx, and Malebranche brought 
to the surface the elements of mysticism which lay hidden in Descartes' 
system of thought. The latter two developed also the latent ontologism 
and occasionalism of the Cartesian philosophy, and revealed the logical 
nexus between Cartesianism and pantheism. For, although Malebranche 
protested against the pantheism of "le mis&eacute;rable Spinoza," 
posterity has rightly pronounced his occasionalism to be Spinozism in 
the stage of arrested development -- pantheism held in check by faith 
in Christian revelation.<p>
