ARISTOTLE</h3><p>

The Socratic doctrine of concepts introduced into philosophy the notion 
of the universal. No sooner, however, had Socrates formulated the 
doctrine of universal concepts than the Cynics arose denying that 
anything exists except the individual. Thus it at once became necessary 
to define the true relation between the universal and the individual. 
This was the aim of Plato's theory of Ideas, in which the relation was 
explained by <i>deriving the individual</i> (in reality and in 
knowledge) <i>from the universal</i>. 
 <!--
LIFE OF ARISTOTLE 125 
 --><A NAME="p125"></a>
 Aristotle, judging that Plato's explanation was a failure, opened up 
the problem once more, and endeavored to solve it by deriving the 
universal (in reality and in knowledge) from the individual. The 
continuity of philosophic thought is, therefore, to be traced from 
Socrates, through Plato, to Aristotle, as if the imperfect Socratic and 
Platonic schools had not existed.<p>

Life.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup> Aristotle was born at Stagira, a seaport town of the colony of 
Chalcidice in Macedonia, in the year 384 B.C. His father, Nicomachus, 
was physician to King Amyntas of Macedon, and if, as is probable, the 
profession of medicine was long hereditary in the family, we may 
suppose that this circumstance was not without its influence in 
determining Aristotle's predilection for natural science. When he was 
eighteen years old, Aristotle went to Athens, where for twenty years he 
followed the lectures of Plato. Many stories are told concerning the 
strained relations between the aged teacher and his illustrious 
scholar, -- stories which, however, are without any foundation. 
There may indeed have been differences of opinion between master and 
pupil, but there was evidently no open breach of friendship, for in 
later years Aristotle continued to count himself among the Platonic 
disciples,<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> associated with Xenocrates on terms of intimate friendship, 
and showed in every way that his respect for his teacher was not 
lessened by the divergence of their philosophical opinions. Many of 
the tales told to Aristotle's discredit are traced to Epicurus and 
the Epicureans, -- calumniators by profession (grubbers of gossip, as 
Zeller calls them), -- and it is to be regretted that writers like St. 
Gregory Nazianzen and Justin Martyr were misled by statements which 
were manifestly made with hostile purpose. We are safe, therefore, in 
supposing that Aristotle was diligent and attentive pupil, and that he 
did not give expression to his criticism of Plato's theories until 
after he had listened to everything that Plato had to say in 
explanation and defense of his views.<p>

After Plato's death Aristotle repaired, in company with Xenocrates, to 
the court of Hermias, lord of Atarneus, whose sister or niece, Pythias, 
he married. In 343 he was summoned by Philip of Macedon to become the 
tutor of Alexander, who was then in his thirteenth year. The influence 
which he exercised on the mind of the future conqueror is described in 
Plutarch's <i>Alexander</i>. When Alexander departed on his Asiatic 
campaign 
 <!--
126 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p126"></a>
 Aristotle returned to Athens. This was about the year 335. It is 
possible that, as Gellius<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> says, Aristotle had, during his former 
residence at Athens, given lessons in rhetoric; it is certain that now 
for the first time he opened a school of philosophy. He taught in a 
gymnasium called the <i>Lyceum</i>, discoursing with his favorite 
pupils while strolling up and down the shaded walks around the 
gymnasium of Apollo, -- whence the name Peripatetics (from 
<b>peripate&ocirc;</b>).<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Through the generosity of his royal pupil, Aristotle was enabled to 
purchase a large collection of books, and to pursue his investigations 
of nature under the most favorable circumstances. His writings prove 
how fully he availed himself of these advantages: he became thoroughly 
acquainted with the speculations of his predecessors and neglected no 
opportunity of conducting, either personally or through the 
observations of others, a systematic study of natural phenomena. 
Towards the end of Alexander's life the relations between the 
philosopher and the great commander became somewhat strained. Still, so 
completely was Aristotle identified in the minds of the Athenians with 
the Macedonian party that after Alexander's death he was obliged to 
flee from Athens. The charge which was made the pretense of his 
expulsion from the city was the stereotyped one of impiety, to which 
charge Aristotle disdained to answer, saying (as the tradition is) that 
he would not give the Athenians an opportunity of offending a second 
time against philosophy. Accordingly, he left the city (in 323), 
repairing to Chalcis in Euboea. There he died in the year 322, a few 
months before the death of Demosthenes. There is absolutely no 
foundation for the fables narrated by so many ancient writers and 
copied by some of the early Fathers, that he died by poison or that he 
committed suicide by throwing himself into the Euboean Sea "because he 
could not explain the tides."<p>

<b>Aristotle's Character</b>. Eusebius, in his <i>Praeparatio 
Evangelica</i>, XV, 2, enumerates and refutes the accusations which 
were brought against Aristotle's personal character, quoting from 
Aristocles, a Peripatetic of the first century B.C. These accusations 
are practically the same as those which gained currency among the 
enemies and detractors of Plato, and are equally devoid of foundation. 
From Aristotle's writings, from fragments of his letters, from his 
will, as well as from the reliable accounts of his life, we are enabled 
to form a tolerably complete picture of his personal character. Noble, 
high-minded, thoroughly earnest, devoted to truth, courteous to his 
opponents, faithful to his friends, kind towards his slaves, he did not 
fall far short of the ideal moral life which he sketched in his ethical 
 <!--
ARISTOTLE'S WRITINGS 127 
 --><A NAME="p127"></a>
 treatise.  Compared with Plato, he exhibited greater universality of 
taste;  he was not an Athenian; in a certain sense, he was not a Greek 
at all. He exhibited in his character some of that cosmopolitanism 
which afterwards became a trait of the ideal philosopher.<p>

<b>Aristotle's Writings</b>.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> It is quite beyond dispute that some of 
the works which Aristotle compiled or composed have been lost. Thus, 
for example, the <b>anatomai</b> (containing anatomical charts), the 
<b>peri phit&ocirc;n</b> (the existing treatise <i>De Plantis</i> is by 
Theophrastus), the <b>politeiai</b> (a collection of constitutions of 
states; the portion which treats of the Constitution of Athens has been 
discovered in recent years), and the <i>Dialogues</i> are among the 
lost works. It is equally certain that many portions of the collected 
works of Aristotle as we now possess them are of doubtful authenticity, 
while it is possible that a still larger number of books or portions of 
books are little more than lecture notes amplified by the pupils who 
edited them. It is well, for example, for the student of the 
<i>Metaphysics</i> to know that, of the fourteen books which compose 
it, the first, third, fourth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth 
constitute the work as begun but not finished by Aristotle. Of the 
remaining books, the second and one half of the eleventh are pronounced 
spurious, while the rest are independent treatises which were not 
intended to form part of the work on first philosophy. Without entering 
into the more minute questions of authenticity, we may accept the 
following arrangement of Aristotle's works, with their Latin titles.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup>
  
LOGICAL TREATISES<p>

Constituting the <i>Organon</i>: (1) <i>Categoriae</i>, (2) <i>De 
Interpretatione</i>, (3) <i>Analytica Priora</i>, (4) <i>Analytica 
Posteriora</i>, (5) <i>Topica</i>, (6) <i>De Sophistices Elenchis</i>. 
These were first included under the title of <i>Organon</i> in 
Byzantine times.<p>

METAPHYSICAL TREATISE<p>

The work entitled <b>meta ta phusika</b> (or at least a portion of it) 
was styled by Aristotle <b>pr&ocirc;t&ecirc; philosophia</b>. Its 
present title is probably due to the place which it occupied (after 
the physical treatises) in the collection edited by Andronicus of Rhodes 
(about 70 B.C.).

ETHICAL TREATISES<p>

(1) <i>Ethica Nicomachea</i>, (2) <i>Politica</i>. The Eudemian Ethics 
is the work of Eudemus, although it is probable that it was intended as 
a recension of an Aristotelian treatise.<p>

RHETORICAL AND POETICAL TREATISES<p>

(1) <i>De Poetica</i>, (2) <i>De Rhetorica</i>. These are spurious in parts.<p>

Gellius<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> speaks of a twofold class of Aristotelian writings, the 
<i>exoteric</i>, which were intended for the general public,<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> and the 
<i>acroatic</i>, which were intended for those only who were versed in 
the phraseology and modes of thought of the school. All the extant 
works belong to the latter class. The story of the fate of Aristotle's 
works as narrated by Strabo<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> and repeated with the addition of a few 
details by Plutarch,<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> is regarded as reliable. It tells how the 
library of Aristotle fell into the hands of Theophrastus, by whom it 
was bequeathed to Neleus of Scepsis. After the death of Neleus the 
manuscripts were hidden in a cellar, where they remained for almost two 
centuries. When Athens was captured by the Romans in 84 B.C., the 
library was carried to Rome by Sulla. At Rome a grammarian named 
Tyrannion secured several copies, thus enabling Andronicus of Rhodes to 
collect the treatises and publish them. It must not, however, be 
inferred that the manuscripts hidden in the cellar for two hundred 
years were the only existing copy of Aristotle's works, or that during 
all those years the Peripatetic philosophers were without a copy of the 
works of Aristotle.  
 <!--
ARISTOTLE'S DIVISION OF PHILOSOPHY 129 
 --><A NAME="p129"></a>
 The subsequent history of the <i>Corpus Aristotelicum</i> and the 
story of the Syriac, Arabian, and Latin translations belong to the 
history of mediaeval ilosophy.<p>

ARISTOTLE'S PHILOSOPHY<p>

<b>General Character and Division</b>. Aristotle's concept of 
philosophy agrees, in the main, with that of Plato. Philosophy is 
<i>the science of the universal essence o that which is actual</i>.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> 
Aristotle is, however, more inclined than Plato was to attach a 
theoretical value to philosophy. The difference between the two 
philosophers is still greater in their respective notions of 
philosophic method. Aristotle does not begin with the universal and 
reason down to the particular; on the contrary, he Starts with 
particular data of experience and reasons up to the universal essence. 
His method is inductive as well as deductive. Consequently, he is more 
consistent than Plato in including the natural sciences in philosophy 
and considering them part of the body of philosophic doctrine. In fact, 
Aristotle makes philosophy to be coextensive with scientific knowledge. 
"All science (<b>dianoia</b>) is either <i>practical, poietical</i>, or 
<i>theoretical</i>."<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> By practical science he means politics and 
ethics; under the head poietic (<b>poi&ecirc;tike</b>) he includes not 
only the philosophy of poetry but the knowledge of the other imitative 
arts, while by theoretical philosophy he understands <i>Physics, 
Mathematics</i>, and <i>Metaphysics</i>. Metaphysics is philosophy in 
the stricter sense the word: it is <i>the knowledge of immaterial Being 
or of Being in the highest degree of abstraction</i> (<b>peri 
ch&ocirc;rista kai akin&ecirc;ta</b>); it is the pinnacle of all 
knowledge, the <i>theological science</i>. In this classification logic 
has no place, being apparently regarded as a science preparatory to 
philosophy.<p>

Our study of Aristotle's philosophy will, therefore, 
include: (A) <i>logic</i>; (B) <i>theoretical philosophy</i>, including 
(a) <i>metaphysics</i>,
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 130 
 --><A NAME="p130"></a>
 (b) <i>physics</i>. (c) <i>mathematics</i>; (C) <i>practical 
Philosophy</i>; (D) <i>poietical philosophy</i>.<p>

A. <b>Logic, including Theory of Knowledge</b>. Aristotle does not 
employ the word <i>logic</i> in the modern meaning of the term. The 
science which we call logic, and of which he is rightly considered the 
founder, was known to him as <i>analytic</i>. The <i>Organon</i>, as 
the body of logical doctrine was styled by the later Peripatetics, 
consists of six parts, or treatises<p>

1. The <i>Categoriae</i>. In the first of his logical treatises 
Aristotle gives his classification, or enumeration, of the highest 
classes (categories) into which all concepts, and consequently all real 
things, are divided; they are <i>substance, quantity, quality, 
relation, action, passion, place, time, situation</i>, and 
<i>habitus</i>. He intimates that these are intended as classes of 
things expressed by isolated words, <b>ta aneu sumplok&ecirc;s 
legomena</b>, that is to say, by words which do not form part of a 
proposition. They are to be distinguished, therefore, from the 
predicables, or classes of the possible relations in which the 
predicate of a proposition may stand to the subject. The predicables 
are <i>definition</i> (<b>hopos</b>), <i>genus, difference, 
property</i>, and <i>accident</i>.<p>

There can be no reasonable doubt as to the originality of the 
Aristotelian arrangement of categories. It is true that there is a 
remote analogy between the categories and the distinctions of the 
grammarian; but the analogy can be explained without supposing that 
Aristotle expressly intended to conform his categories to the 
grammatical divisions of words. It is also true that Aristotle does not 
always enumerate the categories in the same manner.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

2. The <i>De Interpretatione</i>. In the second of the logical 
treatises, Aristotle takes up the study of the <i>proposition</i> and 
the <i>judgment</i>. He distinguishes the different kinds of 
propositions, and treats of their opposition and conversion. This 
portion of his work forms the core of modern logical teaching. 
 <!--
ARISTOTLE'S LOGIC 131 
 --><A NAME="p131"></a><p>

3. The <i>Analytica Priora</i> contains the treatise on reasoning, 
deductive and inductive. In his doctrine of the <i>syllogism</i> 
Aristotle admits only three figures. (The syllogism, he teaches, is 
based on the <i>Law of Contradiction</i> and the <i>Law of Excluded 
Middle</i>.) He mentions three rules of the syllogism. <i>Induction</i> 
(<b>epag&ocirc;g&ecirc;</b>) he defines as reasoning from the 
particular to the general, and though the syllogism, which proceeds 
from the general to the particular, is more cogent, <i>in itself</i>, 
induction is, for us, easier to understand. The only kind of induction 
admitted by Aristotle is complete induction.<p>

4. In the <i>Analytica Posteriora</i> Aristotle takes up the study of 
demonstration (<b>apodeixis</b>). True demonstration, as indeed all 
true scientific knowledge, deals with the universal and necessary 
causes of things. Consequently, all true demonstration consists in 
showing causes, and the middle term in a demonstration must, therefore, 
express a cause. Not all truths, however, are capable of demonstration. 
The <i>first principles</i> of a science cannot be demonstrated in that 
science, and principles which are first, absolutely, are indemonstrable: 
they belong not to reason, but to intellect (<b>Nous</b>). To the class 
of indemonstrable truths belong also truths of immediate 
experience.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup><p>

5. The <i>Topica</i> has for subject-matter the <i>dialectical</i> or 
<i>problematic syllogism</i>, which differs from demonstration in this, 
that its conclusions are not certain but merely probable; they belong 
to opinion rather than to scientific knowledge. The <i>Topica</i> also 
treats of the <i>predicables</i>.<p>

6. The treatise <i>De Sophisticis Elenchis</i> contains Aristotle's 
atudy of <i>fallacies</i>, or <i>sophisms</i>. It contains also an 
attack on the Sophists and their methods. Before we proceed to explain 
Aristotle's metaphysical doctrines it is necessary to take up the 
principles of his theory of knowledge as we find them in the 
<i>Analytica Posteriora</i> and elsewhere in his logical and 
metaphysical treatises. 
 <!--
132 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p132"></a><p>

<b>Theory of Knowledge</b>. Nowhere does the contrast between the 
philosophy of Plato and that of Aristotle appear so clearly as in their 
theories of knowledge.<p>

1. Plato makes experience to be merely the occasion of scientific 
knowledge. Aristotle regards experience as the true source and true 
cause of all our knowledge intellectual as well as sensible.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup><p>

2. Plato begins with the universal (Idea) and attempts to descend to 
the particular (Phenomenon); Aristotle, while he recognizes that there 
is no science of the individual as such (<b>h&ecirc; d' 
epist&ecirc;m&ecirc; t&ocirc;n katholou</b>),<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> maintains, 
nevertheless, that <i>our knowledge of the individual precedes our 
knowledge of the universal</i>: <b>ek t&ocirc;n kath hekasta gar tou 
katholou</b>.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup><p>

3. Plato <i>hypostatized the universal</i>, attributing to it a 
separate existence. This, according to Aristotle, is to reduce the 
universal to a useless form; for, if the universal exists apart from 
the individual, there can be no transition from a knowledge of the one 
to a knowledge of the other. <i>The universal</i>, Aristotle teaches, 
<i>is not apart from individual things</i>.<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup><p>

4. Finally, according to Plato, the universal, as it exists apart from 
phenomena, is a full-blown univeral, endowed with the formal character 
of universality; according to Aristotle, the formal aspect of 
universality is conferred by the mind, and, therefore, <i>the 
universal, as such</i>,  does not exist in individual things, but <i>in 
the mind alone</i>. This is the only intelligible interpretation of 
such passages as <i>Metaphysics</i>, III, 4, 999 and <i>De Anima</i>, 
II, 5, 417, in which Aristotle maintains that the individual alone 
exists and that the universal is somehow (<b>p&ocirc;s</b>) in the 
mind.<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
ARISTOTLE'S THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE 133  
 --><A NAME="p133"></a><p>

Aristotle's theory of knowledge, as is evident from the four principles 
just explained, recognizes two fundamental attributes of intellectual 
knowledge: its <i>essential dependence</i> on sense-knowledge and its 
equally <i>essential superiority</i> to sense-knowledge.  Aristotle is 
as careful to avoid sensism on the one hand as he is to escape idealism 
on the other; for, though he admits that all knowledge begins with 
experience, he contends that intellectual thought (<b>no&ecirc;sis</b>) 
is concerned with the universal, or intelligible (<b>no&ecirc;ton</b>), 
while sense-knowledge has for its object the individual, the
 sense-perceived (<b>aisth&ecirc;ton</b>). The distinction of objects 
is made the basis and ground of a distinction of faculties and of kinds 
of knowledge.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup><p>

If, then, there is a distinction between sense-knowledge and thought, 
and if all knowledge begins with sense-knowledge, <i>how do we rise 
from the region of sense to that of intellect</i>? Aristotle answers by 
distinguishing first and second substance. The <i>first substance</i> 
(<b>ousia pr&ocirc;t&ecirc;</b>) is the individual, which can neither 
exist in another nor be predicated of another. <i>Second substance</i> 
is the universal, which, as such, does not exist in another, but may be 
predicated of another. In the individual substance we distinguish, on 
closer examination, two elements, the <b>hupokeimenon</b> or 
undetermined, determinable substratum, the <i>matter</i> 
(<b>hul&ecirc;</b>), and the determining principle, or <i>form</i> 
(<b>eidos</b>), by which the substance is made to be what it is.<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup> The 
essential nature, therefore, the unalterable essence corresponding to 
the conncept -- the object, consequently, of intellectual knowledge --
is the form. Matter, it is true, is part of the essential nature,<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup> 
but it is, as it were, the constant factor, always the same, and  of 
itself undifferentiated; it enters into a definition as <i>materia 
communis</i>, and when we designate the form of an object, implying the 
presence of matter in its general concept, we have answered the question, 
What is that object? The form, 
 <!--
134 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p134"></a>
 then, considered apart from the matter, is the essence of the object 
as far as intellectual knowledge is concerned; for intellectual 
knowledge has for its object the universal, and since matter is the 
principle of individuation, and form the principle of specification, 
the conclusion of the inquiry as to the object of intellectual 
knowledge is that matter and the individual qualities arising from 
matter belong to sense-knowledge, while the form alone, which is the 
universal, belongs to intellectual knowledge.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> Returning now to the 
question, How do we rise from the region of sense to the region of 
intellect? the object of sense-knowledge, we repeat, is the whole, the 
concrete individual substance. Thought, penetrating through the sense 
qualities, reaches the form, or quiddity, lying at the core of the 
substance, and this form, considered apart from the material conditions 
in which it is immersed, is the proper object of intellectual 
knowledge. Thus, the acquisition of scientific knowledge is a true 
<i>development</i> of sense-knowledge into intellectual knowledge, if 
by development is understood the process by which, under the agency of 
the intellect, the potentially intelligible elements of sense-knowledge 
are brought out into actual intelligibility. Aristotle himself 
describes the process as one of <i>induction</i> 
(<b>epag&ocirc;g&ecirc;</b>) or abstraction (aphairesis).<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup><p>

B. <b>Theoretical Philosophy</b>, a. <b>Metaphysics</b>. In the 
foregoing account of Aristotle's theory of knowledge it has been found 
necessary to mention form, matter, and substance, notions which 
properly belong to this division of his philosophy.<p>

I. <i>Definition of metaphysics</i>. Metaphysics, or first philosophy, 
is <i>the science of Being as Being</i>.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> Other sciences have to do 
with the proximate causes and principles of Being, and, therefore, with 
Being in its lower determinations Metaphysics considers Being as such, 
in its highest or most general determinations, and consequently it is 
concerned with the highest, 
 <!--
ARISTOTLE'S METAPHYSICS 135
 --><A NAME="p135"></a>
 or ultimate, causes. Accordingly, on metaphysics devolves the task of 
considering the axioms of all sciences in so far as these axioms are 
laws of all existence. For this reason it is that in the 
<i>Metaphysics</i> Aristotle takes up the explanation and defense of 
the <i>Law of Contradiction</i>.<p>

2. <i>Negative teaching</i>. Before proceeding to answer the problem of 
metaphysics, What are the principles of Being? Aristotle passes in 
review the answers given by his predecessors. He not only recounts the 
doctrines and opinions of the pre-Socratic philosophers, -- thereby 
adding to his many titles that of <i>Founder of the History of 
Philosophy</i>, -- but he also points out what seem to him to be the 
shortcomings and imperfections of each school or system. His 
<i>criticism of Plato's theory of Ideas</i> is deserving of careful 
study, because it is an unprejudiced examination of a great system of 
thought by one who was unusually well equipped for the task, and also 
because it is the most natural and intelligible introduction to the 
positive portion of Aristotle's <i>Metaphysics</i> in which he expounds 
his own views.<p>

Both Plato and Aristotle maintain that scientific knowledge is 
concerned with the universal (compare Socratic doctrine of concepts). 
They agree in teaching that the world of sense is subject to change 
and that we must go beyond it to find the world of ideas. Here, 
however, they part company. Plato places the world of Ideas, the region of 
scientific knowledge, outside phenomena; Aristotle places it in 
the sensible objects themselves. it is, therefore, against the doctrine 
of a separate world of Ideas that all Aristotle's criticism of Plato's 
theory is directed.<p>

(a) In the first place, Aristotle contends<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup> that the Platonic theory 
of Ideas <i>is wholly barren</i>. The Ideas were intended to explain 
how things came to be and how they came to be known; but they cannot be 
principles of Being, since they are not <i>existent in</i> things, and 
they cannot be principles of knowledge, since 
 <!--
136 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
 --><A NAME="p136"></a>
 they exist apart from and have no intelligible relation to the things 
to be known. To suppose that we know things better by adding to the 
world of our experience the world of Ideas, is as absurd as to imagine 
that we can count better by multiplying the numbers to be counted. In a 
word, the Ideas are a meaningless duplication of sensible objects.<p>

(b) In the next place, Aristotle<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup> recognizes in the theory of Ideas 
an attempt at solving the <i>problem of motion and change</i>. Indeed, 
since the Ideas are the only reality, they must contain the principle 
of change, for change is a reality; but Plato, by separating the Ideas 
from the world of phenomena, and by insisting on the static rather than 
on the dynamic phase of the Ideas, precluded all possibility of 
accounting for change by means of the Ideas.<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup><p>

(c) Moreover, Aristotle finds several <i>contradictions in the Platonic 
theory</i>. He is not satisfied with the Platonic doctrine of community 
between the Idea and the phenomenon; for, if the participation of the 
Idea by the phenomenon is anything more than a mere figure of speech, 
if there is really part of the Idea in the phenomenon, there must be a 
prototype on which this participation is modeled. If such a prototype 
exists, there is, for example, a tritos anthr&ocirc;pos in addition to 
the absolute Idea of man and the man who exists in the world of 
phenomena. The significant fact is that Plato at one time describes the 
participation as <b>methexis</b> at another as <b>mim&ecirc;sis</b> and 
ends by leaving it unexplained.<sup><small><a name="n29"><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></a></small></sup><p>

(d) Finally, the reason why Plato introduced the doctrine of Ideas was 
because scientific knowledge must have for its object something other 
than the phenomenon. Now, scientific knowledge has an object, if Ideas 
<i>exist</i>. The <i>validity of scientific knowledge</i> does not 
require that the Idea should exist <i>apart from the phenomenon 
itself</i><sup><small><a name="n30"><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></a></small></sup>

3. <i>Positive teaching</i>. Metaphysics, as has been said, is the 
inquiry into the highest principles of Being. A principle 
(<b>arch&ecirc;</b>) is that by which a thing is or is known.<sup><small><a name="n31"><a href="#n_31">{31}</a></a></small></sup> The 
first problem of metaphysics is, therefore, to determine the relation 
between <i>actuality</i> and <i>potentiality</i>, the first principles 
of Being in the order of determination, or differentiation. Actuality 
(<b>entelecheia energeia</b>) is perfection, potentiality 
(<b>dunamis</b>) is the capability of perfection. The former is the 
determining principle of being, the latter is of itself indeterminate. 
Actuality and potentiality are above all categories; they are found in 
all beings with the exception of One, whose being is all actuality. In 
created being, then, as we should say, there is a mixture of potency 
and actuality. This mixture is, so to speak, the highest metaphysical 
formula, under which are included the compositions of matter and form, 
substance and accident, the soul and its faculties, active and passive 
intellect, etc. The dualism of actual and potential pervades the 
metaphysics, physics, psychology, and even the logic of Aristotle.<p>

Still, potency and actuality are principles of Being in its 
metaphysical determinations. In the physical order, there enter into  
the constitution of concrete being four other principles called 
<i>causes</i> (<b>aitiai</b>). A cause is defined as <i>that which in 
any way influences the production of something</i>: it is, therefore, a 
principle in the order of physical determination. The classes of causes 
are_four, -- <i>matter</i> (<b>hul&ecirc;</b>), <i>form</i> 
(<b>eidos</b> or <b>morph&ecirc;</b>), <i>efficient cause</i> (<b>to 
kin&ecirc;tikon</b>), and final cause (<b>to hou heneka</b>).<sup><small><a name="n32"><a href="#n_32">{32}</a></a></small></sup> Of 
these, matter and form are intrinsic constituents of being, while 
efficient and final causes are extrinsic principles. Nevertheless, 
these latter are true causes inasmuch as the effect depends on them.<p>

<i>Matter</i>, or <i>material cause</i>, is that <i>out of which</i> 
being is made; bronze, for example, is the material cause of the 
statue. Matter is the substratum (<b>hupokeimenon</b>), indeterminate 
but capable of determination. It is the receptacle (<b>dektikon</b>) of 
Becoming and 
 <!--
138 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p138"></a>
 decay.<sup><small><a name="n33"><a href="#n_33">{33}</a></a></small></sup> It can neither exist nor be known without form. In a word, 
it is potency. Matter in the condition of absolute potentiality is 
called <i>first matter</i> (<b>hule pr&ocirc;t&ecirc;</b>), that is, 
matter without any form. <i>Second matter</i> is matter in the 
condition of relative potentiality. Second matter possesses a form, but 
because of its capability of further determination it is in potency to 
receive other forms.<p>

<i>Form</i>, or <i>formal cause</i>, is that into which a thing is 
made. It is the principle of determination overcoming the 
indeterminateness of matter. Without it matter cannot exist: it is 
actuality. The Aristotelian notion of form, like the Platonic notion of 
Idea, was intended as a protest against the scepticism of the Sophists 
and the panmetabolism of the Heracliteans. Form is the object of 
intellectual knowledge, the unalterable essence of things, which 
remains unchanged amid the fluctuations of accidental qualities. Like 
the Idea, the form is the plentitude of actual being, for while matter 
is a reality, it is real merely as a potency. There is, however, a 
radical difference between the form and the Idea; the form exists in 
individual beings, the Idea exists apart from them: Aristotle merely 
<i>distinguished</i> matter and form; Plato not only 
<i>distinguished</i> but also <i>separated</i> the Idea from the 
phenomenon.<p>

The union of matter and form constitutes the individual or concrete, 
substance (<b>to sunolon, ousia pr&ocirc;t&ecirc;</b>). From matter  
arise the imperfections, limitations, and individuating qualities; from 
form come the essential, unalterable attributes, the specific nature of 
the substance. Matter, then, being presupposed as the common substratum 
of material existence, a substance is constituted in its essential 
nature by the form. Hence it is that Aristotle identifies the form with 
the essence, the quiddity (<b>to ti en einai</b>),<sup><small><a name="n34"><a href="#n_34">{34}</a></a></small></sup> the universal 
nature of a substance. Form  
 <!--
ARISTOTLE'S METAPHYSICS 139
 --><A NAME="p139"></a>
 is a second substance (<b>ousia deutera</b>) which, while it cannot 
inhere in another as in a subject, may, on account of its universality, 
be predicated of many. It would, however, be a serious mistake to 
represent Aristotle as reducing all reality to form, and ending as 
Plato had begun, with the doctrine of monism. For matter, in its 
generic concept, enters into the definition of the specific nature, and 
while it is not an actual, it is a real principle of being.<sup><small><a name="n35"><a href="#n_35">{35}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Aristotle further develops his theory of the relation between matter 
and form by teaching that matter is destined to receive form. It tends 
towards its form with something akin to desire: for the absence of form 
is not mere negation; it is <i>privation</i> (<b>ater&ecirc;sis</b>). 
Aristotle, however, explains<sup><small><a name="n36"><a href="#n_36">{36}</a></a></small></sup> that matter is not pure privation. It 
is a positive something which, of its nature, is disposed to become 
determined by means of form.<p> 

<i>Efficient cause</i> is the third principle of being. It is defined 
as that <i>by which</i> (that is, by the agency of which) the effect is 
produced. Ultimately, it is form considered as operative, for no agent 
can act except by virtue of the form, which is the principle of its 
action as well as of its being.<sup><small><a name="n37"><a href="#n_37">{37}</a></a></small></sup> Hence the Scholastic adage, <i>Agere 
sequitur esse</i>. Moreover, all action is motion (kin&ecirc;sis), and 
motion is defined as the passing from potency to actuality: <b>he tou 
duname ontos entelecheia he toiouton</b>.<sup><small><a name="n38"><a href="#n_38">{38}</a></a></small></sup> This identification of 
action with motion, and the definition of motion in terms of the actual 
and potential, lead at once to a conclusion which is, at first sight, 
startling in its universality, -- that all natural processes are 
processes of development, and that action merely brings out latent 
possibilities by bringing into actuality those perfections which were 
already contained as potencies in the matter. This generalization, it 
may be remarked, is in perfect harmony with modern physical principles, 
as, for  
 <!--
140 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p140"></a>
 example, with the Law of the Conservation of Energy. Aristotle, it is 
true, does not enter into the question of quantitative relations 
between the potential and the actual. But the higher the human mind 
rises in its inquiries, the less attention it pays to questions of 
quantitative equivalence, and the more importance it attaches to the 
general notion of internal development.<p>

<i>Final cause</i>, the fourth principle of being, that on account of 
which the effect is produced, is, in a certain sense, the most 
important of all the causes.<sup><small><a name="n39"><a href="#n_39">{39}</a></a></small></sup> It not only determines whether the agent 
shall act, but it also determines the mode and manner of the action and 
the measure of the effect produced, so that if we could know the motive 
or end of an action, we should be in possession of a most fruitful 
source of knowledge concerning the result of that action. The final 
cause, like the efficient, is, in ultimate analysis, identical with 
form; it is the form of the effect, presented in intention and 
considered as a motive, inasmuch as by its desirability it impels the 
agent to act.<p>

By the reduction of efficient and final causes to formal cause the 
ultimate principles of (finite) being are reduced to two, matter and 
form. These are the two intrinsic, essential constituents of the 
individual, concrete object, matter being the source of 
indeterminateness, potency, and imperfection, while form is the source 
of specific determination, actuality, and perfection.<p>

The Aristotelian doctrine of causes is a synthesis of all preceding 
systems of philosophy. The Earlier Ionians spoke generically of cause; 
the Later Ionians distinguished material and efficient causes; 
Socrates, developing the doctrine of Anaxagoras, introduced the notion 
of final cause; Plato was the first to speak of formal causes --  
unless the Pythagorean notion of number may be regarded as an attempt 
to find a formal principle of being. Thus did the generic notion of 
cause gradually undergo differentiation into the four kinds of cause. 
Aristotle was 
 <!--
ARISTOTLE'S METAPHYSICS 141 
 --><A NAME="p141"></a>
 the first to advert to this historical dialectic of the idea of cause, 
and to give the different kinds of cause a place in his doctrine of the 
principles of being. Consequently, the Aristotelian doctrine of cause 
is a true development, a transition from the undifferentiated to the 
differentiated, and nowhere do we realize more clearly than in this 
doctrine of cause that Aristotle's philosophy is the culmination of all 
the philosophies which preceded it.<p>

According to Aristotle, metaphysics is rightly called the 
<i>theological science</i>, because God is the highest object of 
metaphysical inquiry. For, although we may in our analysis of the 
principles of being descend to the lowest determination, -- or, rather, 
to the lack of all determination, -- <i>materia prima</i>, we may turn 
in the opposite direction, and by following the ascending scale of 
differentiation arrive at the notion of pure actuality, or Being in the 
highest grade of determinateness. Aristotle, in his proofs of the 
existence of God, did not set aside the teleological argument of 
Socrates.<sup><small><a name="n40"><a href="#n_40">{40}</a></a></small></sup> Devoted as he was to the investigation of nature, and 
especially to the study of living organisms, he could not fail to be 
struck by the adaptation everywhere manifest in natural phenomena, and 
particularly in the phenomena of life. He recognized, however, that the 
teleological is not the strongest argument for the existence of a 
Supreme Being. Accordingly, we find him establishing the existence of 
God by means of proofs more properly metaphysical than was the argument 
from design. He argues, for example,<sup><small><a name="n41"><a href="#n_41">{41}</a></a></small></sup> that, although motion is 
eternal, there cannot be an infinite series of movers and moved; there 
must, therefore, be one, the first in the series, which is unmoved, the 
<b>pr&ocirc;ton kinoun akin&ecirc;ton</b>. Again,<sup><small><a name="n42"><a href="#n_42">{42}</a></a></small></sup> he argues that 
<i>the actual is, of its nature, antecedent to the potential</i>. 
Consequently, before all matter, and before all composition of actual 
and potential, pure actuality  
 <!--
142 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p142"></a>
 must have existed. Actuality is, therefore, the cause of all things 
that are, and, since it is pure actuality, its life is essentially free 
from all material conditions; it is the thought of thought (no&ecirc;sis 
no&ecirc;se&ocirc;s).<p>

To the question, What does Aristotle understand by the <i>primum movens 
immobile</i> and the <i>actus purus</i>? the answer seems to be that by 
the former of these expressions he meant something other than the 
Supreme Being. In the <i>Physics</i>, where he speaks of <i>primum 
mobile</i>, or rather of the <i>prima moventia non mota</i>,<sup><small><a name="n43"><a href="#n_43">{43}</a></a></small></sup> he 
describes the first being as the first in the order of efficient 
causes, an intelligence, the <i>primum coelum</i>. This, which is moved 
by the sight of the supreme intelligence of God, not, therefore, by any 
efficient cause, but by a final cause only, sets in motion the whole 
machinery of efficient causes beneath it. In the <i>Metaphysics</i>, 
however, our philosopher pursues his investigation into the realms 
beyond the first heaven, and finds that the intelligence which moves by 
its desirability the soul of the first heaven is the intelligence of 
intelligence, pure actuality, God.<sup><small><a name="n44"><a href="#n_44">{44}</a></a></small></sup> This is the interpretation of St. 
Thomas,<sup><small><a name="n45"><a href="#n_45">{45}</a></a></small></sup> who, while he regards God as the immediate efficient cause of 
the first motion of the universe, interprets Aristotle to mean that the 
First Intelligence moves merely by the desire which He inspires, 
drawing towards Him the soul of the first heaven. And it is natural to 
expect that in the philosophy of Aristotle there should be a supreme in 
the physical order as well as a supreme in the metaphysical order; that 
the metaphysical concept of First Intelligence should complete and 
round out the physical concept of a first mover.<sup><small><a name="n46"><a href="#n_46">{46}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>God is one</i>, for matter is the principle of plurality, and the 
First Intelligence is entirely free from material conditions. His life 
is <i>contemplative thought</i>; neither providence nor will is  
 <!--
ARISTOTLE'S PHYSICS 143
 --><A NAME="p143"></a>
 compatible with the eternal repose in which He dwells.<sup><small><a name="n47"><a href="#n_47">{47}</a></a></small></sup> 
Nevertheless, Aristotle sometimes speaks of God as taking an interest 
in human affairs.<sup><small><a name="n48"><a href="#n_48">{48}</a></a></small></sup> The truth is that Aristotle's idea of God was, like 
Plato's, far from being a clear or even a coherent concept. Aristotle 
was content with deducing from his philosophical principles the idea of 
a Supreme Self-Conscious Intelligence, but he had no adequate 
conception of the relation between self-consciousness and personality. 
It was left for Christian philosophy to determine and develop the 
notion of divine person.<p>

We find the same indefiniteness in Aristotle's account of the origin of 
the World. The world, he taught, is eternal; for matter, motion, and 
time are eternal. Yet the world is caused.<sup><small><a name="n49"><a href="#n_49">{49}</a></a></small></sup> But how, according to 
Aristotle, is the world caused? Brentano<sup><small><a name="n50"><a href="#n_50">{50}</a></a></small></sup> believes that Aristotle 
taught the doctrine of creation <i>ex nihilo</i>, and there can be no 
doubt that St. Augustine and St. Thomas<sup><small><a name="n51"><a href="#n_51">{51}</a></a></small></sup> saw no contradiction in 
maintaining that a being may be eternal and yet created. The most 
conservative critics must grant that while Aristotle does not maintain 
the origin of the world by creation, he teaches the priority of act 
with respect to potency, thus implying that since the first potency was 
caused, it must have been caused <i>ex nihilo</i>. His premises, if 
carried to their logical conclusion, would lead to the doctrine of 
creation.<sup><small><a name="n52"><a href="#n_52">{52}</a></a></small></sup><p>

b. <b>Physics</b>. Physics, the study of nature, considers existence, 
not as it is in itself, but so far as it participates in movement 
(<b>kin&ecirc;se&ocirc;s metechei</b>).<sup><small><a name="n53"><a href="#n_53">{53}</a></a></small></sup> <i>Nature</i> includes 
everything which has in itself the principle of motion and rest. The 
works of nature differ from the products of art because, while the 
latter have no tendency to change (their originating principle being 
 <!--
144 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p144"></a>
 external to them), nature is essentially spontaneous, that is,
 self-determining from within.<sup><small><a name="n54"><a href="#n_54">{54}</a></a></small></sup> Nature does not, however, develop 
this internal activity except according to definite law. There is no 
such thing as accident or hazard: "Nature does nothing in vain."<sup><small><a name="n55"><a href="#n_55">{55}</a></a></small></sup> 
"Nature is always striving for the best."<sup><small><a name="n56"><a href="#n_56">{56}</a></a></small></sup> Thus, although Aristotle 
expressly rejects the Platonic idea of a world-soul, he recognizes in 
nature a <i>definite teleological concept, a plan of development</i>, 
to which the only obstacle is matter; for matter it is, that, by 
resisting the form, forces nature, as it were, to be content with the 
better in lieu of the best. The striving of nature is, therefore, 
through the less perfect to the more perfect.<sup><small><a name="n57"><a href="#n_57">{57}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Space</i> (<b>topos</b>) is neither matter nor form; it is not the 
interval between bodies. It is "the first and unmoved limit of the 
enclosing, as against the enclosed," <b>to tou periechontos peras 
akin&ecirc;ton pr&ocirc;ton</b>,<sup><small><a name="n58"><a href="#n_58">{58}</a></a></small></sup> that is to say, the surface (of the 
surrounding air, water, or solid substance) which is immediately 
contiguous to the body said to be in space, and which, though it may 
change, is considered as unmoved, because the circumscribed limits 
remain the same. Particular space is, therefore, coterminous with 
extended body, and space in general is coterminous with the limits of 
the world. Space is actually finite, yet potentially infinite, inasmuch 
as extension is capable of indefinite increase.<sup><small><a name="n59"><a href="#n_59">{59}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Time (<b>chronos</b>), which, like space, is the universal concomitant 
of sensible existence, is the measure of the succession of motion, 
<b>arithmos kin&ecirc;se&ocirc;s kata to proteron kai husteron</b>.<sup><small><a name="n60"><a href="#n_60">{60}</a></a></small></sup> 
The only reality in time is the present moment; in order to join the 
past and the future with the present, that is, in order to measure 
motion, mind is required. If there were no mind, there would be no 
time.<sup><small><a name="n61"><a href="#n_61">{61}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
ARISTOTLE'S PHYSICS 145  
 --><A NAME="p145"></a>
 movement (<b>kin&ecirc;sis</b>) is the mode of existence of a 
potential being becoming actualized, h&ecirc; tou dunamei ontos 
entelecheia h&ecirc; toiouton.<sup><small><a name="n62"><a href="#n_62">{62}</a></a></small></sup> Motion not require, nor does it 
postulate, a vacuum, since we may imagine that another body leaves the 
space which the moving body enters.<sup><small><a name="n63"><a href="#n_63">{63}</a></a></small></sup> Besides substantial change, of 
which matter is the substratum, three kinds of motion are recognized by 
Aristotle, --  quantitative, qualitative, and spatial (<b>phora</b>).<p>

In his <i>stoichiology</i> Aristotle adopts the four elements, or 
radical principles, which Empedocles introduced. He teaches, however, 
that the celestial space is filled with a body different from the four 
elements. This seems to be the part assigned by him to 
<i>ether</i>.<sup><small><a name="n64"><a href="#n_64">{64}</a></a></small></sup> Ether, then, is neither a fifth element entering with 
the other four into the constitution of the terrestrial world, nor, as 
is sometimes maintained, an undifferentiated substratum, like the 
<b>apeiron</b> of Anaximander, from which the four elements originated. 
It is the constituent of celestial bodies. The natural motion of ether 
is circular; that of the other elements is upward or downward, 
according as they are naturally endowed with lightness or with 
heaviness. It is hardly necessary to remark that until Newton's time 
there existed the belief that each particular body moved towards its 
own place, upward or downward, in virtue of the light or heavy elements 
which it contained.<p> 

Aristotle's <i>astronomical doctrines</i> were not in advance of the 
notions of the age to which he belonged.  The earth, the center of the 
cosmic system, is spherical and stationary.  It is surrounded by a 
sphere of air and a sphere of fire. In these spheres are fixed the 
heavenly bodies, which daily revolve round the earth from east to west, 
though seven of them revolve in longer periods from west to east. 
Outside all is the heaven of fixed stars, the <b>pr&ocirc;tos 
uranos</b>. It is next to the Deity, who imparted to its circumference 
a circular motion, thus mediately putting in motion the rest of the 
cosmic machinery. 
 <!--
146 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p146"></a>
 Aristotle agrees with Plato in teaching that the first heaven, like 
all the other heavenly bodies, is animated.<p>

It is in his <i>biological doctrines</i> that Aristotle shows how far 
he excels all his predecessors as a student of nature. When we consider 
the difficulties with which he had to contend, -- he never dissected a 
human body, and probably never examined a human skull; he did not in 
any adequate sense dissect the bodies of animals, although he observed 
their entrails, -- when we remember that he was obliged to reckon time 
without the aid of a watch, and to observe degrees of temperature and 
atmospheric changes without the aid of a thermometer or a barometer, we 
realize that the words of superlative praise in which Cuvier, Buffon, 
and others speak of him as a naturalist are far from being undeserved. 
His mistakes<sup><small><a name="n65"><a href="#n_65">{65}</a></a></small></sup> are due to conditions which limited his power of 
personal observation. Despite these limitations he did observe a great 
deal, and observed accurately, discussing, classifying, comparing his 
facts before drawing his conclusions. His <i>Histories of Animals</i>, 
for example, is a vast record of investigations made by himself and 
others on the appearance, habits, and mental peculiarities of the 
different classes of animals.<p>

Life is defined as the power of self-movement<sup><small><a name="n66"><a href="#n_66">{66}</a></a></small></sup> The principle that all 
action is development applies here as elsewhere in nature. Everywhere 
in the world of natural phenomena there is continuity; life and its 
manifestations offer no exception. Non-living matter gives rise to 
living things: the sponge is intermediate between plants and 
animals;<sup><small><a name="n67"><a href="#n_67">{67}</a></a></small></sup> the monkey (<b>pith&ecirc;koi k&ecirc;boi, 
kunokephaloi</b>) is intermediate between quadrupeds and man.<sup><small><a name="n68"><a href="#n_68">{68}</a></a></small></sup> The 
lower animals are divided into nine classes: viviparous quadrupeds, 
oviparous quadrupeds, birds, fishes, whales, mollusks, Malacostraca, 
Testacea, and insects; of these the first  
 <!--
ARISTOTLE'S PSYCHOLOGY 147
 --><A NAME="p147"></a>
 five classes are blood-possessing, the latter four being bloodless. In 
his <i>anatomical studies</i> he divided organs into 
<b>homoiomer&ecirc;</b> (made up of parts which are like the whole 
organ) and <b>anomoiomer&ecirc;</b> (made up of parts which are unlike 
the whole, as the hand is made up of the palm and fingers).<sup><small><a name="n69"><a href="#n_69">{69}</a></a></small></sup> 
<i>Digestion</i> and <i>secretion</i> are the results of a cooking 
process.<sup><small><a name="n70"><a href="#n_70">{70}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The soul is the principle of that movement from within which life has 
been defined to be. It is the form of the body, <b>psuch&ecirc; estin 
entelecheia he pr&ocirc;te s&ocirc;matos phusikou dunamei z&ocirc;en 
echontos</b>,<sup><small><a name="n71"><a href="#n_71">{71}</a></a></small></sup> and its relation to the body is generically the same 
as that of form to matter. <i>Soul</i>, then, is not synonymous with 
<i>mind</i>: it is not merely <i>the principle of thought</i>; it is 
<i>the principle of life</i>, and psychology is the science of all 
vital manifestations, but more particularly of sensation and thought. 
Thought is peculiar to man; but, since in the hierarchy of existence 
the more perfect contains the less perfect, the study of the human soul 
includes all the problems of psychology.<p>

What, then, is the human soul? It is not a mere harmony of the body, as 
some of the older philosophers taught.<sup><small><a name="n72"><a href="#n_72">{72}</a></a></small></sup> It is not <i>one of the four 
elements</i>, nor is it <i>a compound of the four</i>, because exhibits 
powers (of thought) which transcend all the conditions of material 
existence.<sup><small><a name="n73"><a href="#n_73">{73}</a></a></small></sup> In no sense, therefore, can it be said to be corporeal. 
And yet it is united with the body, being, according to its definition, 
the form of the body. For the body has mere potency of life; all the 
actuality of the body comes from the soul. The soul is <i>the 
realization of the end for which the body exists</i>, -- the <b>to tou 
heneka</b> of its being: <i>Soul and body</i>, although distinct, 
<i>are one substance</i>, just as the wax and the Impression stamped 
upon it are one.<sup><small><a name="n74"><a href="#n_74">{74}</a></a></small></sup> It is worthy of note that, as in metaphysics 
Aristotle distinguishes, without separating, the universal from the 
individual, so in psychology he maintains  
 <!--
148 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p148"></a> 
 on the one hand the <i>distinction</i>, and on the other the 
<i>substantial unity</i> of soul and body in man.<p>

The soul, the radical principle of all vital phenomena, is one; still 
we may distinguish in the individual soul several <i>faculties</i> 
(<b>dunameis</b>) which are not parts of the soul but merely different 
phases of it according as it performs different vital functions. The 
soul and its faculties are, to use Aristotle's favorite comparison, 
like the concave and the convex of a curve, -- different views of one 
and the same thing. The faculties of the human soul are: (1) 
<i>nutritive</i> (<b>threptikon</b>), (2) <i>sensitive</i> 
(<b>aisth&ecirc;tikon</b>), (3) <i>appetitive</i> (<b>orektikon</b>), 
(4) <i>locomotive</i> (<b>kin&ecirc;tikon</b>), and (5) <i>rational</i> 
(<b>logikon</b>). Of these, the sensitive and the rational faculties 
claim special attention.<sup><small><a name="n75"><a href="#n_75">{75}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Sensation</i> is the faculty "by which we receive the forms of 
sensible things without the matter, as the wax receives the figure of 
the seal without the metal, of which the seal is composed."<sup><small><a name="n76"><a href="#n_76">{76}</a></a></small></sup> This 
form without the matter (<b>eidos aisth&ecirc;ton</b>) is what the 
schoolmen called the <i>species sensibilis</i>; it differs essentially 
from the "effluxes" of which Empedocles spoke, for these latter are 
forms "with matter." Besides, the Aristotelian <b>tupos</b> is not, like 
the "efflux," a diminished object, but a medium of communication 
between object and subject. Sensation is a movement of the soul,<sup><small><a name="n77"><a href="#n_77">{77}</a></a></small></sup> 
and, like every other movement, it has its active and its passive 
phase. The active phase is what we call the <i>stimulus</i>; the 
passive phase is the <i>species</i>. Now, the active and passive phases 
of a movement are one and the same motion. The species, therefore, is 
merely the passive phase of the stimulus, or the operation of the 
object, as Aristotle calls it. This is the explicit teaching of the 
treatise <i>De Anima</i>. For example, <b>h&ecirc; de tou 
aisth&ecirc;tou energeia kai t&ecirc;s aisth&ecirc;se&ocirc;s h&ecirc;

ARISTOTLE'S PSYCHOLOGY 149  
 --><A NAME="p149"></a><p>

Aristotle distinguished five <i>external senses</i>, to each of which 
corresponds its proper object (<b>aisth&ecirc;ton idion</b>). Besides 
objects proper to each sense, there are objects common (<b>koina</b>) 
to several senses, such as movement, and there is the <i>sensibile per 
accidens</i>, or inferential object (<b>kata sumbeb&ecirc;kos</b>), 
such as substance.<sup><small><a name="n79"><a href="#n_79">{79}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Among the internal senses the most important is the <i>common</i> or 
<i>central, sense</i> (<b>aisth&ecirc;t&ecirc;rion koinon</b>). By it 
we distinguish the separate communications of the external senses, and 
by it also we perceive that we perceive. It has its seat not in the 
brain, but in the heart. Having no idea of the function of the nerves, 
Aristotle naturally regarded the veins as the great channels of 
communication, and the heart as the center of functional activity in 
the body.<sup><small><a name="n80"><a href="#n_80">{80}</a></a></small></sup> Moreover, he observed that the brain substance is itself 
incapable of responding to sensation stimulus.<sup><small><a name="n81"><a href="#n_81">{81}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In addition to the central sense, <i>memory</i> and <i>imagination</i> 
are mentioned by Aristotle as internal senses. Imagination, as a 
process (<b>phantasia</b>), is the movement resulting from the act of 
sensation; as a faculty, it is the locus of the pictures 
(<b>phantasmata</b>), which are the materials out ef which reason 
generates the idea.<sup><small><a name="n82"><a href="#n_82">{82}</a></a></small></sup> Without the phantasm it is impossible to reason 
(<b>noein ouk estin anen phantasmatos</b>).<sup><small><a name="n83"><a href="#n_83">{83}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<i>Intellect</i>. (<b>nous</b>) is the faculty by which man acquires 
intellectual knowledge. It differs from all the sense faculties in 
This, that while the latter are concerned with the concrete and 
individual, it has for its object the abstract and universal.<sup><small><a name="n84"><a href="#n_84">{84}</a></a></small></sup> "It is 
well called the <i>locus</i> of ideas," says Aristotle,<sup><small><a name="n85"><a href="#n_85">{85}</a></a></small></sup> "if we 
understand that it is the potential source of ideas, for in the 
beginning it is without ideas, it is like a smooth tablet on which 
nothing is written." We must always bear in mind this twofold relation 
of intellect to sense, namely, <i>distinction</i> and <i>dependence</i>. 
 <!--
150 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p150"></a><p>

The process by which the intellect rises from the individual to the 
universal has already been described in part. It is a process of 
<i>development</i>. The material on which the intellect works is the 
individual image (phantasm), or the individual object; the result of 
the process is the intelligible form, or idea, and the process itself 
is one of <i>unfolding</i> the individual so as to reveal the universal 
contained in it. The intellect does not create the idea; it merely 
<i>causes the object which was potentially intelligible to become 
actually intelligible</i>, "in the same way as light causes the 
potentially colored to become actually colored."<sup><small><a name="n86"><a href="#n_86">{86}</a></a></small></sup> The expressions 
"developing," "unfolding," "illuminating," are, of course, 
metaphorical: what really takes place is a process of abstraction, a 
separation of the individuating qualities from the universal, or an 
induction, that is to say, a bringing together of individuals under a 
universal image, "just as in the routed army one man must stand so as 
to become the center round which others may group themselves."<sup><small><a name="n87"><a href="#n_87">{87}</a></a></small></sup><p>

It is evident, therefore, that while the intellect does not create the 
concept, it is active in causing the object to become actually 
intelligible. There is, however, a subsequent stage in the process. 
Once the object is rendered intelligible, it impresses itself on the 
intellect in precisely the same way as the sensible object impresses 
its <i>species</i> on the senses. The intellect in this second stage of 
the process is called the <i>passive intellect</i> (<b>nous 
path&ecirc;tikos</b>), while in the first stage of the process it is 
called <b>to poioun</b>. It is worthy of remark that although it is 
usual to speak of the <i>active and passive intellect</i>, Aristotle 
never speaks of a <b>nous poi&ecirc;tikos</b>, always designating the 
active intellect by means of the present participle.<p>

From this it is clear that in Aristotle's psychology there is no room for 
the doctrine of <i>innate ideas</i>, All knowledge comes through the 
senses, nothing being innate in the mind except the native power of the 
active intellect by which it discovers in 
 <!--
ARISTOTLE'S PSVCHOLOGY 151 
 --><A NAME="p151"></a>
 the concrete and individual the abstract and universal elements of 
thought contained therein. But what is this active intellect? What is 
its relation to the <b>psuch&ecirc;</b>, the vita] principle in man? 
These are questions which have vexed the commentators and interpreters 
of Aristotle from the days of Theophrastus down to our own time. There 
is even greater difficulty in determining what Aristotle meant by the 
passive intellect. Where there is so complex a diversity of opinion it 
is perhaps hazardous to classify interpretations; still, it seems that 
the commentators and interpreters may be included under the heads 
<i>Transcendentalists</i> and <i>Anthropologists</i>. Eudemus, 
Alexander of Aphrodisias, the Arabians of the Middle Ages, and most 
modern commentators since the time of Hegel understand the active 
intellect to mean something apart from, or transcending in some way, 
the individual soul, while as to the nature of the passive intellect 
they are in a state of hopeless confusion. Theophrastus, Philoponus, 
Themistius, Simplicius, Boethius, and the greater number of the 
schoolmen, understand the active intellect to mean a faculty of the 
individual soul; while many of the schoolmen identify the passive 
intellect with the active, making the difference between the two powers 
to consist merely in a difference between two phases of the same 
faculty. It will be sufficient here to give the words in which 
Aristotle describes the active intellect, without entering into the 
question of interpretation. He speaks, in <i>De Anima</i>, III, 4, 429 
a, of the intellect as <i>separate and unmixed</i>; in the following 
chapter<sup><small><a name="n88"><a href="#n_88">{88}</a></a></small></sup> he describes he active intellect as being <i>"alone 
separate, eternal, and immortal"</i> (430 a), and in <i>De Generatione 
Animalium</i> II, 3, 736 b, 28, 
 <!--
152 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p152"></a>
 he describes it as coming from without (<b>thurathen</b>), and as 
<i>divine</i> (<b>theion</b>). It must, however, be borne in mind that 
the chapters in which Aristotle enunciates his theory of knowledge are 
of a fragmentary nature, and, moreover, that this portion of 
Aristotle's psychological treatise deals with a question which no 
modern school with the exception of the transcendentalist school has 
attempted to solve. It is, therefore, not a matter for surprise that in 
expounding Aristotle so many modern writers have fallen into the error 
of interpreting him in the terminology of transcendentalism, thus 
illustrating the adage, "Aristotelem nonnisi ex ipso Aristotele 
intelliges."<sup><small><a name="n89"><a href="#n_89">{89}</a></a></small></sup><p>

By reason of its intellectual function, which it performs without 
intrinsic dependence on the bodily organism, and by which it transcends 
the conditions of matter, the soul is <i>immaterial</i><sup><small><a name="n90"><a href="#n_90">{90}</a></a></small></sup> and 
<i>immortal</i>.<sup><small><a name="n91"><a href="#n_91">{91}</a></a></small></sup> Aristotle's doctrine of immortality is, however, 
conditioned by his doctrine of the active intellect. If the active 
intellect is something separate from the individual soul, an impersonal 
intellect, common to all men, -- and this is the interpretation 
followed by Alexander, by the Arabians, and by many modern scholars, -- 
it does not appear how Aristotle could hold that the soul is in any 
true sense of the word endowed with personal immortality.<p>

With regard to <i>will</i>, in place of Plato's vague, unsatisfactory 
notion of <b>thumos</b>, we find the definite concept of 
<b>boul&ecirc;sis</b> which may be described as a consilience of reason 
and desire. Will is rational appetite; it is the desire of good as 
apprehended by reason,<sup><small><a name="n92"><a href="#n_92">{92}</a></a></small></sup> and because it is preceded by a rational 
apprehension  
 <!--
ARISTOTLE'S PRACTICAL PHILOSOPHY 153
 --><A NAME="p153"></a>
 of good, it is <i>free</i>. This view of <i>freedom of choice</i> 
(<b>proairesis</b>) is supported by the recognized voluntariness of 
virtue, and by the equally well recognized fact that man is held 
accountable for his actions.<sup><small><a name="n93"><a href="#n_93">{93}</a></a></small></sup> Reason in its function of suggesting 
the best means by which an end is to be attained is called 
<i>practical</i>.<p>

Before proceeding, however, to treat of ethics, which is the science of 
human conduct according to the principles of practical reason, it is 
necessary to mention the last division of theoretical philosophy, 
namely, mathematics.<p>

c. <b>Mathematics</b> deals with immovable being, thus differing from 
physics, which has for object being subject to motion.<sup><small><a name="n94"><a href="#n_94">{94}</a></a></small></sup> It differs from 
metaphysics in this, that it deals with corporeal being under the 
determination of quantity, while metaphysics has for its object being 
in general, under its highest determinations, such as act and 
potency, cause and effect.<sup><small><a name="n95"><a href="#n_95">{95}</a></a></small></sup><p>

C <b>Practical Philosophy</b> includes the science of political 
government and organization as well as the general questions of moral 
science.<p>

1. <i>The supreme good</i> of man is happiness. Of this no Greek had 
the least doubt. The word <b>eudaimonia</b> has, however, more of an 
objective meaning than our word <i>happiness</i>: It is more akin to 
<i>well-being</i> or <i>welfare</i>. But how is this well-being to be 
attained? What is it that constitutes happiness? happiness is 
determined by the end for which man was made, md the end of human 
existence is that form of good which is peculiar to man, the good which 
is proper to a rational being. Now, reason is the prerogative of man. 
It should, therefore, be the aim of man's existence to live conformably 
to reason, -- to live a life of <i>virtue</i>.<sup><small><a name="n96"><a href="#n_96">{96}</a></a></small></sup> Nevertheless, 
Aristotle would not include wealth and pleasure from the idea of human 
happiness; for wealth is necessary for the external manifestation of 
virtue, and pleasure is the natural reward of a virtuous life. 
Happiness 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 154
 --><A NAME="p154"></a>
 also includes friendship, health, -- in a word, all the gifts of 
fortune.<sup><small><a name="n97"><a href="#n_97">{97}</a></a></small></sup><p>

2. <i>Virtue</i>, while it is not the only constituent of happiness, is 
the indispensable means of attaining happiness. It is not a mere 
feeling, but rather a fixed quality or habit of mind (<b>hexis</b>).  
Now, mind must first of all hold the lower functions, and especially 
the passions, in subjection, and then it must develop its own powers. 
Thus, we have moral virtue and intellectual virtue.<p>

(a) <i>Moral virtue is a certain habit of the faculty of choice, 
consisting in a mean</i> (<b>mesot&ecirc;s</b>) <i>suitable to our 
nature and fixed by reason in the manner in which a prudent man would 
fix it</i>.<sup><small><a name="n98"><a href="#n_98">{98}</a></a></small></sup> It is a habit, -- that is, a fixed quality. It consists 
in a mean between excess and defect. Courage, for example, preserves 
the mean between cowardice and reckless daring. Virtue, it is true, is 
impossible without moral insight. Still, we must not identify these two 
as Socrates did when he reduced all virtue to knowledge. There are many 
kinds of virtue, for virtue is a quality of the will, and the defects 
and excesses to which the will may lead us are many, as will be seen by 
the following schema:<p>

ARISTOTLE'S POLITICAL DOCTRINES 155 
 --><A NAME="p155"></a><p>

<i>Justice</i> (<b>dikaiosun&ecirc;</b>) in its generic meaning 
signifies the observance of the right order of all the faculties of 
man, and in this sense it is synonymous with virtue. In a more 
restricted sense, justice is the virtue which regulates man's dealings 
with his fellow-man. It is divided into <i>distributive, corrective</i>, and 
<i>commutative</i> justice.<sup><small><a name="n100"><a href="#n_100">{100}</a></a></small></sup><p>

(b) <i>The intellectual virtues</i> are perfections of the intellect 
itself, without relation to the other faculties. We have (i) the 
perfections of the scientific reason, namely, <i>understanding</i> 
(<b>nous</b>) <i>science</i> (<b>epist&ecirc;m&ecirc;</b>), and 
<i>wisdom</i> (<b>sophia</b>), which are respectively concerned with 
first principles, demonstration, and the search for highest causes; and 
(2) the perfections of the practical reason, namely, <i>art</i>, which 
is referred to <i>external</i> actions (<b>poiein</b>), and 
<i>practical wisdom</i>, which is referred to actions the excellence of 
which depends on no external result (<b>prattein</b>).<sup><small><a name="n101"><a href="#n_101">{101}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The most characteristic of Aristotle's ethical teachings is the 
superiority which he assigns to intellectual over ethical virtue, and 
the most serious defect in his ethical system is his failure to refer 
human action to future reward and punishment.<p>

3. In his <i>political doctrines</i> Aristotle starts with the 
principle that man is by nature a social being (<b>politikon 
z&ocirc;on</b>), and is forced to depend on the social organization for 
the attainment of happiness. Man's social life begins in the family; 
for the family is prior to the state. The state is consequently bound 
to keep the family intact, and, in general, its mission is the 
advancement and development of its subjects, -- the lifting up of the 
people by the just administration of law to a higher plane of moral 
conduct.<sup><small><a name="n102"><a href="#n_102">{102}</a></a></small></sup> Aristotle combats the <i>state absolutism</i> of Plato.<p>

There are three ultimate <i>forms of government</i>, -- monarchy, 
aristocracy, and the republic. The best form of government is  
 <!--
156 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p156"></a>
 that which is best suited to the character of the people 
(<i>Politica</i>, III, 17). Thus, although monarchy is the ideal, the 
best attainable form seems to be an aristocracy, not of wealth nor of 
birth but of intellect, -- a true aristocracy, a government of the 
best.<sup><small><a name="n103"><a href="#n_103">{103}</a></a></small></sup><p>

D. <b>Poietical Philosophy</b>. Under this head Aristotle treats the 
theory of art. Art, he teaches, is traceable to the spirit of 
imitation, and consists in the realization in external form of the true 
idea, -- a realization which is not limited to mere copying, but 
extends also to the perfecting of the deficiencies of nature by 
grouping the individual phenomena under the universal type.<sup><small><a name="n104"><a href="#n_104">{104}</a></a></small></sup> History 
merely copies; poetry idealizes and completes the work of history: 
Poetry is more philosophical and more elevated than history.<sup><small><a name="n105"><a href="#n_105">{105}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Aristotle's analysis of the beautiful is, like Plato's, confined to a 
study of the objective constituents of beauty. These he reduces to 
order and grandeur, which are found especially in moral beauty. So 
vague and indefinite is this analysis that Aristotle was obliged, as we 
have seen, to base his theory of art on the realization of the essence, 
without referring art at all to the notion of the beautiful. The aim of 
art is the calming, purifying, and ennobling of the affections.<sup><small><a name="n106"><a href="#n_106">{106}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. It is difficult to form a true estimate of 
Aristotle's philosophy, and the difficulty arises, strange as this may 
seem, from our too great familiarity with many of the notions which 
Aristotle introduced into human science. The basic ideas of his 
philosophical system have become the commonplaces of elementary 
education; they have found their way into the vocabulary of our 
everyday life, and have impressed themselves indelibly on the 
literature of Western civilization.  
 <!--
ESTIMATE OF ARISTOTLE'S PHILOSOPHY 157 
 --><A NAME="p157"></a>
 The terminology, the invention of which is one of Aristotle's chief 
titles to preeminence, has become indissolubly associated with the 
exposition of Christian theology, and forms, so to speak, the alphabet 
of our catechetical instructions. All this has made it difficult for 
the modern reader to appreciate the importance of Aristotle's 
contributions to philosophy. <i>Consueta vilescunt!</i> It is 
necessary, therefore, to forget how familiar many of Aristotle's 
discoveries have become, to go back in imagination to the time when 
they were first enunciated, and in this way to realize, if we can, the 
breadth and depth of a mind that could succeed in accomplishing such a 
vast amount original work as to entitle him to be considered the 
founder of logic, the author of the first treatise on scientific 
psychology, the first natural historian, and the father of the 
biological sciences.  Placing ourselves at this point of view, we shall 
be less inclined to single out the undeniable defects of Aristotle's 
philosophy, finding it a more natural as well as a more congenial to 
compare Aristotle with his predecessors in the history of Greek 
speculation.<p>

Aristotle's philosophy is the synthesis and culmination of the 
speculations of pre-Socratic and Socratic schools. His doctrine of 
causes is an epitome of all that Greek philosophy had up to time 
accomplished. But it is especially with Plato, his masr, that Aristotle 
is to be compared, and it is by his additions Platonic teaching that he 
is to be judged. Plato built out of the ruins of pre-Socratic 
speculation a complete metaphysical structure according to a definite 
plan, -- a structure beautiful in outlines, perfect in its symmetry, 
but insecure and unstable, like one of those golden palaces of 
fairyland, which we fear to approach and examine lest it vanish into 
airy nothingness. Aristotle, on the contrary, drew his plan with a 
firmer hand; he laid the foundation of his philosophy deep on the rock 
bottom experience, and although all the joints in the fabric are not 
equally secure, the care and consistency with which the design 
 <!--
158 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p158"></a><A NAME="p158"></a>
 is executed are apparent to every observer. It was left for Scholastic 
philosophy to add the pinnacle to the structure which Aristotle had 
carried as far towards completion as human thought could build unaided. 
If Plato has been called the Sublime, Aristotle must be called the 
Profound, a title which, when applied to a philosopher, should be the 
expression of higher praise; for<p>

<a name="n_88"><a href="#n88">{88}</a></a> Wallace (<i>Aristotle's Psychology</i>, p. cvi) says that "the 
stumb]ing-block which has prevented students from understanding 
Aristotle's position lies perhaps chiefly in separating the fourth and 
fifth chapters of the third book (<i>De Anima</i>) from each other, as 
if Aristotle were speaking of one reason in one chapter and of another 
in the other." <i>cf.</i> also <i>ibid.</i>, pp. cvii ff.; Brentano,
