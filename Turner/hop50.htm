ITALIAN PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE</h3><p>

This school is characterized by naturalism and a tendency towards 
pantheism. <b>Cardano</b> (1501-1576), a Milanese physician, was the 
first to formulate the principles of modern naturalism. These 
principles were reduced to a system of speculative thought by the 
Calabrian Bernardino <b>Telesio</b> (1508-1588), who is, therefore, 
regarded as the founder of the school. In his work <i>De Rerum Natura 
juxta Propria Principia</i>, he advocates the use of the empirical 
method of investigating nature, and formulates a system according to 
which the universe results from the combination of three principles, 
mailer, heat, and cold. <b>Patrizzi</b> (1529-1597), in his <i>Nova de 
Universis Philosophia</i>, combined the doctrines of Neo-Platonism with the 
naturalism of Telesio, and thus imparted to the school its pantheistic 
tendency. These pantheistic principles reached their logical 
development in the full-blown systems of pantheism of Bruno and 
Campanella.

GIORDANO BRUNO<p>

<b>Life</b>. Giordano Bruno was born at Nola, in Campania, in the year 
1548. At an early age he entered the order of St. Dominic, but his 
distaste for Scholasticism and his enthusiasm for the writings of 
Telesio developed before long a spirit of dissatisfaction with his 
order and with the teachings of the Church. Discarding the garb of 
religion, he wandered through Italy, France, England, and Germany, and 
is said finally to have joined the reformed Church. Apparently, 
however, he found Protestantism as distasteful as the religion he had 
abandoned. Returning to Italy (1592), he was arrested by the 
Inquisition at Venice, and was burned at the stake in Rome in the year 
1600. His principal works are <i>Della causa, principio, ed uno</i> and 
<i>Del infinito universo e dei mondi</i>.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Bruno's philosophy is a system of naturalistic <i>pantheism</i>: its 
pivotal thoughts are the doctrine of the identity of God with the world 
and the Copernican idea of the physical universe.<p>

God, he teaches, is identical with the universe, for the universe is 
infinite, and there cannot be two infinities. God is, therefore, the 
sum of all being, and the phenomena, or accidental forms of being, 
which exist, are merely the unfolding (<i>explicatio</i>) of the 
immensity of God. He is the <i>original matter</i> of the universe (and 
on this point Bruno cites the authority of David of Dinant), as well as 
the primitive form, the <i>world-soul</i>, which vivifies the original 
matter. Indeed these two, matter and form, not only interpenetrate each 
other, but are absolutely identical. God is also the final cause of all 
things; for to Him, the God-universe, all things are constantly 
returning.<p>

The <i>universe is</i>, therefore, <i>essentially one</i>: the 
Aristotelian distinction between celestial and terrestrial matter can 
no longer be maintained. The stars are part of our solar system, or are 
themselves suns surrounded by planets and forming part of the  
 <!--

 one great system which is the universe. It is in this portion of his 
philosophy that Bruno makes use of the discoveries of Copernicus.<p>

<i>The universe is ruled by law</i>: there is no place for human 
freedom in this system of determinism. The soul is an emanation from 
the Divine Universe, and all organisms are composed of living monads 
each of which reflects all reality.<p>

TOMMASO CAMPANELLA<p>

<b>Life</b>. Tommaso Campanella was born in Calabria in the year 1568. 
In 1583 he entered the order of St. Dominic. Arrested on suspicion of 
conspiring against the Spanish rule, he was cast into a dungeon at 
Naples. After spending twenty-seven years in prison he escaped to 
Paris, where he died in 1639. His most important work is <i>Universalis 
Philosophia</i>.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Campanella's philosophy is the resultant of various influences, chief 
among which are the naturalism of Telesio, the Greek Pyrrhonism 
restored by the humanists, and the enthusiasm for the study of nature 
which resulted from the discoveries made by Copernicus and Galileo.<p>

Campanella starts by inquiring into the conditions of knowledge. The 
veracity of the external senses rests on the testimony of the inner 
sense. On this inner sense rests also the belief in my own existence 
and in the existence of God. The inner sense testifies, moreover, to 
the existence of three functions in my own soul, -- <i>power, 
knowledge</i>, and <i>volition</i>. By thinking away the limitations of 
the power, knowledge, and volition, of which I am conscious, I arrive 
at an idea of an Infinite Being possessed of <i>omnipotence, infinite 
wisdom</i>, and <i>infinite love</i>. These three are, then, the
 "pro-principles" of infinite being: they are also the pro-principles 
of created being. For all creatures are endowed with life, feeling, 
and desire: they all proceed from 
 <!--
TOMMASO CAMPANELLA 431 
 --><A NAME="p431"></a>
 God and they desire to return to Him, as is evident from the 
universality of the creature's dread of annihilation. This desire of 
the creature to return to the Creator is a kind of religion, and so far 
is atheism from being true that the most universal of all phenomena is 
the religious tendency by which every created being proclaims the 
existence of God. This thought is developed by Campanella in a treatise 
entitled <i>Atheismus Triumphatus</i>.<p>

In the <i>Civitas Solis</i> Campanella outlines his ideal scheme of 
political government. The scheme is based on the idea of the divine 
government of the world communicated through the papacy to a
 world-monarchy and through this to the individual kingdoms, provinces, 
and cities.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The Italian school of natural philosophy 
resulted from the repudiation of Scholasticism by the humanists and the 
inauguration, by scientific discoveries, of a new era of nature-study. 
The extraordinary enthusiasm with which the contemporaries of 
Copernicus and Galileo addressed themselves to the study of natural 
phenomena is seen in the naturalistic pantheism of the Italian school 
no less clearly than in the extravagance of the Paracelsists and others 
who devoted themselves to the occult sciences and the practice of 
magic. But whatever may be said of the occultists and magicians, it is 
certain that the scientific discoveries would never have led to 
naturalism and pantheism if the principles of Scholastic philosophy had 
not fallen into discredit. Let us pass, therefore, to the study of the 
scientific movement and its influence on Scholastic philosophy.<p>
