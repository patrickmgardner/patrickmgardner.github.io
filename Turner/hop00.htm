INTRODUCTION</h2><p>

THE History of Philosophy is the exposition of philosophical opinions 
and of systems and schools of philosophy. It includes the study of the 
lives of philosophers, the inquiry into the mutual connection of 
schools and systems of thought, and the attempt to trace the course of 
philosophical progress or retrogression. The nature and scope of 
philosophy furnish reasons for the study of its history. Philosophy 
does not confine its investigation to one or to several departments of 
knowledge; it is concerned with the ultimate principles and laws of all 
things. Every science has for its aim to find the causes of phenomena; 
philosophy seeks to discover ultimate causes, thus carrying to a higher 
plane the unifying process begun in the lower sciences. The vastness of 
the field of inquiry, the difficulty of synthesizing the results of 
scientific investigation, and the constantly increasing complexity of 
these results necessitated the gradual development of philosophy. To 
each generation and to each individual the problems of philosophy 
present themselves anew, and the influences, personal, racial, 
climatic, social, and religious, which bear on the generation or on the 
individual must be studied in order that the meaning and value of each 
doctrine and system be understood and appreciated. Such influences are 
more than a matter of mere erudition; they have their place in the 
<i>praenotanda</i> to the solution of every important question 
 <!--
2 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p2"></a>
 in philosophy; for, as Coleridge says, "the very fact that any 
doctrine has been believed by thoughtful men is part of the problem to 
be solved, is one of the phenomena to be accounted for." Moreover, 
philosophical doctrines, while they are to be regarded primarily as 
contributions to truth, are also to be studied as vital forces which 
have determined to a large extent the literary, artistic, political, 
and industrial life of the world. To-day, more than ever, it is clearly 
understood that without a knowledge of these forces it is impossible to 
comprehend the inner movements of thought which alone explain the outer 
actions of men and nations.<p>

The dangers to be avoided in the study of the history of philosophy are 
<i>Eclecticism</i>, which teaches that all systems are equally true, 
and <i>Scepticism</i>, which teaches that all systems are equally 
false. A careful study of the course of philosophical speculation will 
result in the conviction that, while no single school can lay claim to 
the entire truth, certain schools of thought have adopted that
 world-concept which can be most consistently applied to every 
department of knowledge. False systems of philosophy may stumble on 
many important truths, but a right concept of the ultimate meaning of 
reality and a correct notion of philosophic method are the essentials 
for which we must look in every system; these constitute a legitimate 
standard of valuation by which the student of the history of philosophy 
may judge each successive contribution to philosophical science.<p>

The <i>method</i> to be followed in this study is the empirical, or 
<i>a posteriori</i>, method, which is employed in all historical 
research. The speculative, or <i>a priori</i>, method consists in 
laying down a principle, such as the Hegelian principle that the 
succession of schools and systems corresponds to the succession of 
logical categories, and deducing from such a principle the actual 
succession of schools and systems. But, apart from the danger of 
misstating facts for the sake of methodic symmetry, such a  
 <!--
INTRODUCTION 3
 --><A NAME="p3"></a>
 procedure must be judged to be philosophically unsound; for systems 
of philosophy, like facts of general history, are contingent events. 
There are, indeed, laws of historical development; but such laws are to 
be established subsequently, not anteriorly, to the study of the facts 
of history.<p>

The historian of philosophy, therefore, has for his task: (1) To set 
forth the lives and doctrines of philosophers and systems and schools 
of philosophy in their historical relation. This, the <i>recitative</i> 
or <i>narrative</i> portion of the historian's task, includes the 
critical examination of sources. (2) To trace the genetic connection 
between systems, schools, and doctrines, and to estimate the value of 
each successive contribution to philosophy. This, the 
<i>philosophical</i> portion of the historian's task, is by far the 
most important of his duties: <i>Potius de rebus ipsis judicare 
debemus, quam pro magno de hominibus quid quisque senserit 
scire</i>.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The <i>sources</i> of the history of philosophy are: (1) <i>Primary 
sources</i>, namely, the works, complete or fragmentary, of 
philosophers. It is part of the historian's task to establish, whenever 
necessary, the <i>authenticity</i> and <i>integrity</i> of these works. 
(2) <i>Secondary sources</i>, that is, the narration or testimony of 
other persons concerning the lives, opinions, and doctrines of 
philosophers. In dealing with secondary sources the rules of 
historical criticism must be applied, in order to determine the 
<i>reliability</i> of witnesses.<p>

The <i>division</i> of the history of philosophy will always be more or 
less arbitrary in matters of detail. This is owing to the continuity of 
historical development: the stream of human thought flows continuously 
from one generation to another; like all human institutions, systems 
and schools of philosophy never break entirely with the past; they 
arise and succeed one another without abrupt transition and merge into 
one another so imperceptibly that it is rarely possible to decide where 
one ends and 
 <!--
4 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p4"></a>
 another begins. The more general divisions, however, are determined by 
great historical events and by obvious national and geographical 
distinctions. Thus, the coming of Christ divides the History of 
Philosophy into two parts, each of which may be subdivided as follows:<p>

ORIENTAL PHILOSOPHY</h2><p>

IN the doctrines by means of which the Babylonians, Chinese, Hindus, 
Egyptians, and other Oriental peoples sought to formulate their 
thoughts concerning the origin of the universe and the nature and 
destiny of man, the religious element predominates over the natural or 
rational explanation. An adequate account of these doctrines belongs, 
therefore, to the History of Religions rather than to the History of 
Philosophy. While, however, this is so, and while the task of 
separating the religious from the philosophical element of thought in 
the Oriental systems of speculation is by no means easy, some account 
of these systems must be given before we pass to the study of Western 
thought.<p>

When, probably about the year 3800 B.C., the Semites conquered 
Babylonia, they found there a civilization which is 
 <!--
8 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p8"></a>
 commonly called that of the Accadians and Sumerians, and is by many 
regarded as the source of all the civilizations of the East. The 
religion of the Accadians was originally Shamanistic: every object, 
every force in nature, was believed to possess a spirit (<i>Zi</i>) who 
could be controlled by the magical exorcisms of the Shaman, or 
sorcerer-priest.<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> Gradually certain of these spirits had been elevated 
to the dignity of gods, as, for instance, <i>Anu</i> (the sky),
 <i>Mul-ge</i>, or <i>Enum</i> (the earth), and <i>Hea</i> (the deep). 
It was not, however, until the time of Assurbanipal (seventh century 
B.C.) that this primitive system of theogony began to develop into a 
system of cosmogony based on the idea that the universe arose out of a 
chaos of waters. Before that time, there prevailed in Accadia a vague 
traditional belief that the present cosmic system was preceded by an 
anarchical chaos in which there existed composite creatures, -- men 
with the bodies of birds and the tails of fishes, -- Nature's first 
attempts at creation. With this creationist legend was associated an 
equally vague belief in a gloomy Hades, or underworld, where the 
spirits of the dead hover like bats and feed on dust.<p>

From the earliest times the Accadians devoted attention to the 
observation of the heavenly bodies, and it may be said that among them 
Astronomy found its first home. Their crude attempts at astronomical 
observations were, however, connected with astrological practices, so 
that the Chaldaeans became famous among the ancients as adepts in the 
magic arts: <i>Chaldaeos ne consulito</i>. In like manner, the first 
efforts at numerical computation and notation were made subservient to 
the demands of the magician.<p>

It was through the Phoenicians, who inaugurated the trade of western 
Asia, that the civilization of the Assyrians influenced the religious 
and artistic life of the Greeks and of the other nations of the 
Mediterranean.

<hr align="center"><p><a name="Egypt"></a>  
<h3 align="center">EGYPT<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

Up to the present time Egyptologists have failed to reach an agreement 
as to what was the primitive form of religious belief in ancient Egypt. 
In the first place, the chronological difficulties have hitherto proved 
to be insurmountable; and in the next place, the diversity of religious 
systems in the different <i>nomes</i>, provinces, into which ancient 
Egypt was divided, renders difficult every attempt at forming a theory 
as to what, if any, was the one religion which prevailed throughout 
Egypt at the dawn of history. Historians are content with dating the 
period the seventh century B.C. by dynasties rather than by years, the 
first dynasty being placed about the fifty-fifth century B.C. Menes, 
who established the first dynasty, found already a hierarchical system 
of deities, to each of whom some city was dedicated. But what was the 
primitive religion Egypt, from which this hierarchical system of gods 
was evolved? <i>Monotheism, Polytheism, Pantheism, Henotheism, 
Totemism, Sun-Worship, Nature-Worship</i>,  -- these are the widely 
different answers which modern Egyptologists have given to question.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> 
Scholars are equally at variance as to the origin and significance of 
<i>Animal-Worship</i> among the Egyptians. When, however, we come to 
the period of the great gods, chief whom were <i>Ra</i> (the sun), 
<i>Nut</i> (heaven), and <i>Set</i>, or <i>Typhon</i> (the earth), and 
to the legends of <i>Osiris</i>, <i>Isis</i>, and <i>Horus</i>, there 
seems to be very little room for doubt as to the essentially 
naturalistic character of these divinities. "The kernel of the Egyptian 
state religion was solar."<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup><p>

With regard to the <i>speculative elements</i> of thought contained in 
the mythological conceptions of the Egyptians, mention must 
 <!--
10 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p10"></a>
 be made of the doctrine that everything living, whether it was a god, 
a man, or an animal, possessed a <i>Ka</i>, or "shadow," which was in 
each case more real and permanent than the object itself. This notion 
was present in the practice of animal worship; for, although there is 
by no means a unanimity of opinion among scholars in favor of reducing 
animal worship to mere symbolism, there is no doubt that the Egyptian 
mind was dominated by the idea that every <i>Ka</i> must have a 
material dwelling place. Similarly, when the abstract notion of the 
divinity presented itself to the Egyptian mind and was identified with 
each god in turn, and when, at a later time, there appeared the notion 
of a pantheistic divinity in whom all the great gods were merged, the 
dominant idea was always that of the <i>Ka</i> or soul, whose dwelling 
place was the individual god or the universe. Another conception which 
may be traced very far back in the history of Egyptian civilization is 
that of <i>the magical virtue of names</i>.<p>

The idea of "shadow" and the belief in the magical virtue of names 
determined the Egyptian <i>cult of the dead</i> and the <i>doctrine of 
immortality</i>. From the monuments and the relics of ancient Egyptian 
literature, especially from the <i>Book of the Dead</i>,<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> it is clear 
that deep down in the popular mind was the belief that the continued 
existence of a person after death depended some how on the preservation 
of his name and on the permanence of the dwelling place which was to 
harbor his <i>Ka</i>, or shadow. Hence, the Egyptians considered that 
the houses of the living were merely inns, and that the tombs of the 
dead are eternal habitations. In the philosophical traditions of the 
priestly caste there grew up a more rational doctrine of the future 
life. According to this doctrine, man consists of three parts, the 
<i>Khat</i>, or body, the <i>Khu</i>, or spirit, which is an emanation 
from the divine essence, and the soul, which is sometimes represented 
as a <i>Ka</i> dwelling in the mummy or in the statue of the deceased, 
 <!--
EGYPT 11
 --><A NAME="p11"></a>
 and sometimes as a <i>Ba</i>, or disembodied soul, which ultimately 
returns to its home in the lower world.<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> It is this <i>Ba</i>, or 
disembodied soul, which after death appears before Osiris and the 
 forty-two judges, and is weighed in the balance by Horus and Anubis 
while Thoth records the result. The souls of the blessed are eventually 
admitted to the happy fields of Aalu, there to be purified from all 
earthly stain and made more perfect wisdom and goodness. The souls of 
the wicked are condemned either to the various torments of hell, or to 
wanderings long and arduous through the regions between heaven and earth, 
or to transmigration into the bodies of various animals, or, finally, to 
annihilation. The fate of the soul is determined partly by the good and 
evil which it wrought during life and partly by the amulets, prayers, 
and gifts by which it secured the favor of the gods. But whatever may be 
the immediate fate of the soul, it will ultimately return to its body, 
and on the great day of resurrection soul, body, and spirit shall be 
once more united.<p>

From the chapter on Judgment in the Book of the Dead and from the 
<i>Ethical Maxims of Kakimma</i> (third dynasty) and <i>Ptah-Hotep</i> 
(fifth dynasty) it appears that the ideal of conduct among the ancient 
Egyptians was practical, of a high order of purity, and essentially 
religious. In these documents charity, benevolence, prudence, chastity, 
social justice, clemency, and the love of intellectual pursuits are 
ranked among the foremost virtues. And not only external morality is 
inculcated but also be morality of thought and desire.

<hr align="center"><p><a name="China"></a>  
<h3 align="center">CHINA<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

When, about 2000 years B.C., the Chinese first appeared in the light of 
history, they already possessed social, political, and religious 
institutions and a material and intellectual civilization of a high 
order. It was not, however, until the sixth century B.C. that the 
sacred books were collected and arranged, although some of them, 
especially the Y-king, were assigned by tradition to the learned 
princes and kings who, long before the historical period, had invented 
the art of writing. The sacred or authoritative books were:<p>

I. The <i>Five Classics</i>, namely, the <i>Y-king</i>, or Book of 
Changes (divination); the <i>Shu-king</i>, or Book of History; the 
<i>Shi-king</i> , or Book of Poetry; the <i>Le-ke</i>, or Record of 
Rites; and the <i>Chun-tsew</i>, Spring and Autumn, a Book of Annals, 
composed by Confucius.<p>

II. The <i>Four Books</i>, namely, <i>Lun-yu</i>, or Conversations of 
the Master; <i>Chun-yung</i>, or Doctrine of the Mean; <i>Ta-heo</i>, 
or Great Learning; and <i>Meng-tse</i>, or Teachings of Mencius.<p>

The Five Classics were collected, arranged, and edited by Confucius 
(with the exception of the last, which was written by him), and it is 
impossible to say to what extent the editor introduced into the text 
doctrines and opinions of his own. The Four Books were composed by 
disciples of Confucius.<p>

Before the time of Confucius there existed a national or state religion 
in which the principal objects of worship were <i>heaven</i>, and 
<i>spirits</i> of various kinds, especially the <i>spirits of dead 
ancestors</i>. Heaven (<i>Thian</i>) is the supreme lord
 (<i>Shang-ti</i>), the highest object of worship.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup> The deity 
carries on its work      
 <!--
CHINA 13 
 --><A NAME="p13"></a>
 silently and simply, yet inexorably, in the order and succession of 
natural phenomena, in the rain and the sunshine, the heat and the cold, 
etc. With this natural order are closely connected the social, 
political, and moral orders of the world; or rather, all order is 
essentially one, and perfection and prosperity in moral life and in the 
state depend on maintaining the order which is not only heaven's first 
law, but heaven itself. With the worship of heaven was connected the 
worship of spirits (<i>Shan</i>). These are omnipresent throughout 
nature; they are not, however, addressed as individuals, but as a body 
or aggregation of individuals, as, for example, celestial spirits, 
terrestrial spirits, and ancestral spirits. The last are the object of 
private as distinct from official worship. The Chinese, always inclined 
to look towards the past rather than towards the future, thought less 
of personal immortality in the life after death than of the 
continuation of the family life by which the actions of the individual 
were reflected back and made to ennoble a whole of line ancestors.<p>

The qualities which characterized the religious thought of from the 
beginning  --  its eminently practical nature, the complete absence of 
speculation, and the almost complete exclusion of mythological elements 
-- reappear in the writings of the great religious teacher 
<b>Confucius</b> (<i>Kong-tse</i>, 551-478 B.C.). Confucius was no 
innovator; he appeared, rather, as the collector of the sacred 
literature of the past and the restorer of the old order. He inculcated 
the strict observance of the traditional forms of worship, discouraged 
speculation in matters theological, and while he taught the supreme 
importance of moral duties, he grounded all his moral precepts on the 
general order of the world and the long-established tradition of the 
Chinese people. He insisted on man's political and domestic duties and 
emphasized especially the importance of <i>filial piety</i>.<p>

<i>Lao-tse</i>, a Contemporary of Confucius (born about 604 B.C.), and 
author of the Tao-te-king, introduced into China the first 
 <!--
14 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p14"></a>
 system of speculative thought, the philosophy of <i>Tao</i> (Reason, 
Way), which many scholars consider to be of Hindu origin.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> Lao-tse 
did not, however, attempt to overthrow the traditional ideals of his 
countrymen, and, while the importance which he attaches to speculation 
places him in sharp contrast with Confucius, the doctrines of the two 
great teachers have many points in common. For <i>Tao</i>, the 
fundamental concept of the <i>Tao-te-king</i>, does not mean Reason in 
the abstract, but Nature, or rather, the Way, -- the order of the 
world, the impersonal method which all men must observe if they are to 
attain goodness and success. Ultimately, then, both Lao-tse and 
Confucius teach that conduct is to be guided by a knowledge of the 
unalterable, discriminating, intelligent order of heaven and earth; but 
while Confucius refers his disciples to the study of the writings and 
institutions of antiquity, Lao-tse refers them to the speculative 
contemplation of <i>Tao</i>: the former encourages study, the latter 
advocates contemplation, as a means of acquiring a knowledge of the 
eternal order on which morality depends. Hence, the tendency of Taoism 
towards quietism and self-abnegation. "Recompense injury with 
kindness," said Lao-tse; to which Confucius is said to have answered, 
"Recompense kindness with kindness, but recompense injury with 
justice."<p>

To the fifth century B.C. belong <b>Yang-tse</b> and <b>Nih-tse</b> (or 
<i>Mak</i>). The former preached a kind of Epicureanism: man should 
enjoy the present and cheerfully accept death when it comes; virtue is 
but a name; good reputation is a shadow; the sacrifice of self is a 
delusion. The latter maintained that one should love all men equally, 
that the practice of universal love is a greater benefit to the state 
than the study of antiquity and the preservation of ancient 
customs.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Lih-tse</b> and <b>Chwang-tse</b> appeared during the fifth and the 
first half of the fourth centuries B.C. as representatives of Taoism.
 <!--
INDIA 15  
 --><A NAME="p15"></a>
 They were opposed by the distinguished exponent of Confucianism, 
<i>Meng-tse</i> or Mencius (371-288). In his dialogues, which were 
collected in seven books by his disciples, he gives a more compact 
exposition of Confucianism than that found in the isolated sayings of 
the master. He insists on filial piety, on political virtue, and on the 
proper observance of religious and other ceremonial rites. He reduces 
the cardinal virtues to four: <i>Wisdom, Humanity, Justice</i>, and 
<i>Propriety</i>.<p>

<hr align="center"><p><a name="India"></a>  
<h3 align="center">INDIA<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

The <i>Veda</i>, or collection of primitive religious literature of the 
Hindus, consists of books of sacred hymns, the <i>Rig-Veda</i>, the 
<i>S&acirc;ma-Veda</i>, the <i>Yagur-Veda</i>, and the <i>Atharva-
Veda</i>. In each it is usual to distinguish the <i>Mantras</i>, or 
hymns, the <i>Br&acirc;hmanas</i>, or ritualistic commentaries, and the 
<i>Upanishads</i>, or philosophical commentaries.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup><p>

The Vedic hymns, which are the oldest portion of the Veda (1500 B.C. 
being the date to which conservative scholars assign the earliest of 
them), consist of songs of praise and prayer directed to <i>Agni</i> 
(fire), <i>Soma</i> (the life-awakening, intoxicating juice of the 
soma-plant), <i>Indra</i> (the god of the wars of the elements, of 
thunder and rain), <i>Varuna</i> (the great, serene, all-embracing 
heaven), and other deities, all of whom possess more or less definitely 
the twofold character of gods of nature and gods of sacrifice. The gods 
of the Vedic hymns are styled <i>Devas</i> (shining divinities) and 
<i>Asuras</i> (lords). There is, in the poems, no evidence of a 
sustained attempt to trace the genealogy of these deities or to account 
by means of mythogical concepts for the origin of the universe. 
 <!--
16 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p16"></a><p>

In the <i>Br&acirc;hmanas</i>, or ritualistic commentaries, appears the 
concept of a god distinct from the elemental deities, a personification 
of the act of sacrifice, -- Brahmanaspati. From this concept the 
monotheistic and pantheistic speculation of the Hindus may be said to 
have started, although it is undeniable that even in the hymns there is 
expressed at least "a yearning after one supreme deity, who made the 
heaven and the earth, the sea and all that in them is," -- a yearning 
to which expression was given in the name Prag&acirc;pati (the lord of 
all creatures), applied successively to Soma and other divinities. Of 
more importance, however, than the name <i>Prag&acirc;pati</i> is the 
expression <i>Tad Ekam</i> (that One) which occurs in the poems as the 
name of the Supreme Being, of the First Origin of all things. Its 
neuter form indicates, according to Max M&uuml;ller, a transition from 
the mythological to the metaphysical stage of speculation. With regard 
to the word <i>Brahman</i> which succeeded <i>Tad Ekam</i>: as the name 
of the Supreme One, Max M&uuml;ller refers it to the root <i>brih</i> 
(to grow) and asserts that while the word undoubtedly meant prayer, it 
originally meant "that which breaks forth." It "was used as a name of 
that universal force which manifests itself in the creation of a 
visible universe."<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> The word <i>&Acirc;tman</i>, which was also a 
name of the deity, is referred by the same distinguished scholar to the 
root <i>&acirc;tma</i> (breath, life, soul) and is translated as 
<i>Self</i>. There grew up, he says, in the hymns and Br&acirc;hmanas 
of the Veda the three words Prag&acirc;pati, Brahman, and &Acirc;tman, 
"each of which by itself represents <i>in nuce</i> a whole philosophy, 
or a view of the world. A belief in Prag&acirc;pati, as a personal god, 
was the beginning of monotheistic religion in India, while the 
recognition of Brahman and &Acirc;tman, as one, constituted the 
foundation of all the monistic philosophy of that country."<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup><p>

In the <i>Upanishads</i>, or speculative commentaries, we find the 
first elaborate attempts made by India to formulate a speculative
 <!--
INDIA 17 
 --><A NAME="p17"></a>
 system of the universe and to solve in terms of philosophy the 
problems of the origin of the universe and of the nature and destiny of 
man. It must, however, be remembered that probably until the fourth 
century B.C. the Upanishads, in common with the other portions of the 
Veda, did not exist in writing, being handed down from one generation 
to another by oral tradition. The <i>S&ucirc;tras</i>, or aphorisms, 
therefore, which we possess of the six systems of Indian philosophy do 
not represent the first attempts at philosophical speculation. The men 
whose names are associated with these S&ucirc;tras, and are used to 
designate the six systems, are not, in any true sense, the founders of 
schools of philosophy: they are merely final editors or redactors of 
the S&ucirc;tras belonging to different philosophical sects, which, in 
the midst of a variety of theories, and in a maze of speculative 
opinions, retained their individuality during an inconceivably long 
period of time.<p>

Before we take up the separate study of the six systems of philosophy 
it will be necessary to outline the general teaching of the Upanishads. 
This teaching belongs to no school in particular, although each of the 
six schools is connected with it in more than one point of doctrine. 
The Upanishads teach:<p>

1. <i>The identity of all being in Brahman</i>, the Source, or 
<i>&Acirc;tman</i>, the Self, which is identical with Brahman.<p>

2. <i>The existence of m&acirc;y&acirc;</i> (illusion), to which is 
referred everything which is not Brahman.<p>

3. The worthlessness of all knowledge of things in their isolated 
existence, and the incomparable excellence of the <i>knowledge of all 
things in Brahman or &Acirc;tman</i>. This latter, the only true 
knowledge, is difficult of attainment; still it is attainable even in 
this life. It is this knowledge which constitutes the happiness of man 
by uniting him with &Acirc;tman. "In the bee's honey one can no longer 
recognize the taste of the single flowers; the rivers which emanate 
from the one sea and again return to it lose meanwhile their separate 
existences; 
 <!--
18 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p18"></a>
 a lump of salt dissolved in water salts the whole water and cannot be 
grasped again: so the true being can nowhere be grasped. It is a subtle 
essence which lies at the foundation of all phenomena, which are merely 
illusions, and is again identical with the <i>ego</i>."<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup><p>

4. <i>The immortality of the soul</i>. "The idea," writes Max 
M&uuml;ller, "of the soul ever coming to an end is so strange to the 
Indian mind that there seemed to be no necessity for anything like 
proofs of immortality, so common in European philosophy."<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> Equally 
self-evident to the Hindu mind was the <i>sams&acirc;ra</i>, or 
transmigration of the soul. In some systems, however, as we shall see, 
it is the subtle body which migrates, while, during the process of 
migration, the soul, in the sense of self, retaining its complete 
identity, remains as an onlooker.<p>

With the idea of immortality is associated that of the eternity of 
<i>karman</i> (deed), namely, the continuous working of every thought, 
word, and deed through all ages. If a man were, once in a thousand 
years, to pass his silken handkerchief across the Himalayan mountains 
and thus at last succeed in wiping them out, the world would, indeed, 
be older at the end of such a long space of time, but eternity and 
reality would still be young and the deed of to-day would still exist 
in its results. At a late period in the development of Vedic 
speculation the immensity of the duration of Brahman was given popular 
expression in the doctrine of <i>kalpas</i> (aeons), or periods of 
reabsorption (<i>pralaya</i>) and creation.<p>

5. <i>Mysticism and deliverance from bondage</i>. All the Indian 
systems of philosophy recognize the existence of evil and suffering and 
concern themselves with the problem of deliverance by means of 
knowledge. From the rise of Buddhism (fifth century B.C.) date a 
clearer perception of the reality of suffering and a more emphatic 
assertion of the
 <!--
 <!--
INDIA 19
 --><A NAME="p19"></a>
 importance of freeing the soul from the bondage which suffering 
imposes. It is to be remarked that, even in the Upanishads, existence 
is referred to as an evil, transmigration is presented as something to 
be avoided, and the final goal of human endeavor is proclaimed to be a 
union with &Acirc;tman, in which all individual existence is merged in 
the general Self, and individual consciousness is quite extinguished.<p>

Turning now to the six great historical systems of Indian philosophy, 
we meet at the very outset the vexed question of chronological order. 
Many of the S&ucirc;tras, or aphorisms, in which these systems are 
formulated are of very great antiquity, ranking with the Upanishads in 
point of age. Besides, the athors of these S&ucirc;tras are more or 
less vaguely historical or altogether mythical persons. It is hopeless, 
therefore, to attempt to arrange the systems in chronological order. 
The order followed will represent rather the fidelity with which 
the systems (all of which were considered orthodox) adhere to the 
doctrines described as the common teaching of the Upanishads.<p>

1. The Ved&acirc;nta, or Uttara-M&icirc;m&acirc;ms&acirc;,<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> is first 
in importance among the systematic expositions of the philosophical 
teachings of the Upanishads. It is contained in S&ucirc;tras composed 
by <b>B&acirc;dar&acirc;yana</b>, who is sometimes identified with 
<b>Vy&acirc;sa</b>, the author of the <i>Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</i> 
(one of the great epics of India), and in commentaries composed by 
<b>Samkara</b> (about A.D. 900).<p>

The fundamental doctrines of the Ved&acirc;nta are those of the 
Upanishads. The Ved&acirc;nta insists on the monistic concept of 
reality: "In one half verse I shall tell you what has been taught in 
thousands of volumes: Brahman is true, the world 
 <!--
20 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p20"></a>
 is false, the soul is Brahman and nothing else." "There is nothing 
worth gaining, there is nothing worth enjoying, there is nothing worth 
knowing but Brahman alone, for he who knows Brahman is Brahman."<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> 
More emphatically still is the unity of all being in Brahman asserted 
in the famous words <i>Tat tvam asi</i> (Thou art that), which Max 
M&uuml;ller styles "the boldest and truest synthesis in the whole 
history of philosophy." But, if the individual is Brahman, how are we 
to account for the manifold "thous" and for the variety of individuals 
in the objective world? The <i>Ved&acirc;nta-S&ucirc;tras</i> answer 
that the view of the world as composed of manifold individuals is not 
knowledge but <i>nescience</i>, which the Ved&acirc;nta philosophy aims 
at expelling from the mind. This nescience (avidy&acirc;) is inborn in 
human nature, and it is only when it is expelled that the mind 
perceives Brahman to be the only reality. Samkara, the commentator, 
admits, however, that the phenomenal world, the whole objective world 
as distinct from the subject (Brahman), while it is the result of 
nescience, is nevertheless real for all practical purposes. Moreover, 
it is clear that phenomena, since they are Brahman, are real: only the 
multiplicity and distinction of phenomena are unreal 
(<i>m&acirc;y&acirc;</i>).<p>

With regard to the origin of the universe: the universe, since it is 
Brahman, cannot be said to originate. And yet Brahman is commonly 
represented as the cause of the universe. The Hindus, however, regarded 
cause and effect as merely two aspects of the same reality: the 
threads, they observed, are the cause of the cloth, yet what is the 
cloth but the aggregate of threads?<sup><small><a name="n21"><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Since the finiteness and individual distinctions of things are due to 
nescience, it is clear that the road to true <i>freedom</i> 
(<i>moksha</i> ) from the conditions of finite existence is the way of 
knowledge. The knowledge of the identity of Atman with 
 <!--
INDIA 21 
 -->
 Brahman, of Self with God, is true freedom and implies exemption from 
birth and transmigration. For, when death comes, he who, although he 
has fulfilled all his religious duties, shall have failed to attain the 
highest knowledge, shall be condemned to another round of existence. 
The subtle body, in which his soul (<i>&acirc;tman</i>) is clothed, 
shall wander through mist and cloud and darkness to the moon and thence 
shall be sent back to earth. But he who shall have attained perfect 
knowledge of Brahman shall finally become identified with Brahman, 
sharing in all the powers of Brahman except those of creating and 
ruling the universe. Partial freedom from finite conditions is, even in 
this life, a reward of perfect knowledge. The Ved&acirc;ntists, 
however, did not neglect the inculcation of moral excellence; for 
knowledge, they taught, is not to be attained except by discipline.<p>

II. The <i>P&ucirc;rva-M&icirc;m&acirc;s&acirc;</i> is a system of 
practical philosophy and is contained in twelve books of S&ucirc;tras 
attributed to <b>Gaimini</b>. Here the central idea is that of 
<i>duty</i> (<i>Dharma</i>), which includes sacrificial observances and 
rests ultimately on the superhuman authority of the Veda.<p>

III. The <i>S&acirc;mkhya philosophy</i> may be described as a toning 
down of the extreme of the Vedanta. It is contained in the 
<i>S&acirc;mkhya-S&ucirc;tras</i> or <i>Kapila-S&ucirc;tras</i>. These, 
at least in their present form, date from the fourteenth century after 
Christ, although the sage, <b>Kapila</b>, to whom they are ascribed 
lived certainly before the second century B.C. Of greater antiquity 
than the S&ucirc;tras are the <i>S&acirc;mkhya-K&acirc;rik&acirc;s</i>, 
or memorial verses, in which the philosophy of Kapila was epitomized as 
early as the first century B.C. A still older and more concise 
compilation The S&acirc;mkhya philosophy is found in the
 <i>Tattva-Sam&acirc;sa</i>, which reduces all truth to twenty-five 
topics. This latter compendium is taken by Max M&uuml;ller as the basis 
of his exposition of the teachings of Kapila.<sup><small><a name="n22"><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></a></small></sup>
 <!--
22 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><p>

The Samkhya philosophy is essentially dualistic. It does not, like the 
Ved&acirc;nta, assume that the objective world, as distinct from 
Brahman, is mere illusion or ignorance; it accepts the objective world 
as real and calls it <i>prakriti</i>, or <i>nature</i> in the sense of 
matter-containing-the-possibilities-of-all-things. This principle is of 
itself lifeless and unconscious, and rises into life and consciousness 
only when contemplated by the soul (<i>purusha</i>). What we call 
creation is, therefore, the temporary union of nature with soul, -- a 
union which arises from a lack of discrimination. How then is the soul 
to be freed from the bondage of finite existence? This is for the 
S&acirc;mkhya, as it was for the Vedanta, the chief problem of 
practical philosophy. But, while the Vedanta found deliverance in the 
recognition of the identity of the soul with Brahman, the S&acirc;mkhya 
finds it in the recognition of the difference between the soul and 
nature. This recognition confers freedom; for nature, once it is 
recognized by the soul as distinct, disappears together with all 
limitation and suffering: "<i>Prakritri</i>, once recognized by 
<i>Purusha</i>, withdraws itself so as not to expose itself for a 
second time to the danger of this glance." The assertion of the 
individuality of the soul as opposed to nature implies the multiplicity 
of souls. And this is another point of contrast between the 
Ved&acirc;nta and the S&acirc;mkhya: the former asserted the oneness of 
&Acirc;tman; the latter affirms the plurality of <i>purushas</i>.<p>

IV. The <i>Yoga philosophy</i> is contained in the S&ucirc;tras 
ascribed to <i>Pata&ntilde;gali</i>, who is supposed to have lived 
during the second century B.C. In these S&ucirc;tras we find 
practically all the metaphysical principles of the S&acirc;mkhya and, 
in addition, certain doctrines in which the theistic element is 
insisted upon. Kapila had denied the possibility of proving the 
existence of &Icirc;svara, the personal creator and ruler: 
Pata&ntiled;gali insists on the possibility of such proof. Of course, 
&Icirc;svara is not conceived as creator in our sense of the word, but 
merely as the highest of the <i>purushas</i>, all of which may be said 
to create inasmuch  
 <!--
INDIA 23 
 --><A NAME="p23"></a>
 as they, by contemplating nature, cause nature to be productive. Among 
the means of deliverance practised by the Yogins were the observance of 
certain postures, meditation, and the repetition of the sacred syllable 
<i>Om</i>.<p>

V. The <i>Ny&acirc;ya</i> philosophy is contained in the
 <i>Ny&acirc;ya-S&ucirc;tras</i>. The founder of the system was 
<i>Gotama</i>, or Gautama. According to this system, the supreme 
resignation, or freedom, in which man's highest happiness consists, is 
to be attained by a knowledge of the sixteen great topics of 
Ny&acirc;ya philosophy. These topics (<i>pad&acirc;rthas</i>) are means 
of knowledge, objects of knowledge, doubt, purpose, instance, 
established truth, premises, reasoning, conclusion, argumentation, 
sophistry, wrangling, fallacies, quibbles, false analogies, and 
unfitness for arguing. Taking up now the first of these, namely, the 
means of knowledge, we find that there are, according to the 
Ny&acirc;ya philosophy, four kinds of right perception: sensuous, 
inferential, comparative, and authoritative. In order to arrive at 
inferential knowledge (<i>anum&acirc;na</i>), we must possess what is 
called <i>vy&acirc;pti</i>, or pervasion, that is to iay, a principle 
expressing invariable concomitance. So, for example, if we wish to 
infer that "this mountain is on fire," we must possess the principle 
that smoke is <i>pervaded</i> by, or invariably connected with, fire. 
Once in possession of this principle, we have merely to find an 
instance, as, "this mountain smokes," whence we immediately infer that 
"it has fire." But, while this is the comparatively simple means of 
acquiring inferential iowledge, we cannot impart this knowledge to 
others except by the more complicated process including: (1) 
<i>Assertion</i>, "The mountain has fire"; (2) <i>Reason</i>, "Because 
it smokes"; (3) <i>Instance</i>, "Look at the kitchen fire"; (4) 
<i>Application</i>, "So too the mountain has smoke"; and (5) 
<i>Conclusion</i>, "Therefore it has fire." The process, in both cases, 
bears a close resemblance to the syllogism of Aristotelian logic; and 
it is by reason of the prominence given to this means of knowledge that 
the Ny&acirc;ya philosophy came to be regarded as a system of logic. 
Yet the 
 <!--
24 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p24"></a>
 Ny&acirc; ya philosophy is far from being merely a systematic 
treatment of the laws of thought; for the syllogism is but one of the 
many means by which the soul or self (<i>&Acirc;tman</i>) is to attain 
true freedom, a state in which all false knowledge and all inferior 
knowledge shall disappear, and all individual desire and personal love 
and hatred shall be extinguished.<p>

VI. The <i>Vaisheshika</i> philosophy, founded by <b>Kan&acirc;da</b>, 
is contained in the <i>Vaisheshika-S&ucirc;tras</i>, which, according 
to Max M&uuml;ller, date from the sixth century of the Christian era, 
although the Vaisheshika philosophy was known in the first century B.C. 
The system is closely related to the Ny&acirc;ya philosophy, even its 
most characteristic doctrine, that of atomism, being found in 
undeveloped form in the philosophy of Gotama.<sup><small><a name="n23"><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></a></small></sup> Here, as in the 
Ny&acirc;ya, supreme happiness is to be attained by the knowledge of 
certain <i>pad&acirc;rthas</i>, or quasi-categories, namely: substance, 
quality, action (<i>karman</i>), genus or community, species or 
particularity, inhesion or inseparability, and (according to some) 
privation or negation. The substances are earth, water, light, air, 
ether, time, space, self (<i>&Acirc;tman</i>), and mind (<i>manas</i>). 
The qualities are color, taste, number, etc. These are called 
<i>gunas</i> , a word which occurs in the Upanishads and is a common 
term in all the six systems.<p>

The four substances, earth, air, water, and light, exist either in the 
aggregate material state or in the state of atoms (<i>anus</i>). The 
single atom is indivisible and indestructible; its existence is proved 
by the impossibility of division <i>ad infinitum</i>. Single atoms 
combine first in twos and afterwards in groups of three double atoms; 
it is only in such combinations that matter becomes visible and liable 
to destruction.<p>

To these six great historical systems, which were orthodox in so far as 
they recognized the supreme authority of the Veda, were opposed the 
heterodox systems of the heretics (<i>N&acirc;stikas</i>) who, like the 
Buddhists, the Jainas, and the Materialists, rejected the divine 
authority of the sacred writings. 
 <!--
INDIA 25  
 --><p>

<i>Buddhism</i>, as is well known, was a distinctively religious 
system: it recognized suffering as the supreme reality in life, and 
devoted little or no attention to questions of philosophic interest, 
except in their relation to problems of conduct. "To cease from all 
wrong-doing, to get virtue, to cleanse one's own heart," -- this, 
according to the celebrated verse, "is the religion of the Buddhas."<sup><small><a name="n24"><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></a></small></sup> 
The four truths on which Buddhism is built are: (1) that suffering is 
universal; (2) that the cause of suffering is desire; (3) that the 
abolition of desire is the only deliverance from suffering; and (4) 
that the way of salvation is by means of certain practices of 
meditation and active discipline. In connection with the second and 
third of these truths arises the problem of the meaning of <i>karma</i> 
and <i>nirv&acirc;na</i>. In the Upanishad speculations <i>karman</i>, 
as we have seen, meant deed, and its eternity meant the continuous 
working of every thought, word, and work throughout all ages. In 
Buddhistic speculation the substantial permanence and identity of the 
soul are denied, and the only bond between the <i>skandhas</i>, or sets 
of qualities, which succeed each other in the individual body and soul, 
is the <i>karma</i>, the result of what man is and does in one 
existence or at one time being inevitably continued into all subsequent 
existences and times. The body is constantly changing, the qualities or 
states of the soul are constantly replaced by other qualities and 
states; but the result of what a man is and does remains, -- that alone 
is permanent. With regard to <i>nirv&acirc;na</i>, scholars are not 
agreed as to whether it meant total annihilation or a state of 
painlessness in which positive existence is preserved. Max M&uuml;ller 
and Rhys-Davids may be cited favor of the latter interpretation.<sup><small><a name="n25"><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></a></small></sup> 
Rhys-Davids defines <i>nirv&acirc;na</i> as "the extinction of that 
sinful, grasping condition of 
 <!--
26 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 -->
 mind and heart, which would otherwise, according to the mystery of 
Karma, be the cause of renewed individual existence."<p>

<i>Jainism</i>, like Buddhism, was a religious system. The only 
important speculative doctrine in which it differs from Buddhism is 
that of the <i>substantial reality and permanence of the soul</i>. 
Accordingly, the Jainas taught that <i>nirv&acirc;na</i> is the freedom 
of the soul from the conditions which cause finiteness, suffering, and 
ignorance. In this respect they approach very closely to the 
speculation of the Upanishads.<p>

<hr align="center"><p><a name="Persia"></a>  
<h3 align="center">PERSIA<sup><small><a name="n26"><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

The religion of ancient Persia and that of ancient India sprang from 
the same origin, namely, the ideas and usages which were shared alike 
by the Iranian and the Hindu branches of the original Aryan family. 
There are, indeed, traces of a civilization which existed in Persia 
prior to the Aryan invasion, and which closely resembled the Shamanism 
of the Accadians of ancient Chaldea. Little, however, is known of
 pre-Aryan Persia. All that can be said with certainty is that the 
Aryan invaders found already existing in Bactria and the neighboring 
regions a system of polytheism, which they replaced by a religion 
monotheistic in its tendency and similar in many respects to the 
religion of the Hindus of the Vedic period. The heaven god, known in 
India as <i>Varuna</i>, became the principal deity of the Iranians. 
<i>Soma</i> was also worshiped under the title <i>Homa</i>, and the 
distinction between Devas and Asuras ("shining ones" and "lords") was 
employed in Persia as well as in India to designate two important 
classes of divinities. Gradually, however, a change was introduced: a 
tendency towards dualism became more and more strongly marked; the 
<i>Devas</i> came to be recognized  
 <!--
PERSIA 27 
 -->
 as evil deities, and the <i>Ahuras</i> (transliteration of Asuras) 
came to be looked upon as divinities friendly to man. "The conflict 
between these opposites assumed a moral form in the minds of the 
Iranian wanderers; the struggle between night and day, between the 
storm and the blue sky, of which the Vedic poets sang, was transformed 
into a struggle between good and evil. In place of the careless nature 
worshipers of the Panjab, a race of stern and earnest Puritans grew up 
among the deserts and rugged mountains of Ariana."<sup><small><a name="n27"><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></a></small></sup><p>

This dualistic conception of the universe, this antithesis between good 
and evil, was already in possession when <b>Zoroaster</b>, or 
<b>Zarathustra</b>, the great religious reformer, appeared, about the 
middle of the seventh or the beginning of the sixth century B.C.<sup><small><a name="n28"><a href="#n_28">{28}</a></a></small></sup> To 
him, according to Parsee tradition, is to be ascribed the inspired 
authorship of a portion, at least, of the <i>Avesta</i>, or sacred 
literature of the Persians. This collection consists of five 
<i>Gathas</i>, or hymns, written in an older dialect than that of the 
rest of the collection, the <i>Vendidad</i>, or compilation of 
religious laws and mythical tales, and the <i>Zend</i>, or commentary. 
The first two portions constitute the Avesta proper, that is to say, 
"law" or "knowledge." In addition to the Avesta-Zend, there existed the 
<i>Khorda Avesta</i>, or Small Avesta, which was a collection of 
prayers. Zoroaster's share in the composition of these books is a 
matter which it is impossible, in the present condition of our 
knowledge, to determine. It is, however, beyond dispute that the sacred 
literature of the Persians reflects the beliefs which existed before 
the time of Zoroaster as well as those which Zoroaster introduced.<p>

The religious reform effected by Zoroaster consisted in reducing to two 
more or less vague principles the good and evil  
 <!--
28 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 -->
 elements in the universe. For him, as for his ancestors, the world is 
a vast battlefield, in which the forces of good and evil meet in a 
mighty conflict. But, instead of representing the contending forces as 
independent principles, manifold, yet capable of being classified as 
good and evil, he reduces all the conflicting powers to two, the good 
and the evil, of which the individual forces are derivatives. The 
<i>good principle</i> is called <i>Ahura-mazda</i> (<i>Ormuzd</i>, or 
<i>Ormazd</i>), and the <i>evil principle</i> is called
 <i>Anra-mainyu</i> (<i>Ahrim&acirc;n</i>). The former is conceived as 
light and day, the latter as darkness and night. From the former 
proceed the <i>Ahuras</i>, or living lords (who were afterwards called 
<i>Yazatas</i>, or angels), and in general all that is good and 
beneficial to man: from the latter proceed the <i>Devas</i>, who 
opposed the Ahuras in the original conflict between day and night and 
who became the "demons" of latter Mazdeism, and, in general, from 
Ahrim&acirc;n comes all that is evil and injurious to man.<p>

It is man's duty to worship Ormazd (fire, being the sacred symbol, is 
also to be honored) by prayer, sacrifice, and the oblation of Homa (the 
juice of the sacred plant). It is also his duty to cultivate the soil 
and in other ways to promote the life and growth of the creatures of 
Ormazd, to destroy the works of Ahrim&acirc;n, to kill all venomous and 
noxious things, and to rid the earth of all creatures injurious to man.<p>

At the end of twelve thousand years the present cosmic period will come 
to an end. Ormazd will finally triumph, for, although Ahrim&acirc;n is not 
inferior in power to Ormazd, he fights blindly and without adequate 
knowledge of the results of his actions; therefore, he and his works 
will come to an end, and, after the final struggle, storm and night 
will cease, calm and sunshine will reign, and all will be absorbed in 
Ormazd. In this universal absorption in Ormazd the human soul will be 
included.<p>

Mazdeism (the religion of Ormazd) in its later development attached 
great importance to the worship of Mithra, the sun god. 
 <!--
PERSIA 29 
 --><A NAME="p29"></a>
 In this form it appeared in Rome and was among the first of the 
Oriental religions to gain ascendency over the minds of the Romans. 
Zoroastrianism was introduced as a heresy into the Christian Church by 
Manes, the founder of the Manichean sect.<p>

<b>Retrospect</b>. In the systems of thought which flourished among the 
great historical nations of the East, there is, as has been observed, 
an almost complete lack of the rational element. In some of them, 
however, and especially in the Indian systems, there is abundance of 
speculation. Living in a country where there was practically no 
struggle for life, where the means of subsistence were produced without 
much effort on the part of the tillers of the soil, and where for 
thousands of years war was unknown save the war of extermination waged 
against the original dwellers in the land, the Hindus gave themselves 
up unreservedly to the solution of the problems, Whence are we come? 
Whereby do we live? and Whither do we go?<p>

In solving these problems, however, the Hindus, while they succeeded 
better than other Oriental peoples in separating the speculative from 
the mythological, failed to develop the rational or dialectical phase 
of thought. Their speculative systems are positive rather than 
argumentative. It was in Greece that philosophy as a dialectical, 
argumentative science found its first home.<p>

There can be no doubt that the systems which have just been sketched 
exercised some, if only an indefinite, influence on the speculative 
efforts of the first philosophers of Greece. The geographical 
contiguity and the commercial intercourse of the Hellenic colonies with 
the countries of the interior of Asia render such a supposition 
probable. It was not, however, until Greek philosophy had run its 
practically independent course of national development, that the 
religious systems of the Orient were finally united with the great 
current of Greek thought, East and the West pouring their distinctive 
contributions into the common stream of Greco-Oriental theosophy.<p>

<a name="n_8"><a href="#n8">{8}</a></a> Mention is also made of Osiris, or that part of man's immortal 
nature which has such close resemblance to the god Osiris as to be 
called by his hame. Wiedemann (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 244) maintains that 
in the different designations, <i>Ka</i>, etc., we have to do with 
different conceptions of an immortal soul, which had arisen in separate 
places in prehistoric times and were ultimately combined into one 
doctrine, "the Egyptians not daring to set any aside for fear it should 
prove to be the true one."<p>

called because it is regarded by the Hindus as later than the
