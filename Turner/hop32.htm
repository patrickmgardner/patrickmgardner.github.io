ABELARD</h3><p>

<b>Life</b>. The most conspicuous figure in the great dialectical contest 
which occupied so large a share of the attention of philosophers during 
the twelfth century is Peter Abelard, who was born at Pallet, near 
Nantes, in Brittany, in the year 1079. After having studied under 
Roscelin he went to Paris, where he attended the lectures of William of 
Champeaux. Being, as St. Bernard says, "vir bellator ab adolescentia," 
he quarreled with his master, and, at the age of twenty-two, set up a 
rival school, teaching first at Melun and afterwards at Corbeil. When 
William retired to the monastery of St. Victor (1108) Abelard returned 
to Paris, where he enjoyed the 
 <!--
286 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p286"></a>
 most extraordinary success as a lecturer on dialectic. He first taught 
at Ste. Genevieve and later (about 113) at the cathedral school of 
Notre Dame. In his autobiography, which he so appropriately styles 
<i>Historia Calamitatum</i>, he tells of his love for Heloise, of the 
vengeance of the canon Fulbert, of the secret marriage, of his entry 
into the Benedictine order at the abbey of St. Denis, of the retirement 
of Heloise to the convent of Argenteuil, and of the foundation of the 
oratory called the Paraclete. He makes no secret of the pride and 
vanity to which he attributed his downfall and the sufferings of his 
later life.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup><p>

About the time he had attained the greatest eminence as a teacher of 
dialectic, Abelard presented himself at the school of the venerable 
Anselm of Laon for the purpose of studying theology. At Laon it was the 
same story of insubordination as at Paris: Abelard was uneasy until he 
had discomfited the <i>Doctor Doctorum</i> (Anselm) as completely as he 
had overthrown the <i>Columna Doctorum</i> (William of Champeaux). 
After the downfall of Abelard the disciples of Anselm had their day of 
revenge. Summoned before the council of Soissons (1121) Abelard was 
obliged to recite the Athanasian creed and to burn his book on the 
Trinity.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> After this he retired to a desert region near Troyes. 
Thence he went to the monastery of St Gildas de Rhuys in Brittany. The 
monks, however, drove him from the abbey, and after some years spent in 
the neighborhood of Nantes he resumed his lectures at Paris. Pupils now 
began to flock in such numbers to his school that Anselm's disciples 
became alarmed once more, and the intervention of St. Bernard of 
Clairvaux was invoked. Abelard treated Bernard and his monks with 
characteristic disdain. St. Bernard wrote to Rome, and sent a circular 
letter to the bishops of France. The result was, that at Abelard's own 
request (so at least it seems) a council was assembled at Sens 
(1140).<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> Abelard, however, refused to defend himself; nevertheless he 
was condemned, but, because he appealed to Rome, he was allowed to 
accept the hospitality of the venerable Peter of Cluny,<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> at whose 
monastery he spent the last two years of 
 <!--
ABELARD 287 
 --><A NAME="p287"></a>
 his life in peace. He died, in 1142, at Ch&acirc;lons-sur-Sa&ocirc;ne, 
four leagues distant from Cluny, and was buried at the Paraclete.<p>

<b>Character</b>. Abelard is a type of the fighting dialectician of the 
twelfth century, -- <i>vir bellator</i>. He was by disposition a 
rationalist, intolerant of restraint, totally devoid of respect for 
authority, and so fond of displaying his extraordinary talents that he 
appears to have preferred victory to truth.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. In addition to the <i>Historia Calamitatum</i>, we 
possess the following works of Abelard (<i>cf.</i> Migne, <i>Patr. Lat.</i>, 
Vol. CLXXVIII): <i>Epistolae, Expositio Fidei, Introductio ad 
Theologiam, Theologia Christiana, Ethica</i> (or <i>Scite Teipsum</i>), 
<i>Sic et Non, Dialogus inter Philosophum Judaeum et Christianum</i>. 
To these are to be added the <i>Summa Dialecticae</i> and perhaps also 
the fragment <i>De Generibus et Speciebus</i> published by Cousin. 
Monographs: R&eacute;musat, <i>Ab&eacute;lard</i> (Paris, 1845); 
Deutsch, <i>Peter Ab&auml;lard</i> (Leipzig, 1883).<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>Method</b>. Abelard is primarily a dialectician. Dialectic he 
defines as the art of discerning the true from the false: it implies 
the task of discerning or distinguishing thoughts and the subsidiary 
task of distinguishing words. In the <i>Sic et Non</i> Abelard 
formulates the principal theses of theology and presents the opinions 
of the Fathers pro and contra. This idea of philosophic method was 
further developed by Alexander of Hales, and became the recognized 
method of the schoolmen of the thirteenth century and of their 
successors.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Doctrine of Universals</b>. There is nothing more certain than that 
Abelard was equally opposed to the nominalism of Roscelin and to the 
realism of William of Champeaux. It is not, however, so easy to 
determine what was Abelard's own answer to   
 <!--
288 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p288"></a>
 the questions proposed by Porphyry. John of Salisbury, a disciple of 
Abelard, after mentioning the opinion of Roscelin, speaks of Abelard's 
doctrine in the following terms:<p>

<blockquote>
Alius <i>sermones</i> intuetur et ad illos detorquet quidquid alicubi 
de universalibus meminit scriptum. In hac autem opinione deprehensus 
est peripateticus palatinus Abaelardus noster.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

Distinguishing between <i>vox</i> and <i>sermo</i> (the word as used in 
a sentence), Abelard would maintain "est sermo predicabilis." 
Apparently, therefore, Abelard was a modified nominalist: he is 
generally classed with the conceptualists, and John of Salisbury's 
statement that Abelard and his followers "rem de re praedicari monstrum 
ducunt "<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> seems definitely to exclude them from the ranks of the 
realists.<p>

From the texts furnished by R&eacute;musat and Cousin, it is clear that 
the traditiohal opinion which regarded Abelard as the founder of 
conceptualism must he abandoned. Abelard nowhere teaches that the 
universal existing in the mind has no objective value. On the contrary, 
while he does not succeed in discovering a neat and concise formula in 
which to express his doctrine of realism, he maintains principles which 
justify us in classing him not only among the anti-realists, who 
opposed exaggerated realism (the antiqua doctrina), but even among the 
moderate realists, although his moderate realism is naturally 
undeveloped. Among the principles to which we refer are the following:<p>

1. The universal has no existence apart from the individual: "Cum nec 
ipsae species habeant nisi per individua subsistere."<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

2. The universal is not a mere word: the word becomes universal by 
means of the mode of predication which it assumes on being made part of 
a sentence. It is therefore, presumably, the mind which confers 
universality, on account of the essential similarity of different 
individuals. This thought is not, however, 
 <!--
ABELARD 289 
 --><A NAME="p289"></a>
 explicitly enunciated by Abelard: it is merely contained in his 
distinction of <i>vox</i> and <i>sermo</i>.<p>

3. The <i>difference</i> of genera and species is founded on a 
difference of things: "Diversitas substantim diversitatem generum et 
specierum facit."<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Relation of Philosophy to Theology</b>. In the <i>Introductio ad 
Theologiam</i> Abelard lays down certain principles which seem to remove 
all distinction between philosophy and theology by reducing the latter 
to the level of the former. Faith must be based on reason:<p>

<blockquote>
Si enim, cum persuadetur aliud ut credatur, nil est ratione 
discutiendum, utrum scilicet credi oporteat vel non, quid restat nisi 
ut aeque tam falsa quam vera praedicantibus acquiescamus.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup>
</blockquote><p>

Again, he says: "Nec quia Deus id dixerat creditur, sed quia hoc sic 
esse convincitur accipitur,"<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> a -- a principle which, it is said, 
offended St. Bernard's sense of orthodoxy and constituted the real 
reason of Abelard's second condemnation.<p>

The <i>Credo ut intelligam</i> and the <i>Intelligo ut credam</i> are 
equally essential to the Scholastic doctrine of the relation between 
philosophy and theology. By neglecting the former altogether, and by 
insisting on the latter exclusively, Abelard unduly emphasizes the 
rationalistic element in Scholasticism. Like Erigena, he identifies 
philosophy with theology. But, while Erigena understood the identity in 
one sense, Abelard understands it in another: Erigena's point of view 
was that of a mystic; Abelard's point of view is that of a rationalist. 
Erigena raised philosophy to identification with theology, because God, 
the object of theology, is the only reality, and is therefore the 
object of philosophy. Abelard lowers theology to identification with 
philosophy, because the principle that in order to believe we must 
first understand is by him extended to mean that reason can comprehend 
even the mysteries of faith. It was in this 
 <!--
290 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p290"></a>
 spirit of rationalism that Abelard, according to Otto of Freising, 
compared the Holy Trinity to a syllogism. In a similar spirit. he 
affirmed the moral precepts of the Gospel to be merely a reformation of 
the natural law observed by pagan philosophers, and said and wrote many 
things which, though they were not heretical, gave offense by reason of 
their total disregard for authority.<p>

We are not here concerned with the theological doctrines for which 
Abelard was twice condemned. It is sufficient to note that the sum of 
the accusations brought forward by St. Bernard was that Abelard 
regarded the Trinity as a mere trinity of names, or, at most, of 
attributes.<p>

<b>Origin of the Universe</b>. Abelard's account of the origin of 
things is characterized by <i>necessitarianism</i> and <i>optimism</i>. 
Whatever God made, He made necessarily; for, whatever He made is good, 
and to say that He could abstain from doing what is good is to accuse 
Him of jealousy or of downright malice.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> God therefore made everything 
that He could make: "Ergo ubi non est velle Dei deest posse,"<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup> and the 
world is the best possible world, for the evil which exists is such as 
God could not prevent. In a certain sense, however, God created freely, 
because in the act of creation He was constrained by no external agent 
but only by His own nature.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Psychological Doctrines</b>. The soul, although in itself simple and 
spiritual, yet, inasmuch as it is included in the body, is corporeal. 
For this reason Abelard<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> says that all creatures are corporeal; the 
angels, because they are circumscribed by place, and the human soul 
because it is included in the body. The soul is the principle of life: 
it makes the body to be what it is.<p>

Abelard speaks of free judgment (<i>liberum arbitrium</i>) rather than 
of free will. Judgment is free because there is no 
 <!--
ABELARD 291 
 --><A NAME="p291"></a>
 compulsion, and freedom consists in the power to act or abstain from 
acting.<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Ethical Doctrines</b>. In his ethical treatise<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup> Abelard 
distinguishes between <i>vitium, peccatum</i>, and <i>mala actio</i>. 
<i>Vitium</i> is the inclination to sin, -- "id quo ad peccandum proni 
efficimur, hoc est ad consentiendum ei quod non convenit." 
<i>Peccatum</i> is not mere <i>mala voluntas</i>: it is "contemptus 
Dei, sive consensus in eo quod credimus propter Deum dimittendum." 
<i>Mala actio</i> is the external act, the <i>opus peccati</i>, which 
is not, properly speaking (that is, formally), a sin at all, but merely 
the matter of sin,<p>

From this distinction it follows that all external actions are, in 
themselves, morally indifferent: it is the intention that causes them 
to be good or evil: "Opera omnia in se indifferentia, nec nisi pro 
intentione agentis bona vel mala dicenda sunt."<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup> God looks not to the 
deed, but to the intention, and He punishes the intention rather than 
the act, -- "non enim Deus ex damno, sed ex contemptu offendi 
potest." Finally, where ignorance blinds or force coerces there is no 
sin, sin being essentially something contrary to conscience: "Non est 
peccatum nisi contra conscientiam."<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> Conscience must, therefore, be 
our guide, since it corresponds to the external norms of conduct.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. Abelard was acknowledged to be the foremost 
dialectician of an age in which dialectic was cultivated as it never 
has been cultivated since. "Huic soli," says an epitaph, written by a 
contemporary, "patuit scibile quidquid erat." He appeared in the 
twelfth century like a brilliant comet which dazzled for a moment but 
failed to shed permanent light. His was a highly gifted mind, but it 
was a mind whose prominent quality was brilliancy rather than 
profundity. He discussed many questions but exhausted none. His career, 
however, brought out the many-sidedness of the Scholastic movement, by 
exhibiting in exaggerated form the rationalistic element of 
 <!--
292 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p292"></a>
 Scholasticism. Abelard was condemned, not because he advocated the 
rights of reason, nor because he applied dialectic to the discussion of 
the Trinity, -- St. Augustine had done this without incurring reproach,  
-- but because of the extravagant claims which he urged on behalf of 
reason, and because of the heresy into which he fell in his discussion 
of the Trinitarian mystery.<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<a name="n_2"><a href="#n2">{2}</a></a> The work condemned and burned on this occasion was the <i>Tractatus 
de Unitate et Trinitate Divina</i>. This treatise was discovered and 
edited in 1891 by Dr. Stolze of Wurzburg. The <i>Theologia 
Christiana</i>, as we now possess it, is a revised form of the original 
<i>Tractatus</i>, with some significant omissions and some 
amplifications by way of explanation and apology. <i>cf.</i> Poole, 
<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 150.<p> 

<a name="n_3"><a href="#n3">{3}</a></a> Deutsch, <i>Die Synode von Sens, 1141</i> (Berlin, 1880), maintains 
that the Synod was held in 1141. <i>cf.</i> Denifle, <i>Archiv</i>, I, 
603, 606.<p> 

<a name="n_4"><a href="#n4">{4}</a></a> Peter, writing under the impressions of these two years' 
intercourse with Abelard, describes him as "ever to be named with 
honor, the servant of Christ and verily Christ's philosopher" 
(<i>Epistola ad Heloissam, Patr. Lat.</i>, Vol. CLXX VIII, co]. 66). 
That St. Bernard was unfair to Abelard both before and after the 
council is the opinion now entertained by many Catholic writers.

among Abelard's works was written, according to Ritter, by <b>Joscelin 
(Gauslenus)</b> of Soissons (bishop of Soissons from 1122 to 1151), of 
whom John of Salisbury makes mention in his <i>Metalogicus</i> (II, 
17). Ritter's conjecture is not, however, accepted by St&ouml;ckl and 
others, who are content with assigning the treatise in question to some 
writer belonging to the first half of the twelfth century. The author 
of the treatise is equally opposed to nominalism and to that form of 
realism which maintains the physical unity of that which corresponds to 
the universal.<p>
