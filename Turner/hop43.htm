398 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p398"></a>
<h2 align="center">FOURTH PERIOD OF SCHOLASTICISM</h2>
<h3 align="center">Birth of Ockam to taking of Constantinople (1300-1453)<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup></h3><p>

The causes of the decay of Scholastic philosophy were both internal and 
external. The internal causes are to be found in the condition of 
Scholastic philosophy at the beginning of the fourteenth century. The 
great work of Christian syncretism had been completed by the masters of 
the preceding period: revelation and science had been harmonized; 
contribution had been levied on the pagan philosophies of Greece and 
Arabia, and whatever truth these philosophies had possessed had been 
utilized to form the basis of a rational exposition of Christian 
revelation. The efforts of Roger Bacon and of Albert the Great to 
reform scientific method had failed: the sciences were not cultivated. 
There was therefore no source of development, and nothing was left for 
the later Scholastics except to dispute as to the meaning of 
principles, to comment on the text of this master or of that, and to 
subtilize to such an extent that Scholasticism soon became a synonym 
for captious quibbling. The great Thomistic principle that in 
philosophy the argument from authority is the weakest of all arguments 
was forgotten: Aristotle, St. Thomas, or Scotus became the criterion of 
truth, and as Solomon, whose youthful wisdom had astonished the world, 
profaned his old age by the worship of idols, the philosophy of the 
schools, in the days of its decadence, turned from the service of truth 
to prostrate itself before the shrine of a master.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> Dialectic, which 
in the thirteenth century had been regarded as the instrument of 
knowledge, now became an object of study for the sake of display; and 
to this fault of method was added a fault of style -- an uncouthness 
and barbarity of terminology which bewilder 
 <!--
CAUSES OF THE DECAY OF SCHOLASTICISM 399 
 --><A NAME="p399"></a>
 the modern reader. The religious orders, which had given to 
Scholasticism its ablest masters, now devoted all their attention to 
fomenting the Thomistic and Scotistic controversy, thus frittering away 
on matters of trifling importance the gifts which should have been 
devoted to the more serious task of meeting the difficulties that 
sprang up on every side as the modern era approached.<p>

The external causes of the decay of Scholasticism were, in the first 
place, the political conditions of the time. The fourteenth century was 
a period of strife between the secular and the spiritual power, of 
rebellion of princes, bishops, and priests against the authority of the 
Holy See, and of contests between rival claimants for the chair of 
Peter. Religion seemed to lose its restraining power, and moral 
depravity, sorcery, and occult science corrupted that true sense of the 
superiority of things spiritual which characterized the thirteenth 
century. The universities, too, which had contributed so much to the 
success of Scholasticism and had received so much from it in return, 
now began to bring discredit on the Scholastic system. At Paris, the 
course of study for the degrees in theology was shortened, and academic 
honors were distributed with more freedom than discretion, mere youths 
(<i>impuberes et imberbes</i>) being, through favor, awarded the title 
of master. Add to this that everywhere throughout Europe 
institutions<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> inferior to the great universities were accorded the 
right to confer degrees which had hitherto been the monopoly of Paris 
and Oxford.<p>

In the general relaxation of the spirit of serious study, there 
appeared a phase of Scholastic philosophy which may be said to have 
been inspired by the principle commonly known as "Ockam's razor": 
"Entia non sunt multiplicanda sine necessitate." In a spirit of protest 
against the extreme formalism of the Scotists, who multiplied 
metaphysical entities to an alarming degree, the new philosophy aimed 
at simplicity. Soon, however, 
 <!--
400 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p400"></a>
 it carried the process of simplification to the extent of discarding 
as useless all serious metaphysical and psychological speculation; it 
substituted dialectic for metaphysics, advocated nominalism, and ended 
in something dangerously near to sensism and scepticism.<p>

The chief representative of this phase of Scholasticism is <b>William of 
Ockam</b>. Before his time, however, the tendencies which resulted in his 
philosophy appeared in the doctrines of <b>Durandus</b> and 
<b>Aureolus</b>.<p>

<hr align="center"><p><a name="Chapter"></a>

<h3 align="center">CHAPTER XLIII<br>
PREDECESSORS OF OCKAM</h3><p>

DURANDUS<p>

<b>Life</b>. Durandus of St. Pour&ccedil;ain, <i>Doctor 
Resolutissimus</i> , was born at St. Pour&ccedil;ain, in Auvergne, 
towards the end of the thirteenth century. He joined the order of St. 
Dominic, and was at first a most ardent defender of the doctrines of 
St. Thomas. About the year 1313 he taught theology at Paris. After 
spending some years in Rome as Master of the Sacred Palace during the 
reign of John XXII, he returned to France and occupied successively the 
sees of Limoges, Puy, and Meaux. He tells us himself that he was bishop 
of Puy.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> The year 1332 is the most probable date of Durandus' death.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The most important of Durandus' works is entitled 
<i>Super Sententias Theologicas Petri Lombardi Commentariorum Libri 
Quatuor</i>. It was published in Paris in 1550. Trittenheim mentions 
several minor treatises. (<i>cf.</i> <i>Praefatio</i> to above edition.)<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

By his independence of thought and his advocacy of certain principles 
which his contemporaries considered dangerous, Durandus earned the 
title of <i>Doctor Resolutissimus</i>. Still, he  
 <!--
DURANDUS 401 
 --><A NAME="p401"></a>
 never exceeded the limits of orthodoxy. Indeed, the independence which 
he advocated, and which he formulated in the principle "Naturalis 
philosophia non est scire quid Aristoteles aut alii philosophi 
senserint, sed quid habeat veritas rerum," had been professed before 
his time and formulated almost in the same words by St. Thomas and the 
other great schoolmen. Such independence of thought was recognized as 
the birthright of every philosopher, and the fact that Durandus 
exercised this right without incurring ecclesiastical censure is the 
best refutation of the calumny that the Church refused to tolerate 
independent thinking as long as she could enforce obedience to her 
commands. Durandus manifested his independence:<p>

1. <b>In rejecting the Sensible and Intelligible Species</b>. The 
reason which he adduces is <i>a priori</i> rather than empirical, and 
is based on a misconception of the Scholastic doctrine of species. In 
his <i>Commentary on the Books of Sentences</i>,<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> he first gives his 
opinion that the doctrine of species was introduced to explain 
sense-perception, and was transferred to the explanation of intellectual 
knowledge; he then proceeds to criticise the doctrine of <i>sensible 
species as follows</i>:<p>

<blockquote>
Omne illud, per quad, tamquam per repraesentativum, potentia cognitiva 
fertur in alterum, est primo cognitum; sed species coloris in oculo non 
est primo cognita seu visa ab eo, immo nullo modo est visa ab eo ergo 
per ipsam, tamquam per repraesentativum, non fertur in aliquid aliud.  
</blockquote><p>

Now this argument is simply irrelevant. The predecessors of Durandus, 
so far from teaching that the species is a <i>medium 
repraesentativum</i>, maintained, on the contrary, that it is merely a 
medium by which the object becomes present to the subject -- what may 
be called a <i>medium praesentativum</i>, that is to say, a <i>medium 
communicationis</i>. It is owing to a similar misunderstanding that 
later nominalists and so many modern writers regard the scholastic 
doctrine of species as untenable.  
 <!--
402 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY
 --><A NAME="p402"></a><p>

2. <b>In rejecting the Active Intellect</b>. This follows as a natural 
consequence from the rejection of the species. Durandus teaches that 
there is no more need of an active intellect than of an active 
sense.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> Here, again, he misunderstands the Scholastic doctrine. There 
is need of an active intellect, because, although the object of 
intellectual knowledge -- the universal nature -- exists in the world 
of sense-phenomena, it exists there clothed in material conditions, of 
which it must be divested before becoming actually intelligible, and 
the task of separating the universal from these material conditions is 
the work of the active intellect.<p>

3. <b>In his Advocacy of Nominalism</b>. This follows from the 
rejection of the active intellect. Durandus teaches that the object of 
the intellect is the individual as it exists, and that the universal 
exists nowhere outside the mind.<p>

<blockquote>
Universale non est primum objectum intellectus, nec praeexistit 
intellectioni, sed est aliquid formatum per operationem intelligendi . 
. . esse universale, esse genus vel speciem dicuntur entia rationis.<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

Durandus, however, does not openly profess nominalism, that is, he does 
not teach expressly, as the followers of Ockam do, that the only 
universality is the universality of names.<p>

4. <b>In his Doctrine of the Principle of Individuation</b>. Durandus 
teaches that the principle of individuation is not distinct from the 
specific nature of the individual, since everything is individuated by 
actual existence. "Non oportet praeter naturam et principia naturae
quaerere principia individui."<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup><p>

5. <b>In his Rejection of Divine Cooperation with Secondary Causes</b>. 
This is the doctrine by which Durandus places himself in most 
pronounced opposition to the current teaching of his time. The 
Scholastics of the thirteenth century unanimously taught that God is 
not only creator and preserver of all finite things, but also 
cooperator in all the actions of secondary causes. Durandus  
 <!--
AUREOLUS 403
 --><A NAME="p403"></a>
 maintains that all the actions of the creature proceed from God 
inasmuch as it is God Who gave creatures the power to act, but he 
denies that there is an immediate influxus of the Creator in the 
actions of the creature.<p>

<blockquote>
Non oportet quod Deus immediate coagat, sed solum mediate, conservando 
-- naturam et virtutem causae secundae.<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> Deus non est causa actionum 
liberi arbitrii, nisi quia liberum arbitrium ab Ipso est et 
conservatur.<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

The theological doctrines of Durandus are still more at variance with 
current teaching, and on some points his dogmatic opinions cannot 
without difficulty be reconciled with Catholic belief.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. If Duns Scotus is the Kant, Durandus is the 
Locke of Scholastic philosophy. His treatment of the most serious 
problems of psychology and metaphysics is marked by superficiality. He 
seemingly took no pains to make himself acquainted with the doctrines 
which he criticised, and his own solution of many a problem stops short 
of the point where the real problem begins. Simplicity, even at the 
expense of thoroughness, appears to have been his motto.<p>

AUREOLUS<p>

<b>Life</b>. Peter d'Auriol (<i>Aureolus</i>), <i>Doctor Facundus</i>, 
was born about the end of the thirteenth century at Toulouse.<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> In 
1318 he became master of theology at the University of Paris. In the 
following year he was made provincial of the Franciscans in Aquitaine. 
In 1321 he was promoted to the metropolitan see of Aix.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> He died in 
1322.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. The works of Aureolus, <i>Quodlibeta</i> and 
<i>Commentaria in Libros Sententiarum</i>, were published at Rome 
(1596-1605) in four folio volumes.<p>

DOCTRINES<p>

Aureolus was at first a Scotist. Later, however, actuated apparently by 
the idea which inspired Durandus to simplify Scholasticism, he arrived 
at conclusions which are practically 
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 404 
 --><A NAME="p404"></a>
 identical with those of the Doctor Most Resolute. He denied the 
reality of universals, the existence of species and of the active 
intellect, the distinction between essence and existence, and the 
distinction between the soul and its faculties. Referring to the 
doctrine of species, he says:<p>

<blockquote>
Unde patet quomodo res ipsae conspiciuntur in mente, et illud quod 
intuemur non est forma alia specularis sed ipsamet res habens esse 
apparens, et hoc est mentis conceptus, sive notitia objectiva.<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup>  
</blockquote><p>

The expression <i>forma specularis</i>, and the word <i>idolum</i> 
which occurs in the same article, both being used to designate the 
species, show that Aureolus was as far as Durandus was from 
understanding the r&ocirc;le which the great schoolmen assigned to the 
species.<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The doctrines of Aureolus as well as those 
of Durandus prepared the way for the outspoken conceptualism of Ockam<p>
