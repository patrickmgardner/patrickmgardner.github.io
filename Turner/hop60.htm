THE IDEALISTIC MOVEMENT</h3><p>

If post-Cartesian philosophy is to be described as busying itself with 
the problem of the antithesis of mind and matter, the pantheistic 
monism of Spinoza may be designated as an attempt to solve the problem 
by merging matter and mind in the unity of the infinite substance, and 
the empirical movement as an attempt to eliminate the antagonism by 
reducing mind to matter. The idealistic movement, which was represented 
by Leibniz and Berkeley, was still another essay to remove the 
antithesis between mind and matter, by reducing matter to mind. 
Perhaps, however, the true significance of the idealistic movement will 
be best understood if it is regarded rather as 
 <!--
506 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p506"></a>
 an attempt to restore the aesthetic and religious ideals which were 
threatened by the first empiricists and destroyed by the atheistic and 
materialistic empiricists of later times. But, whether we represent the 
idealistic movement as a solution of the Cartesian problem, or as a 
reaction against the purely scientific concept of philosophy, it will 
be evident, in either case, that Leibniz represents a more hesitating 
and less thorough, while Berkeley represents a more pronounced and more 
complete, form of idealism.<p>

LEIBNIZ<p>

<b>Life</b>. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born at Leipzig in 1646. At 
the age of fifteen he entered the university of his native city, 
devoting himself to the study of law and philosophy. After obtaining 
the degree of master of philosophy at Leipzig, and that of doctor of 
laws at Altdorf, he went to the court of the elector of Mainz, by whom 
he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Louis XIV of France. In France, 
England, and Holland he formed the acquaintance of the most learned men 
of the time, and, with the ample means at his disposal, he had no 
difficulty in acquiring a wonderfully wide and accurate knowledge of 
all the scientific and philosophical literature of the day. From 1676 
until his death, in 1716, Leibniz resided at Hannover, where he held 
the offices of court counselor and librarian.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Leibniz did not compose a complete and extended 
exposition of his philosophy. His writings are, for the most part, 
brief treatises and essays on various scientific and philosophical 
problems. The most important of these are <i>Disputatio Metathysica de 
Principio Individui, La monadologie, Essais de 
th&eacute;odic&eacute;e</i>, and <i>Nouveaux essais sur l'entendement 
humain</i> (reply to Locke's <i>Essay</i>). The principal editions of 
his collected works are those of Raspe (Leipzig and Amsterdam, 1765), 
Dutens (Geneva, 1768), Erdmann (Berlin, 1840), Foucher de Careil 
(Paris, 1859 ff.), and Paul Janet (Paris, 1866). Merx's <i>Leibniz</i> 
(<i>Blackwood's Philosophical Classics</i>, Edinburgh and Philadelphia, 
1884) and Dewey's <i>Leibniz's New Essays</i> (Chicago, 1888) will be 
found useful in the study of Leibniz' philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n1"><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></a></small></sup>  
 <!--
LEIBNIZ' DOCTRINE OF MONADS 507 
 --><A NAME="p507"></a><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>General Standpoint</b>. Descartes had started his philosophical 
speculations with the desire to isolate himself from his fellow-men, 
and to build up a philosophy which should owe nothing to his 
predecessors. Leibniz, on the contrary, was inspired with the thought 
of founding a system which should <i>reconcile all the systems of his 
predecessors</i>, bring Plato into harmony with Democritus, demonstrate 
the agreement of Aristotle with Descartes, and prove that there is no 
inherent contradiction between Scholasticism and modern thought.<sup><small><a name="n2"><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></a></small></sup> 
This was in keeping with the many-sided and cosmopolitan character of 
the man who, as discoverer of the differential calculus, ranked among 
the foremost mathematicians of his day, and was equally eminent as a 
scientist, a philosopher, and a religious controversialist.<p>

With a view to effecting this universal harmony of systems, Leibniz 
adopted a theory of reality which centers on the <i>doctrine of 
monads</i>, the <i>principle of pre&euml;stablished harmony</i>, and 
the <i>law of continuity</i>. He sought to establish the perfect 
correspondence of mind with matter and the participation of matter by 
mind and of mind by matter (pan-psychism).<p>

<b>Doctrine of Monads</b>. Leibniz, like Spinoza, considers that the 
notion of substance is the starting point in metaphysical speculation. 
But, while Spinoza defines substance as independent existence, Leibniz 
defines it as independent power of action: "La substance ne saurait 
etre sans action."<sup><small><a name="n3"><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></a></small></sup> From this difference there arises another: if 
substance be defined as self-existence, it is necessarily one, and 
hence Spinoza was consistent with his definition when he taught that 
substance is one; whereas, if substance be defined as self-activity, it 
is essentially individual, and at the same time necessarily manifold. 
The manifold individual substances are monads.  
 <!--             
508 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY  
 --><A NAME="p508"></a><p>

The <i>monads</i> are analogous to atoms; they are simple, indivisible, 
indestructible units.<sup><small><a name="n4"><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></a></small></sup> They differ from the atoms in this, that no 
two monads are alike. They differ also in respect to indivisibility; 
for the atom is not an absolutely indivisible point, while the monad is 
a metaphysical point, real and indivisible. Finally, they differ from 
atoms in this, that the atom is merely a material constituent of 
bodies, whereas the monad is immaterial, in so far, namely, as it is 
endowed with the power of representation.<p>

This <i>power of representation</i> is the essence, so to speak, of the 
monad. Leibniz is careful to distinguish between conscious and 
unconscious representation. Some monads, as for instance the human 
soul, are conscious of what they represent; others represent 
unconsciously; each monad, whether consciously or unconsciously, 
reflects every other monad in the universe. Each monad is therefore a 
microcosm, a multiplicity in unity, a mirror of all reality, in which 
an all-seeing eye might observe what is taking place all over the 
world.<sup><small><a name="n5"><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></a></small></sup> One monad differs from another merely in this, that while 
both represent all reality, one represents it more perfectly than the 
other. Now, since all the activity of the monad consists in 
representing, and since there are different degrees in the perfection 
with which a monad represents other monads, every monad must be dual, 
partly active and partly passive. Retaining the Aristotelian 
terminology, while modifying the meaning of the terms, Leibniz calls 
the passive element the <i>matter</i>, and the active element the 
<i>form</i>, or entelechy, of the monad. God alone represents all 
monads with perfect clearness, and is therefore pure actuality; all 
other monads represent imperfectly, and are therefore partly active 
(clearly representative) and partly passive (confusedly 
representative), that is, composed of form and matter. It was thus that 
Leibniz strove to reconcile the schoolmen with modern thought. 
 <!--
LEIBNIZ' DOCTRINE OF PREESTABLISHED HARMONY 509  
 --><A NAME="p509"></a><p>

Everything in the universe is composed of monads and everything takes 
its place in the scale of perfection according to the degree of 
clearness with which it represents other monads. Every monad is partly 
material and partly immaterial, so that from the lowest monad, which 
represents unconsciously, and shows its unconscious perception in the 
phenomena of attraction and repulsion, up to the highest created monad, 
which is the human soul, there is absolute continuity without 
interruption or unnecessary duplication. This is known as the <i>law of 
continuity</i>.<sup><small><a name="n6"><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></a></small></sup> Its counterpart is the <i>law of indiscernibles</i>. 
If there is no unnecessary duplication, there is no perfect similarity 
of forms, and, indeed, since no two monads represent the universe in 
exactly the same manner, no two are perfectly alike. If they were 
exactly alike they would not be two, but one; for it is the manner of 
representation that constitutes the individuality of a monad.<p>

<b>Pre&euml;stablished Harmony</b>. If each monad is a little universe 
in itself, reflecting every other monad, and individuated by its manner 
of representing, if it develops this power from the germs of activity 
inherent in itself, whence comes the correspondence of one 
representation with another, and the resulting harmony of the entire 
system of monads? Leibniz answers by postulating a <i>divine 
arrangement</i> by virtue of which the monads have from the beginning 
been so adapted to one another that the changes of one monad, although 
immanent, are parallel to the changes in every other monad of the 
cosmic system. This doctrine of preestablished harmony,<sup><small><a name="n7"><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></a></small></sup> which is 
germinally contained in Descartes' doctrine of the relations of the 
soul to the body, finds its most important application in psychology. 
Soul and body have no direct influx on each other, but, just as two 
clocks may be so perfectly constructed and so accurately adjusted that 
they keep exactly the same time, so it is arranged that the monads of 
the body put forth their activity in such a way that 
 <!--
510 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p510"></a>
 to each physical activity of the monads of the body there 
corresponds a psychical activity of the monad of the soul.<p>

When we inquire into the ultimate foundation of this harmony, and look 
for the reason of the divine arrangement on which the harmony of the 
universe depends, we find an answer in Leibniz' optimistic principle, 
the <i>lex melioris</i>. Of possible worlds God chose the best, and, 
even apart from the divine choice, the best would necessarily prevail 
over all other possible worlds, and become actual. This <i>lex 
melioris</i> is itself founded on the law of sufficient reason,<sup><small><a name="n8"><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></a></small></sup> 
that, namely, things are real when there is sufficient reason for their 
existence. The <i>law of sufficient reason</i> is, according to 
Leibniz, a law of thought as well as a law of being.<p> 

<b>Psychology</b>. From the definition of the monad it is clear that 
all created reality is partly material and partly immaterial, that 
there are no bodiless souls and no soulless bodies. Moreover, the law 
of continuity demands that the soul always think, that reason and sense 
differ merely in degree, and that sense-knowledge precede rational 
knowledge. Yet, although the soul, the "queen-monad," is akin to other 
monads, and although the law of continuity forbids a gap between the 
soul of man and lower forms, the human soul possesses intellectual 
knowledge by which it is discriminated from the souls of lower animals. 
Whence comes this intellectual knowledge? What is the origin of our 
ideas? In the <i>Nouveaux essais</i>, Leibniz not only contradicts 
Locke's doctrine that none of our ideas are innate,<sup><small><a name="n9"><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></a></small></sup> but lays down 
the contrary proposition and maintains that all our ideas are innate. 
He teaches that the soul has "no doors or windows" on the side facing 
the external world, that, consequently, all our knowledge is developed 
from germs of thought which are innate. The innateness of our ideas is, 
however, implicit rather than explicit. Ideas exist potentially in the 
mind, so that the acquisition of knowledge is the evolution of 
 <!--
LEIBNIZ' THEODICY 511
 --><A NAME="p511"></a>
 the virtually existent into the actually existent. To the principle, 
"Nihil est in intellectu quod prius non fuerit in sensu," Leibniz adds, 
"nisi ipse intellectus."<sup><small><a name="n10"><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Have our ideas, therefore, any objective value? Leibniz answers that 
they have, because the evolution of the psychic monad from virtual to 
actual knowledge is paralleled by the evolution of the cosmic monad in 
the outside world. Here, as elsewhere, the harmony is pre&euml;stablished.<p>

The <i>immortality of the soul</i> follows from its nature. The soul is 
a monad, self-active, self-sufficient (<i>suffisant &agrave; 
 lui-m&ecirc;me</i>), and is therefore as lasting as the universe 
itself.<p>

<b>Theodicy</b>. Leibniz' principal treatise on natural theology, the 
<i>Th&eacute;odic&eacute;e</i>,<sup><small><a name="n11"><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></a></small></sup> was composed for the purpose of 
refuting Bayle, who had tried to show that reason and faith are 
incompatible. The work is devoted, in a large measure, to the 
discussion of the problem of evil and to the defense of optimism.<p>

Leibniz' <i>arguments to prove the existence of God</i> may be reduced 
to three: (1) from the idea of God (a modification of Descartes' 
proof); (2) from the contingency of finite being; and (3) from the 
character of necessity which our ideas possess. Ideas possess not 
merely hypothetical but absolute necessity, -- a necessity which cannot 
be explained unless we grant that an absolutely necessary Being exists.<p>

When it is said that the idea of God plays a teleological rather than a 
scientific r&ocirc;le in Leibniz' system of thought, the meaning of 
this is that Leibniz is interested not so much in giving an account of 
the origin of the universe, as in discovering an absolute final cause 
towards which all created being tends. Indeed, we find that the 
idealist is always more inclined than is the empiricist to fall back on 
the teleological explanation, and in the philosophy of Leibniz the 
teleological concept is of especial  
 <!--
512 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p512"></a>
 importance as the foundation of the principle of sufficient reason. It 
is also of importance as affording a solution of the <i>problem of 
evil</i>, -- a problem to which Leibniz devoted much attention.<sup><small><a name="n12"><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></a></small></sup> He 
distinguishes <i>metaphysical evil</i>, which is mere limitation or 
finiteness, <i>physical evil</i>, which is suffering, and <i>moral 
evil</i>, which is sin. The ultimate source of all evil is the 
imperfection which of necessity attaches to limited existence, and 
which therefore must be permitted by God, although it is reduced by Him 
to the minimum, and made to serve a higher purpose, -- the beauty and 
harmony of the whole. Leibniz exhorts us to consider evil, not in its 
relation to parts of reality, but in its relation to the totality of 
being. "We can see," he writes, "only a very small part of the chain of 
things, and that part, moreover, which displays the most evil, and 
which is, therefore, well suited to exercise our faith and our love of 
God."<sup><small><a name="n13"><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. The philosophy of Leibniz cannot, like that 
of Locke, be characterized as superficial. It takes up, and attempts to 
solve, the most important questions of metaphysics and psychology. In 
spirit and tone, rather than in method and content, it is Platonic, 
that is, inspired by idealism and inclined to the poetic rather than to 
the scientific synthesis. And herein lies its principal defect: it is 
unreal. For although Leibniz was as fully alive as was any of his 
contemporaries to the importance of scientific study and experimental 
investigation, his philosophy is built, not on the data of experience, 
but on <i>a priori</i> definitions and principles. Yet we must not on 
this account underrate the importance of Leibniz as a speculative 
thinker. He rendered inestimable service to the cause of philosophy by 
setting himself in determined opposition to the current of empirical 
sensism. Besides, the study of his philosophy is healthful; it expands 
the mind, opens up new vistas of philosophic syntheses, and is an 
invaluable aid to the understanding of subsequent systems. 
 <!--
LIFE OF BERKELEY 513 
 --><A NAME="p513"></a><p>

In the philosophy of Berkeley we find another phase of idealism, an 
idealism carried to the point of the absolute denial of the reality of 
matter.<p>

BERKELEY<p>

<b>Life</b>. George Berkeley was born at Dysert, in County Kilkenny, 
Ireland, in the year 1685. After having made his elementary studies at 
Kilkenny, he went, in 1700, to Trinity College, Dublin, where, owing to 
the influence of Molyneux, the philosophy of Locke was in the 
ascendency. From the <i>Common-place Book</i>, in which, as early as 
1705, Berkeley began to set down his thoughts on philosophical 
problems, it appears that, while still at Trinity College, he had begun 
to study Descartes and Malebranche as well as Locke. In 1709 he 
published his <i>New Theory of Vision</i>, and in the following year, 
his <i>Principles of Knowledge</i>. In 1713 he went to London, where he 
formed the acquaintance of Steele, Collins, Swift, Pope, and Addison, 
and in the winter of the same year he visited P&egrave;re Malebranche 
at Paris. After several years spent in France and Italy, he returned to 
London in 1720, to find the whole country in a turmoil over the failure 
of the South Sea Scheme. It was this condition of affairs that prompted 
Berkeley to write his <i>Essay towards Preventing the ruin of Great 
Britain</i>. In 1721 he returned to Ireland to receive a deanery in the 
Established Church. From 1723 until 1731 he was occupied with his 
famous scheme for converting the American Indians and with the project 
of founding for that purpose a college in Bermuda. The two years which 
he spent at Whitehall, near Newport, Rhode Island, while waiting for 
the government grant promised by Sir Robert Walpole, afforded him an 
opportunity to continue his philosophical studies and to make the 
acquaintance of Samuel Johnson, through whom he may be said to have 
influenced Jonathan Edwards, the first representative of philosophy in 
America. On returning to London in 1731, Berkeley published his 
<i>Alciphron, or the Minute Philosopher</i>, a dialogue directed 
against the freethinkers (minute philosophers). In 1734 he was made 
bishop of Cloyne, in Cork. In that "serene corner" he combined the 
study of Plato with the advocacy of tar water as a cure for all human 
ills, publishing <i>Siris; A Chain of Philosophical Reflections and 
Inquiries concerning the Virtues of Tar Water</i>, etc. In 1752 he went 
Oxford, where he died in the following year.<p>

<b>Sources</b>. Berkeley's most important works are <i>An Essay toward 
a New Theory of Vision, A Treatise concerning the Principles of Human 
Knowledge, Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous, Alciphron, or 
the Minute Philosopher, the Analyst</i>, and <i>Siris</i>. The best 
edition of his  
 <!--
HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 514 
 --><A NAME="p514"></a>
 collected works is Fraser's (4 vols., Clarendon Press, 1871, new 
edition, 1901). Fraser's <i>Berkeley</i> (<i>Blackwood's Philosophical 
Classics</i>, Edinburgh and Philadelphia, 1894) is an excellent 
introduction to the study of Berkeley and his philosophy.<sup><small><a name="n14"><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></a></small></sup><p>

DOCTRINES<p>

<b>General Aim of Berkeley's Philosophy</b>. In the <i>Common-place 
Book</i>, of which mention has already been made, we find the following 
entry: "The chief thing I do, or pretend to do, is only <i>to remove 
the mist and veil of words</i>." The great obstacle to the discovery 
and acceptance of truth is, Berkeley thinks, the use of words which 
represent abstractions of the mind and prevent us from arriving at a 
knowledge of "things." Locke had indeed announced the principle that 
our knowledge extends only to ideas; but he straightway proceeded, 
Berkeley observes, to violate this very principle when he maintained 
that we know the qualities and powers of things outside the mind and 
have a "sensitive knowledge of their existence. Berkeley, therefore, 
starts where Locke had started, but he aims at going farther than Locke 
had gone, -- at establishing the truth of the conclusion that "all 
things are ideas," a conclusion which Berkeley regards as necessarily 
involved in Locke's principle that <i>our knowledge extends to ideas 
only</i>.<p>

<b>Immaterialism</b>. In his <i>New Theory of Vision</i>, Berkeley 
takes the first step in the direction of immaterialism. He shows, in 
the first place, that the only phenomena which we perceive by means of 
sight are colors, and that with these we associate the phenomena of 
touch and muscular movement. He then proceeds to show that the reason 
of the association is "custom," "experience," or "suggestion." The 
conclusion is that what we "see" in the world around us is far more 
dependent on mind than we are commonly aware of.  
 <!--
BERKELEY'S IMMATERIALISM 515  
 --><A NAME="p515"></a><p>

In the <i>Treatise concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge</i>, he 
takes up once more the problem of knowledge, and endeavors to show that 
what he had proved to be true of the phenomena of sight is true of the 
whole phenomenal world of sense; he tries, moreover, to find the reason 
for the custom, experience, or suggestion, by virtue of which we 
associate certain phenomena with certain others. He teaches that all 
the <i>qualities of matter, primary as well as secondary, resolve 
themselves into mind-dependent phenomena</i>. What, then, is it that 
groups these phenomena, for example, the color, size, shape, etc., of 
an orange, into those clusters or aggregates which we call "things"? 
The answer that phenomena are grouped together by an inert, lifeless 
matter is self-contradictory, because phenomena, being essentially 
 mind-dependent ideas, cannot exist in an unperceiving substance.<sup><small><a name="n15"><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></a></small></sup> 
Besides, matter is a mere abstraction, one of those words which merely 
serve to throw a "veil and mist" between the mind and a knowledge of 
truth. It is evident, therefore, that both the popular and the 
philosophical conceptions of matter are absurd. There is no material 
substratum of things; mind and mind-dependent phenomena alone exist; to 
be is to be perceived, -- <i>esse est percipi</i>.<p>

Yet the world is not a chaos, but a cosmos: there is a continual change 
and succession of phenomena, and in all this change and succession 
there is order and regularity. "There is, therefore, some cause of 
these ideas, whereon they depend. . . ,but it has been shown that there 
is no corporeal or material substance: it remains, therefore, that the 
cause of ideas is an incorporeal substance or spirit."<sup><small><a name="n16"><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></a></small></sup> Now, since 
the ideas actually perceived sense have no dependence on my will, it 
follows that it is not ny mind but the <i>eternal, uncreated spirit</i> 
that produces them.<sup><small><a name="n17"><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></a></small></sup><p>

Matter does not exist: spirit exists; the "external world" is spirit 
and the phenomena which spirit produces in the created 
 <!--
516 HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY 
 --><A NAME="p516"></a>
 mind; the only noumenal realities are God and human minds, -- these 
are the conclusions in which Berkeley's immaterialism is summed up. It 
follows that there are no secondary causes and that the laws of nature 
are really laws of the Eternal Spirit.<p>

<b>Theism</b>. In the <i>Dialogues</i>, and especially in the 
<i>Alciphron</i>, Berkeley undertook to show what is meant by the 
Eternal Spirit, to Whom he had, in his earlier treatises, referred the 
persistence and activity of the phenomena into which he bad analyzed 
the "external world." His line of reasoning may be described as 
<i>analogical</i>: just as we "see" men we "see" God. As we argue from 
the phenomena of sight, hearing, etc., to the existence of the human 
spirit in men, so we may argue from the phenomena of sense in general 
to the existence of the Infinite Spirit Whose thoughts (physical laws) 
are conveyed to us in the language of sense phenomena (physical 
qualities). Alciphron, the sceptic, confesses, "Nothing so much 
convinces me of the existence of another person as his speaking to me." 
To which Euphranor replies, "You have as much reason to think the 
Universal Agent, or God, speaks to your eyes as you can have for 
thinking any particular person speaks to your ears."<sup><small><a name="n18"><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></a></small></sup><p>

<b>Platonism</b>. The study of Plato, which, during his residence at 
Cloyne, Berkeley combined with the study of the medicinal properties of 
tar water, developed in the mind of our philosopher a growing 
<i>tendency towards a mystic view</i> of the problem of the ultimate 
reality of things. In the metaphysical portion of the <i>Siris</i>, 
which he published at this time, he occupies himself with the problem 
of showing how we may arrive at a higher knowledge of God than that 
afforded by sense-phenomena. In his <i>Dialogues</i> he was satisfied 
with refuting atheism by showing how God speaks to us in nature, but 
now he seeks a higher and deeper knowledge. The study of Plato has led 
him to the realization of the "uncertain, ever-fleeting, and changing 
nature" of sensible things, and to the consequent depreciation 
 <!--
HISTORICAL POSITION OF BERKELEY 517 
 --><A NAME="p517"></a>
 of sense-knowledge as being "properly no knowledge, but only 
opinion."<sup><small><a name="n19"><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></a></small></sup> Therefore he counsels the seeker after truth to cultivate 
the use of intellect and reason; to penetrate, by the exercise of these 
faculties, to a knowledge of the inner nature of things; and through 
<i>rational faith in causality</i>, to realize that "there runs a 
<i>chain</i> throughout the whole system of beings," and that, by 
ascending from what is lower to what is higher, the mind may reach a 
knowledge of the Highest Being. This is a lifelong task. "He that would 
make a real progress in knowledge must dedicate his age as well as his 
youth, the later growth as well as first fruits, at the altar of 
Truth."<p>

<b>Historical Position</b>. It was Berkeley's intention to remove "the 
mist and veil of words," and then from empirical principles to refute 
materialism and atheism. If matter does not exist, there is certainly 
no justification for materialism, and if all our ideas are produced in 
us by the Eternal Spirit, if every act of knowledge implies the 
existence of God, then atheism is undoubtedly irrational and untenable. 
Berkeley had not the least suspicion of the facility with which 
scepticism would take advantage of his immaterialism to reason away 
spirit as he himself had reasoned away material substance. "You see," 
says Philonous at the end of the third dialogue, "the water in yonder 
fountain; how it is forced upwards in a round column to a certain 
height, at which it breaks and falls back into the basin whence rose; 
its ascent as well as descent proceeding from the same uniform law or 
principle of <i>gravitation</i>. Just so, the same principles which, at 
first view, lead to skepticism, pursued to a certain point, bring men 
back to common sense."<sup><small><a name="n20"><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></a></small></sup> However, Berkeley built less wisely than he 
knew. He carried the principles of empiricism and idealism to a certain 
point, -- it is commonly said that he is to Locke what Spinoza is to 
Descartes, -- but at that point they were taken up by Hume and carried 
their logical conclusion, namely pan-phenomenalism.<p>
