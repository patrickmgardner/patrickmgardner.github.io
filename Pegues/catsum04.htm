XII. OF THE GIFT OF WISDOM WHICH CORRESPONDS TO CHARITY; 
AND OF THE SIN TO WHICH IT IS OPPOSED<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Is there a gift of the Holy Ghost that corresponds to the virtue of charity?</i><p>

Yes; and it is the gift of wisdom which is the most
perfect of all the gifts (XLV.).<p>

<i>What is the gift of wisdom?</i><p>

The gift of wisdom is that gift of the Holy Ghost which
effects that man, under the direct action of the Holy
Spirit, judges of all things by reference to the highest
and most sublime of all causes, which is the wisdom
itself of God in so far as it is made manifest to us by
faith (XLV. 1).<p>

<i>How is this gift of wisdom distinguished from the intellectual virtue of the same name, or from the gifts of intuition or insight, of knowledge and of counsel, and in so far as these latter are distinguished from the intellectual virtues which are also called intuition or insight, knowledge and prudence?</i><p>

In a few words these differences may be summed
up thus: On the part of the intellect, in things of faith,
there are several acts essentially distinct to which 
correspond the virtues or their respective gifts which are
themselves distinct from each other.<p>

The very essence of faith is the act that assents to
things revealed by God. Upon this act of assenting,
which is the principal act, there ensue certain secondary
or complementary acts that perfect the intellect in the
same order of the things of faith; and these acts are
understanding and judging. The act of understanding
or perceiving is, generically speaking, one only, and to it
corresponds the intellectual virtue of insight or intuition,
and in a higher scale of perfection the gift of understanding. 
The act of judging is manifold, for it is
<!--
OF CHARITY 133
-->
threefold: this act may judge of things, in general, 
according to divine reasons or according to human; or it may
judge of things by the application of its knowledge to
things themselves in particular. In the first case, the
intellectual virtue which corresponds to the act of
judging is called the intellectual virtue of wisdom;
and, in a higher scale, the gift of wisdom. In the second
case, it is called the intellectual virtue of knowledge; and,
in a higher scale, the gift of knowledge. In the third
case, it is called the intellectual virtue of prudence;
and, in a higher scale, the gift of counsel.<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>Is there anything worthy of note in this doctrine?</i><p>

Yes; we owe this teaching to St. Thomas Aquinas.
He himself tells us that he did not perceive the harmony
and the beauty of this doctrine except after many years
of study and reflexion (VIII. 6).<p>

<i>Among these virtues and gifts that perfect the mind in its knowledge of the truth, is there one which, in perfection, holds the first place?</i><p>

Yes, and it is the virtue of faith upon which all the
others depend; indeed, it is the r&ocirc;le of the other virtues
and gifts to assist in the knowledge of this truth.<p>

<i>Which is the most perfect after the virtue of faith?</i><p>

After the virtue of faith the most perfect is the gift of
wisdom.<p>

<i>In what does this perfection of the gift of wisdom consist, in particular with regard to the gift of knowledge?</i><p>

It consists in this, that by the gift of knowledge we judge
of things divinely by referring them to their immediate and
created causes; whereas by the gift of wisdom we judge
of all things divinely by referring them to the highest of
all causes, that, namely, which itself is independent of
all causes and from which all other causes depend.<p>

<i>It is then by the gift of wisdom that one attains to the highest degree of knowledge to be had on earth?</i><p>

Yes.
<!--
134 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Is there any sin which is opposed to this gift that is so supreme and beautiful?</i><p>

Yes, and it is that lack of wisdom which consists in
judging finally of a thing without taking into account,
or perhaps even by contemning, the sovereign counsels of
God.<p>

<i>What ought this sin to be called?</i><p>

There is only one fitting name for this sin: it is abject
stupidity or supreme folly (XLVI. 1).<p>

<i>Is this sin often found among men?</i><p>

Yes; for, practically speaking, it is the sin of all those
who lead a life apart from or in defiance of the things of
God.<p>

<i>Is there an insuperable opposition between the wisdom of the world and the wisdom of God?</i><p>

Yes, for each regards the other as folly.<p>

<i>In what does the opposition consist?</i><p>

It consists in this, that the world esteems those wise
who arrange their life in such a way as to lack none of the
things of this world, and such people seek their last end
in the good things of this life in contempt of the Good of
God which is promised us in another life; whereas the
wisdom of the children of God consists in subordinating
all the things of the present life to the possession of God
in heaven.<p>

<i>Are these two kinds of life distinct necessarily in every way?</i><p>

Yes, because the last end of each is absolutely different;
and it is the last end which rules all in a life.<p>

<i>It is then only by practising the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity and cultivating the corresponding gifts that man can tend towards his true final end, and is able as it behoves to view that last end in all the acts of his life?</i><p>

Yes, of a truth this is so.

XIII. OF THE MORAL VIRTUES: OF PRUDENCE, ITS NATURE AND ELEMENTS,
AND OF ITS ATTENDANT VIRTUES; OF THE SPECIES OF PRUDENCE, NAMELY,
INDIVIDUAL, DOMESTIC, POLITICAL, AND MILITARY<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>What is the first of the moral virtues?</i><p>

The virtue of prudence (XLVII .).<p>

<i>What is prudence?</i><p>

Prudence is a principle of moral action that perfects
man's practical reason, so that in every action he dispose
and order all things as it behoves, by commanding himself 
and those under him to do at each moment what is
necessary for the perfect realization of every virtue
(XLVII. 1-9).<p>

<i>Is this virtue of great importance in man's life?</i><p>

Yes, for without it there could be no virtuous act in
man's life at all (XLVII. 13).<p>

<i>If man has this virtue in its perfect state, can he lead a perfectly virtuous life?</i><p>

Yes (XLVII. 14).<p>

<i>Why can prudence effect this?</i><p>

Because in prudence all the other virtues are united,
each single one being dependent upon prudence just as
prudence is dependent upon them.<p>

<i>In order for this virtue of prudence to be perfect, are certain conditions necessary as regards its proper act?</i><p>

Yes.<p>

<i>What are these conditions?</i><p>

They are, first of all, the elements which constitute it,
without which it cannot exist at all; secondly, certain
other virtues which are ordained to prudence and which
prepare the way for its proper act are necessaiy and
lastly, the division of prudence according to the diversity
of objects to be governed or ruled (XLVIII.-LI.).
<!--
136 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What are the elements which constitute prudence?</i><p>

They are these: Memory of past things; insight into
the principles of action whether in general or in particular; 
docility and respect for what has been determined
by the wise; astuteness in order to discover a right
course of action at a time when recourse to another is not
possible; the healthy exercise of the reason applying,
as is meet, the principles of the action to be performed
to the manifold individual conditions of the action itself;
foresight at the moment of acting as regards the substance
of each act in particular; circumspection as regards all the
accompanying circumstances of the act; precaution
against obstacles or against whatsoever might endanger
the happy result of the act (XLIX. 1-8).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>What are the virtues ordained to prudence and which prepare the way for its proper act?</i><p>

They are these: The virtue of good counsel; and the
two virtues which ensure a right judgment: the one
which regards the ordinary events of life and respects
the established laws; the other which regards extraordinary 
events, and in this case recourse must be had
to the higher sources of the natural law alone (LI. 1-4).<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>What is the act proper to prudence called?</i><p>

It is called the command (XLVII. 8).<p>

<i>But does it not seem that the virtue of prudence is not so much the virtue that commands but rather that counsels, since a man is called "prudent" who takes counsel before acting?</i><p>

A man is called "prudent" by reason of the counsel
he takes before accepting the command; but prudence
proper is in the act itself of giving a command with
decision at a time when one has to act (XLVII. 8, <i>Obj.</i> 2).
<!--
OF PRUDENCE 137
--><p>

<center>(E)</center><p>

<i>Are there several species of prudence?</i><p>

Yes, there are as many species of prudence as there are
species of commanded acts; acts, that is, that present
some special difficulty in the order of virtue.<p>

<i>How many species are there of acts of command?</i><p>

There are four: the act of command as regards oneself,
the act of command in a family; in a society; and in
the army (L. 1-4).<p>

<i>What are these different species of prudence called?</i><p>

They are called individual prudence, domestic, political,
and military (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<center>(F)</center><p>

<i>What is individual prudence?</i><p>

It is that necessary to each individual person for
the leading of a virtuous life for his own individual good.<p>

<center>(G)</center><p>

<i>What is domestic prudence?</i><p>

It is that necessary to every member of a family, so
that each, under the head of the family, concur in the
common welfare of the family (L. 3).<p>

<center>(H)</center><p>

<i>What is political prudence?</i><p>

It is that necessary to the head of a society, whether
an independent city or a nation, for the governing thereof
as it behoves.<p>

<i>Is it sufficient for the well-being of a city or of a nation that he or those that govern be prudent?</i><p>

No, there must be a proportionate prudence also in the
people governed (L. 2).<p>

<i>In what does this prudence of the governed consist?</i><p>

It consists in this, that each member of a society
should strive by his correspondence to the orders of
the government to further the common interests of the
society (L. 2).
<!--
138 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
(I)<p>

<i>Is the object of military prudence also for the furtherance of the interests of the common good?</i><p>

Yes, military prudence is of great importance for the
well-being of the society, since it is through the able
commanding of the officers and the perfect discipline
of the rank and file that the country defends its rights
and repels the unjust invasions of an enemy (L. 4).<p>

<hr><p>
XIV. OF THE GIFT OF COUNSEL WHICH CORRESPONDS TO PRUDENCE<p>

<i>What is the gift of the Holy Ghost that corresponds to prudence?</i><p>

The gift of counsel (LII.).<p>

<i>What is this gift?</i><p>

It is a supernatural perfection of man's practical reason
that makes him docile and ready under the action of the
Holy Ghost to take counsel and to sift well everything
that in life relates to salvation; this gift is therefore of the
greatest help to man, for even though he possess all the
acquired and the infused virtues he cannot do without
this gift, which helps him to make a perfect judgment
and act of command, since he is for ever liable to err.
amidst the complexity of circumstances that accompany
every human act (LII. 1, 2).<p>

<i>Will the gift of counsel exist also in heaven?</i><p>

Yes, but in a way much more perfect (LII. 3).<p>

<i>In what more perfect way will it exist there?</i><p>

In this way: the minds of the blessed in heaven will be
wondrously enlightened by God as regards all human
activity in so far as it harmonizes with the final end
which is already in their possession; and this, whether
there be question of those acts which, for evermore, shall
be produced in virtue of the actual possession of the
final end; or there be question of the help the blessed
are destined to give until the last day, to those on earth
that they also may gain heaven (LII. 3).

XV. OF THE SINS THAT ARE OPPOSED TO PRUDENCE, VIZ., OF IMPRUDENCE;
HASTINESS; LACK OF THOUGHT; INCONSTANCY; NEGLIGENCE; FALSE PRUDENCE; 
PRUDENCE OF THE FLESH; SLYNESS; DECEIT; FRAUD; FALSE SOLICITUDE<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Are there any sins opposed to prudence?</i><p>

Yes, and some of them are opposed to prudence on
account of defect, whereas others are opposed on account
of excess.<p>

<i>What are those sins called that are opposed to prudence on account of defect?</i><p>

They go under the general name of imprudence (LIII.).<p>

<i>What is imprudence considered in this general way?</i><p>

Imprudence, in general, is every act of the practical
reason which runs counter to the rules of prudence
(LIII. 1).<p>

<i>Can an act of imprudence be a mortal sin?</i><p>

Yes, this can be so whenever man's reason acts contrary
divine laws; such a one who spurns the laws of God
acts with rashness (LIII. 1).<p>

<i>When is the sin only venial?</i><p>

When man acts contrary to God's laws but without
contempt and without peril to what is necessary for his
salvation (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>Is any other sin linked up with the sin of imprudence?</i><p>

Yes, indeed every other sin, for no sin would ever
come to be if there were no act of imprudence; the latter
sin, however, is distinct from and can exist apart from other
sins (LIII. 2).<p>

<i>In what case does this sin of imprudence exist apart from other sins?</i><p>

In every case when, without doing anything in itself
bad or even when doing something that is good, one acts
<!--
140 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA" 
-->
with hastiness, or with lack of thought, or with 
inconstancy, or with negligence (LIII. 2).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What is hastiness?</i><p>

Hastiness is a sin against prudence, which consists in
not making sufficient enquiry before acting as regards
when one should act and in what manner one should
act (LIII. 3).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>What is lack of thought?</i><p>

It is a sin against the rectitude of judgment; and it
consists in despising or in neglecting to consider what is
necessary to ensure a right judgment in conduct (LIII. 4).<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>What is inconstancy?</i><p>

Inconstancy is a defect in the very act of commanding
which is the proper act of prudence; and in very fact
the inconstant man is he who for lack of a firm command
does not effect what he had resolved upon after enquiry
and the taking of counsel (LIII. 5).<p>

<center>(E)</center><p>

<i>Is this the only defect which touches the principal act of prudence?</i><p>

No, there is also another called negligence, which is
opposed to the principal act of prudence on the side
of solicitude which this act entails (LIV.).<p>

<i>What is negligence?</i><p>

It is the want of readiness in putting into execution,
by way of command, the resolutions of the judgment,
made after due enquiry and counsel, as regards the
attainment of the end of virtue (LIV. 1).<p>

<i>Is negligence a great sin?</i><p>

Yes; for it paralyzes all virtuous action; at times it
hinders a virtuous act altogether, or it effects that the act
is done only half-heartedly, in such wise that it loses most
of its worth and merit (LIV. 3).
<!--
OF PRUDENCE 141
--><p>

<i>When negligence reaches also to the external act by enervating it, what is it called?</i><p>

It is called laziness or torpidity (LIV. 2, <i>Obj.</i> 1).<p>

<i>Are these two sins distinct from negligence properly so-called?</i><p>

Yes, for strictly the sin of negligence consists in the
want of readiness and energy in the act of command in so
far as this defect is due to the interior weakness of the
will (LIV. 2).<p>

<i>Is it important to keep careful watch over the sin of negligence?</i><p>

Yes, it is of extreme importance, for negligence attacks
the very root of virtuous action and is opposed to the
principal act of the practical reason from which the
realization of every virtuous act depends.<p>

<i>Is negligence sometimes a mortal sin?</i><p>

It is always a mortal sin when it affects whatever
is of precept that concerns salvation; even when it is not
a mortal sin, unless one is on one's guard, it causes a
spiritual sickness that leads inevitably to spiritual 
corruption and death (LIV. 3).<p>

<center>(F)</center><p>

<i>What are the sins that are opposed to prudence by excess?</i><p>

They are called false prudence and false solicitude (LV.).<p>

<i>What is false prudence?</i><p>

It is that complexity of sins which vitiate the true
character of prudence by seeking an end that is bad,
or by exceeding the limits of prudence in choosing
wrong means to an end (LV. 1-5).<p>

<i>What is that which vitiates the true character of prudence by seeking an end that is bad?</i><p>

It is called the prudence of the flesh (LV. 1).<p>

<i>In what does it consist?</i><p>

It consists in disposing our life in the interests of the
flesh which is served as an end (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>Is this a mortal sin?</i><p>

Yes, whenever the interests of the flesh are looked upon
as the last end; if, however, these interests are not looked
<!--
542 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
upon as the last end and as not ordained to the last true
end of human life, then the sin is only venial (LV. 2).<p>

<center>(G)</center><p>

<i>The sins that exceed prudence as to the means employed, what are they?</i><p>

They are the sins of slyness, with which are connected
deceit and fraud (LV. 3-5).<p>

<i>What is slyness?</i><p>

It is that false prudence which consists in using false
and deceitful means whether it be question of a good
or of a bad end for which they are used (LV. 3).<p>

<i>What is deceit?</i><p>

Deceit consists in effecting by words or by deeds
the projects suggested by slyness (LV. 4).<p>

<i>What is the difference between deceit and fraud?</i><p>

The difference comes to this, that although both are
concerned with the projects suggested by slyness, deceit
puts into execution these projects whether it be by word
or by deed, whereas fraud is confined to the execution of
some project by deed only.<p>

<i>Are slyness, deceit, and fraud the same as lying?</i><p>

No, for the lie takes falsehood as its end; whereas
the three sins above mentioned take it as a means. If
by chance the latter deceive, this is only to gain some end
in view.<p>

<i>What follows from this difference?</i><p>

It follows that lying is a special sin in the order of the
moral virtues, a sin that is in opposition to the virtue of
telling the truth only; whereas slyness, deceit, and fraud
can be in divers genera of sins, not that they constitute any
one sin in particular in the order of the moral virtues,
but only in the order of prudence whose characteristic it
is to be included in all the other virtues.
<!--
OF PRUDENCE 143 
--><p>

<center>(H)</center><p>

<i>What is the sin of false solicitude?</i><p>

By this is meant that solicitude the sole object of
which is the seeking after temporal things, or after some
empty vanity, or that which makes one fear inordinately
the loss of these things (LV. 6).<p>

<i>Is there a solicitude for temporal things that is good?</i><p>

Yes, it is that solicitude for temporal things that seeks
them in a moderate way, by ordaining them to the end of
charity, and by trusting to the providence of God (LV. 6).<p>

<i>What is to be said of that solicitude which regards the future?</i><p>

This solicitude is always bad when it usurps what
should be left to the future (LV. 7).<p>

<i>When is solicitude for the future good?</i><p>

That solicitude is good when it contents itself to provide
for the future in so far as the future depends upon those
things which should occupy the attention here and now;
leaving alone for future consideration the things that are
future (LV. 7).<p>

<hr><p>
XVI. OF THE PRECEPTS RELATING TO PRUDENCE<p>

<i>Is there any precept among those of the Decalogue which corresponds to the virtue of prudence?</i><p>

No; for the precepts of the Decalogue formulating
what has reference to the natural reason should bear
upon the ends of human life which are the proper object
of the virtues, and not upon the means which are the
proper object of the virtue of prudence. But all the
precepts are related to prudence in that the latter directs
all the acts of the virtues (LVI. 1).<p>

<i>Since then the precepts are directly related to the virtue of prudence, are they as it were complementary and of later origin?</i><p>

Yes; and they are to be found in other places in the
<!--
144 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
inspired books, even in the Old Testament; and later
on in the New Testament (LVI. 2).<p>

<i>Are there not even in the Old Testament certain precepts of particular consequence that forbid certain sins opposed to the virtue of prudence?</i><p>

Yes; they are the precepts relating to slyness, deceit,
and fraud (LVI. 2).<p>

<i>Why are these sins particularly prohibited?</i><p>

Because in their external application they militate
against justice, which all the precepts of the Decalogue
safeguard (LVI. 2).<p>

<hr><p>
XVII. OF JUSTICE AND ITS NATURE; OF LAW; OF NATURAL LAW; OF POSITIVE,
PRIVATE, PUBLIC, NATIONAL, INTERNATIONAL, CIVIL, AND ECCLESIASTICAL 
LAW -- OF LEGAL JUSTICE AND OF PARTICULAR -- OF THE SINS OPPOSED THERETO<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>After the virtue of prudence, is the virtue of justice the most important of the other virtues?</i><p>

Yes, after the virtue of prudence, which occupies a
place apart in the order of the moral virtues and without
which no one single virtue can exist, the most important
among the other virtues is the virtue of justice (LVII.-CXXI.).<p>

<i>What is the virtue ofjustice?</i><p>

It is that virtue which has for its object right or the
just (LVII. 1).<p>

<i>What is meant by this?</i><p>

By this is meant that the object of justice is to make
respected among men those relations which are founded
upon the respect due to existence and possession, which
are legitimately the privilege of every human being
(LVII. 1).
<!--
OF JUSTICE 145
--><p>

<i>But how does one know that the existence or the possession of any one particular person is legitimately of such a nature or should be of such a nature?</i><p>

One knows this by what natural reason tells 
concerning each man; also by that which, by common
consent, is determined by the reason of different men;
and also by the reason of those who are in authority
whose office it is to regulate such matters (LVII. 2-4).<p>

<i>What is that law called which is founded upon what the natural reason dictates?</i><p>

It is called the natural law (LVII. 2).<p>

<i>And that law which is determined by the common accord of different men, or that which is determined by those in authority whose duty it is to make regulations concerning the relations between men?</i><p>

It is called positive law, which is divided into private
law and public law; the latter is further divided into
national and international according as there is question
of private conventions or of the laws of a country, or of
the laws agreed upon and established between different
nations (LVII. 2).<p>

<i>What is the civil law and ecclesiastical law?</i><p>

Civil law treats of the relations between men in so far
as they are determined by the civil authority; ecclesiastical
law in so far as they are determined by the ecclesiastical
authority.<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>Does the right upon which the virtue of justice bears confine itself only to the relations of individuals of a society among themselves; or does it refer also to the relations of individuals with the society?</i><p>

It embraces both species of relations (LVIII. 5-7).<p>

<i>What law is the first called?</i><p>

It is called particular justice (LVIII. 7).<p>

<i>And the second?</i><p>

Legal justice (LVIII. 5).
<!--
146 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>What is precisely the virtue of justice?</i><p>

It is that perfection of man's will which inclines him
to desire in all things, spontaneously and unceasingly,
the good of the society of which he is a part; and also
to desire that each should have what is his due (LVIII. 1).<p>

<i>What is the sin that is opposed to this virtue called?</i><p>

It is called injustice; which, now, is in opposition to
legal justice, spurning the common good which legal
justice seeks to promote; and, now, is in opposition
to particular justice which seeks to maintain what is right
and just among individuals (LIX.).<p>

<i>In what does the sin of injustice precisely consist?</i><p>

It consists in this, that with full knowledge one attacks
the right of another; that is to say, that one acts contrary
to what a rational will should naturally desire (LIX. 3).<p>

<hr><p>
XVIII. OF THE ACT OF PARTICULAR JUSTICE, VIZ.,JUDGMENT<p>

<i>Has the virtue of justice an act which is particularly proper to it, especially in so far as it is particular justice?</i><p>

Yes, and this act is called the judgment, which consists
in determining precisely what is due to each person;
whether this judgment be given in an official capacity
between two parties at law, or whether for love of right
in itself the judgment be given for all and for all time
in the desire to appreciate even within the soul the rights
of everyone to existence and possession (LX.).<p>

<i>Ought this judgment, which is the act of the virtue of justice, to interpret doubtful things in a good sense?</i><p>

Yes, whenever it has reference to our neighbour and
his'acts justice should never either internally or externally
judge in a bad sense so long as there remains any doubt
about the motives of our neighbour and his acts (LX. 4).

<i>But if, however, there is doubt with regard to things that might be hurtful to oneself or to others, may not one be suspicious and take precautions?</i><p>

Yes, legal justice, and prudence, and charity demand
that when there is question of some evil to ourselves or
to others we should be on our guard even though our
suspicions may arise from conjecture only (LX. 4, <i>Obj.</i> 3).<p>

<i>But even in this case is no reservation to be made?</i><p>

Yes, even when it is right to take precautions one must
not either in words or in thought pronounce a formal
judgment which is prejudicial to another (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

XIX. OF PARTICULAR JUSTICE, AND OF ITS SPECIES: 
OF DISTRIBUTIVE AND OF COMMUTATIVE JUSTICE<p>

<i>Does particular justice comprise several species?</i><p>

Yes, it comprises two species: distributive justice and
commutative justice (LXI. 1).<p>

<i>What is distributive justice?</i><p>

It is that species of particular justice which safeguards
fairness in the relations that exist between the society
and the individuals of which the society is composed
(LXI. 1).<p>

<i>What is commutative justice?</i><p>

It is that species of particular justice which safeguards
fairness in the relations of men with each other in the
same society (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>If one considers the individual members of a society as parts ordained to the whole, what kind of justice safeguards fairness between the individuals and the society?</i><p>

This is the great virtue called legal justice (LXI. 1, <i>Obj.</i> 4).

XX. OF THE ACT OF COMMUTATIVE JUSTICE, VIZ., OF RESTITUTION<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>What is the proper act of commutative justice?</i><p>

It is called restitution (LXII. 1).<p>

<i>What is restitution?</i><p>

It is that act whereby the right relation between one
man and another is re-established, whenever this relation
has been broken by the fact that one of the two has not
received his due (LXI. 1).<p>

<i>Restitution then does not always imply an act of injustice?</i><p>

No, for also the virtuous man may make restitution,
by restoring what belongs to another immediately and
with scrupulousness when such thing ought to be restored.<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What are the essential rules of restitution?</i><p>

The following, and they are those which natural equity
dictates. By restitution, that which another lacks or
might lack unfairly is given to him or restored to him.
That which is restored must be the thing itself or its
exact equivalent, neither more nor less, in so far as the
person possessed it previously, whether actually or virtually: 
further, one must take into account whatever change
may have taken place in the thing restored and make
proper restitution as the case may be; and further, one
must take into account the consequences that are or were
prejudicial to the owner of the object due to the detention
thereof. An object to be restored must be given back
to the owner and not to any other person unless the latter
be acting for the owner. He, whosoever he may be, who
is in possession of an object to be restored is the one who
must make restitution thereof, or whosoever is the one
who is responsible for the act which was an offence
against justice. Restitution must be made without delay,
except in the case when the immediate restoration of an
object is impossible (LXII. 2-8).

XXI. OF THE SINS OPPOSED TO DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE: OF THE RESPECT OF
PERSONS; OF THE SINS OPPOSED TO COMMUTATIVE JUSTICE; OF HOMICIDE; 
OF CAPITAL PUNISHMENT; OF MUTILATION; OF FLOGGING; AND OF IMPRISONMENT<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>What is the sin opposed to distributive justice ?</i><p>

It is the sin of the respect of persons (LX III.).<p>

<i>What is meant by this sin?</i><p>

It is the fact of giving something or of refusing to give
to a person what is for his good, or to impose something
on a person that is burdensome or difficult, and this not
by a consideration of his merits or demerits but merely
because the person is such and such a one (LXIII. 1).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What sins are opposed to commutative justice?</i><p>

These sins are divided into two groups (LXIV.-LXXVIII.).<p>

<i>What are those of the first group?</i><p>

They are those which touch our neighbour in which
his own will has no part (LXIV.-LXXVI.).<p>

<i>What is the first of these sins?</i><p>

It is homicide, which affects our neighbour by deed, as
regards his greatest good, viz., by taking his life (LXIV.).<p>

<i>Is this a great sin?</i><p>

It is the greatest sin against our neighbour.<p>

<i>Is it ever permitted to attempt our neighbour's life?</i><p>

No, never.<p>

<i>Is it never permitted to take away a man's life?</i><p>

It is never permitted to take away a man's life, unless
through some crime, he has merited death (LXIV. 2, 6).
<!--
150 CATECHISM OF TEE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>When a man through crime merits to lose his life, who alone has the right to deprive him of life?</i><p>

Only the public authority has the right to do this
(LXIV. 2).<p>

<i>Whence does the public authority derive this right?</i><p>

It derives this right from the duty incumbent upon it
of guarding over the common good of the society (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>Does the common good of the society sometimes demand that a man be put to death?</i><p>

Yes, because there may be no other efficient way of
putting a stop to the crimes committed within the society;
or because the public feeling demands such satisfaction
for the expiation of certain crimes that are hateful and
revolting (LXIV. 2).<p>

<i>Is it only for crime that a man can be put to death by the public authority?</i><p>

Yes, for this reason only (LXIV. 6).<p>

<i>May public interest sometimes justify the putting to death of an innocent person?</i><p>

No, never, because the supreme good in a society is
always the good of virtue (LXIV. 6).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Has an individual, in order to defend himself, or his belongings, the right to take the life of the one who attacks him?</i><p>

No, an individual has never the right to do this unless
there be question of losing his own life or the life of those
in his charge, and there be absolutely no defence other
than that which entails the death of his assailant; further,
in thus defending himself he must in no way whatever
intend the death of his assailant, but only intend to defend
his life or that of others in his charge (LXIV. 7).<p>

<i>What are the other sins against our neighbour that touch his person?</i><p>

They are mutilation, which attacks the integrity of
his person; flogging, which inflicts pain on his body; and
<!--
OF JUSTICE 151
-->
imprisonment, which deprives him of the freedom of his
person (LXV. 1-3).<p>

<i>When are these acts sinful?</i><p>

Whenever they are done by those who have no authority,
or who, having authority, exceed the just bounds (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<hr><p>
XXII. OF THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY, AND OF THE DUTIES IT ENTAILS -- 
OF THE VIOLATION OF THIS RIGHT, VIZ., OF THEFT AND ROBBERY<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Besides the sins that attack the person of our neighbour, what is the greatest sin that can be committed against him by deed?</i><p>

It is the sin which touches what belongs to him (LXVI.).<p>

<i>Has man the right to possess anything?</i><p>

Yes, and to use it as he wills, without the interference
of anyone else (LXVI. 2).<p>

<i>Whence comes this right?</i><p>

It comes from the very nature of man himself; for
since he is a rational being and made to live in society,
his own good, the good of his family, and the good of
society absolutely demand that the right of property be
safeguarded (LXVI. 1, 2).<p>

<i>But why do these divers goods demand the safeguarding of the right of property?</i><p>

It is because the right to possess is a condition of man's
liberty, it is, moreover, for the family, the way <i>par 
excellence</i> whereby it is upheld in all its rights and is the
guarantee of its existence in the society; further, this right
of property effects that in the society itself more care is
taken of things to the exclusion in a great measure of
disagreements and litigations (LXVI. 2).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>Does the right of property entail certain duties?</i><p>

Yes, it entails certain grave duties.
<!--
152 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>What are these duties?</i><p>

They are, first of all, the duty of taking care of one's
belongings and of doing one's best to promote their
productiveness. Then, according to the productiveness
of these things, one must in due measure, after supplying
one's own wants, use these things for the good of others
who are in the society. There is indeed a duty in social
justice of giving to those who are in need the superfluity
of one's possessions, or of employing the labour of others,
or of giving facilities for such labour to those who by
this means earn their livelihood, and this one must do for
the love of the public good generally. The state in the
interests of the public good has the right to make levies
on the goods of individuals as regards whatever it judges
necessary or useful for the good of the society, and 
individual members are bound to conform to the laws made
by the state for this end; there is indeed for them an
obligation to comply therewith in strict justice. But
the good of individuals and the need of supplying their
necessities does not oblige with the same rigour, for there
is no positive human law constraining one to this. On
the other hand, the natural law demands this in all rigour.
Not to succour the needy with the superfluity of one's
possessions is to act in direct opposition to the natural
law; this obligation enforced by the natural law takes on
a sacred character through divine positive law, especially
through the law contained in the Gospels. God Himself
preached this personally in order to impress more on
the minds of men what He had already graven on their
hearts (LXVI. 2-7; XXXII. 5, 6).<p>

<i>If such are the duties of those who possess towards their fellow-men, what are the duties of the latter in relation to the former?</i><p>

They must respect the property of those who possess
and never take anything against their owner's will
(LXVI. 5, 8).
<!--
153 OF JUSTICE
--><p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>What is that act called which consists in taking the property of another against his will?</i><p>

It is called theft or robbery (LXVI. 3, 4).<p>

<i>What is theft?</i><p>

Theft is to appropriate the property of another
secretly (LXVI. 3).<p>

<i>And what is robbery?</i><p>

Robbery is the appropriation of another's property by
violence (LXVI. 4).<p>

<i>Which is the graver of these two sins?</i><p>

Robbery is more grave than theft; but theft, in itself,
is always a mortal sin unless the thing taken is of small
consequence (LXVI. 9).<p>

XXIII. OF THE SINS AGAINST JUSTICE BY WORDS; OF THE JUDGMENT 
PRONOUNCED BY A JUDGE; OF THE SINS ON THE PART OF THE ACCUSED AND OF
THE ACCUSER; AND ON THE PART OF THE WITNESS AND OF THE ADVOCATE<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Are there any sins against justice that are committed by words?</i><p>

Yes, and these are twofold: those that are committed in
the solemn act of judgment; and those that are committed
in the ordinary course of life (LXVII.-LXXVI.)<p>

<i>What is the first sin that can be committed in the solemn act of judgment?</i><p>

It is the sin of the judge who judges unjustly (LXVII.).<p>

<i>What is required of a judge that he may judge justly ?</i><p>

He should consider himself as it were a living justice,
whose duty it is to restore in the name of the society
which he represents the injured right to whosoever has
recourse to his authority (LXVII. 1).
<!--
154 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What then is the duty of a judge in the fulfilment of his office?</i><p>

It is his duty to judge those only who come under his
jurisdiction: moreover, in drawing up his judgment he
must take as his basis the facts of the case as set forth
by the parties in litigation, it being allowable for him to
interfere only if one of the parties lodges a complaint; but
he must always dispense justice in its integrity, not showing 
to the culprit pity falsely so-called, whatever be the
penalty in the name of the law established by God or by
men he may have to pronounce against him (LXVII. 2-4.).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>What is the second sin which may be committed against justice in the solemn act of judgment?</i><p>

It is the sin of those who are wanting in their duty as
accusers, or who accuse unjustly (LXVIII.).<p>

<i>What is meant by the duty of accusing?</i><p>

By this is meant that duty incumbent upon every man
living in a society who knows of some evil that assails the
society itself; he is thereby bound to bring to the notice of
the judge the author of the evil so that justice may be
done; he is free from this obligation only if he is unable
to establish the truth of the fact juridically (LXVIII. 1).<p>

<i>When is an accusation unjust?</i><p>

Accusation is unjust when from simple malice one
falsely imputes crimes to another; or if when one is called
upon to give evidence one does not follow up the accusation 
according as justice demands, either by making overtures 
to the opposite party or by unreasonably declining
to follow up the accusation (LXVIII. 3).<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>What is the third sin committed against justice in the act of judgment?</i><p>

It is the sin of the accused who refuses to conform
to the rules of the law (LXIX.).
<!--
OF JUSTICE 155
--><p>

<i>What are these rules to which the accused must conform, under pain of sin against justice?</i><p>

They are that he is bound to tell the truth to the judge
when the latter, in virtue of his authority as judge, 
interrogates him; and that he must never defend himself
by fraudulent means (LXIX. 1, 2).<p>

<i>If he is condemned, may not the accused decline to accept the judgment by making an appeal?</i><p>

The accused, who is not allowed to defend himself by
fraudulent means, has no right to make an appeal from a
just judgment with the sole object of retarding the putting
into execution of the judgment. He may make an appeal
only when he is the victim of manifest injustice. Even
then he must use his right within the limits established by
the law (LXIX. 3).<p>

<i>Has one who is condemned to death the right to resist the sentence of condemnation?</i><p>

The man who is unjustly condemned to death can
resist even by violence provided no scandal is given. But
if he be justly condemned, he is bound to submit to the
penalty without resistance whatsoever; it is, however,
permissible to make good his escape should he find the
means, for no one is bound to concur in one's own
punishment (LXIX. 4).<p>

<center>(E)</center><p>

<i>What is the fourth sin that is opposed to justice in the act of judgment?</i><p>

It is the sin of the witness who is wanting in his duty
(LXX.).<p>

<i>How may a witness be wanting in his duty?</i><p>

He may be wanting in his duty either by abstaining
from giving evidence when he is required to do so by the
public authority, which he is bound to obey in things
that belong to justice; or whenever his evidence may
prevent loss to someone; or by adducing false testimony
(LXX. 1, 4).<p>

Is false testimony always a mortal sin? Yes, it is always a mortal sin, if not always on account <!--156 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA" --> of the lie, which may be venial, it always is mortal by reason of perjury, and also by reason of injustice if one give such testimony against a just cause (CXX. 4). <p>

<center>(F)</center><p>

<i>What is the last sin against justice in the act of judgment?</i><p>

It is the sin of the advocate who refuses to defend a
just cause such as can be defended by him only; or who
defends an unjust cause particularly in civil causes; or
who demands an exorbitant sum for his fee (LXXI. 1,3,4).<p>

<hr><p>
XXIV. OF THE SINS OF SPEECH COMMITTED IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF LIFE,
VIZ., OF INVECTIVE, OF DETRACTION (AND CALUMNY), OF WHISPERINGS, OF
MOCKERY, OF THE CURSE<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>What are the sins of injustice committed against our neighbour by speech in the ordinary course of life?</i><p>

They are invective, detraction, whisperings, mockery,
and the curse (LXXII.-LXXVI.).<p>

<i>What is understood by invective?</i><p>

Invective is that sin which wounds another, in the
honour or in the respect due to him, by words (LXXII. 1).<p>

<i>Is it a mortal sin?</i><p>

Yes, whenever such words attack the honour of another
in a grave way. The sin is venial only if our neighbour's
honour is not seriously injured, or if one has no intention
of seriously injuring another (LXXII. 2).<p>

<i>Is one bound in justice to treat others with the reverence due to them?</i><p>

Yes, one is strictly bound in justice to do this, for the
harmony of all living in a society is dependent upon
this (LXXII. 1-3).
<!--
OF JUSTICE 157
--><p>

<i>Upon what is this duty founded and what is its importance?</i><p>

It is founded upon this, that the honour of each one
is a thing which men cherish most. Even the least
among men has a right to be treated with the respect due
to his own particular status in life: to be lacking towards
him in respect, whether by word or deed, is to wound
him in what he holds most dear (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>One ought then with the greatest care to avoid saying or doing anything whatsoever which may bring disconsolation or humiliation upon our fellow-men?</i><p>

Yes, one must do this at all cost (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>Is it ever permitted to act otherwise?</i><p>

This is only permitted in the case of a superior whose
duty it may be to correct one under his charge when the
latter merits such correction; with this condition, however,
that a superior do not do this in the heat of passion, or in
a manner that is indiscreet or uncalled for (LXXII. 2, <i>Obj.</i> 2).<p>

<i>What should be done with regard to those who are lacking in respect?</i><p>

With such as these charity, and sometimes justice,
demands that their boldness be punished. But in this
case it is necessary to be on one's guard lest, in punishing
them, one exceed the right bounds imposed by the law
and so bring injury to oneself (LXXII. 3).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What is understood by detraction?</i><p>

Detraction, in its strict sense, implies the intention of
attacking the reputation of our neighbour, or of taking
away wholly or in part the esteem in which he is held by
others, whensoever there is no just cause for so doing
(LXXIII. 1)<p>

<i>Is this a great sin?</i><p>

Yes, since it is to take away unjustly from our neighbour
a good that is more precious than riches which are taken
from him by theft (LXXIII. 2, 3).
<!--
158 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA" 
--><p>

<i>In how many ways may one commit the sin of detraction?</i><p>

In four ways: in imputing to our neighbour things that
are false or in exaggerating his defects; or in making
known things unknown about him and which prejudice
him in the eyes of others; or in attributing to him 
intentions that are of a doubtful and perhaps of an evil
character, whereby all that he does with the best intention
becomes vitiated (LXXIII. 1, <i>Obj.</i> 3).<p>

<i>Is there any other sin of detraction that is hurtful to our neighbour?</i><p>

Yes, in an indirect way, by refusing to acknowledge the
good in him, or by keeping silence maliciously concerning
his good points, or by lessening their worth (LXXIII. 1,
Obj.3).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>What is the sin called whispering?</i><p>

It is that sin which attacks our neighbour by seeking
directly through dishonest and insidious speech, to sow
discord and create misunderstanding between those who
are united by the bonds of friendship (LXXIV. 1).<p>

<i>Is this a grave sin?</i><p>

This is a most odious sin against our neighbour, and
merits perhaps more than other sins that can be committed
against our neighbour the just reproval both of God and
men (LXXIV. 2).<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>What is mockery?</i><p>

Mockery is a sin of the tongue against justice which
consists in reviling our neighbour by bringing to his
notice his defects and shortcomings, which fact makes him
lose confidence in himself as regards his relations with
others (LXXV. 1).<p>

<i>Is this a grave sin?</i><p>

Yes, of a truth, for it implies contempt for the person
of our neighbour; and this is a most detestable thing
and well merits chastisement (LXXV. 2).<p>

<i>Is irony also a kind of mockery and is it also a grave sin?</i><p>

Irony may be only slightly culpable if it touch only the
<!--
OF JUSTICE 159
-->
small faults or defects of our neighbour, and it may exist
without contempt for our neighbour's person. Sometimes 
irony may be no sin at all, whenever, for instance,
one taunts another for the sake of innocent amusement
and no risk be run of bringing depression or humiliation
upon him who is the object. This manner of amusement 
is, however, of a delicate nature and should be used
with much prudence (LXXV. 1, <i>Obj.</i> 1).<p>

<i>May not irony sometimes be an act of virtue?</i><p>

Yes, if one employ it as it behoves, by way of correction. 
A superior may advantageously correct an inferior
in this manner, or even those on an equal footing may
employ it with advantage and with charity by way of
fraternal correction.<p>

<i>In such case what does the use of irony demand?</i><p>

It demands that it be used with great discretion. For
if it is good for those who have too good an opinion of
themselves to be brought to acknowledge in a truer
measure their proper worth, one has to take care lest,
by exceeding the bounds of irony, a person become so
depressed as wholly to lose confidence in himself; and
without this praiseworthy self-confidence all spontaneity
of action would be paralyzed.<p>

<center>(E)</center><p>

<i>What relation is there between the sin called the curse, and the four sins of invective, detraction, whispering, and mockery?</i><p>

All these sins have in common this, that they are sins of
the tongue which attack the good of our neighbour; but
whereas the four latter do this by the words of a proposition 
which formulate evil, or deny the good of our
neighbour, the curse attacks our neighbour's good by
wishing him evil (LXXVI. 1, 4)<p>

<i>Is the curse then essentially bad?</i><p>

Yes, whenever one wishes evil to another for evil's
sake; and such a wish is, of itself, always a grave sin
(LXXVI. 3).
