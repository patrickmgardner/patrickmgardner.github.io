BRIEF OF<br>
HIS HOLINESS POPE BENEDICT XV.<p align="center">

<i>To our well-beloved son Thomas P&egrave;gues of the Order of Friars 
Preachers.</i><p>

BELOVED SON,<p align="center">

Greeting and Apostolic Benediction.<p>

The manifold honours paid by the Holy See to St. Thomas Aquinas exclude 
for ever any doubt from the mind of Catholics with regard to his being 
raised up by God as the Master of Doctrine to be followed by the Church 
through all ages.  It was therefore fitting that the singular wisdom of 
the Holy Doctor should be made accessible not only to the clergy but to 
the faithful in general, and to whomsoever desired to make a deeper 
study of the things of religion; for in very truth, the nearer one 
approaches to the light, so much the more is one enlightened.<p>

Much praise is therefore due to you first of all because you have 
undertaken to write a commentary in your mother tongue [French] upon 
the greatest work of the Angelic Doctor, viz., the <i>Summa 
Theologica</i> (the volumes already published of this work show what 
success has attended your labours); and, secondly, because you have 
recently published the <i>Summa Theologica</i> in the form of a 
catechism.  Therein you have aptly accomodated the riches of the great 
genius to the understanding of the less instructed
<!--
vi BRIEF OF HIS HOLINESS POPE BENEDICT XV.
-->
as well as of the learned; briefly and succinctly you have expounded 
the doctrine, and in the same luminous order as that of the Angelic 
Doctor whose treatise is more lengthy and more detailed.<p>

We congratulate you sincerely on this fruit of your labours which shows 
your masterly knowledge of St. Thomas' doctrine.  We hope, therefore, 
through your love of Holy Church that this work will bring many souls 
to a sound knowledge of Christian doctrine.<p>

As a mark of the divine largess and in testimony of our own special 
good will we impart in all affection to you and to your pupils the 
Apostolic Benediction.<p>

Given at Rome at St. Peter's the fifth day of February, 1919, in the 
fifth year of our Pontificate,<p align="center">

FOREWORD<p>

The author of the original work asked me personally to translate his 
book into English.  I have done so; but the genius of the English 
language did not permit a literal translation.  The present book is 
therefore in some sense rather an adaptation than a literal 
translation, although the latter has been strictly adhered to wherever 
possible.<p>

In the original work the answer always repeats the whole question word 
for word; in the cause of brevity and sometimes for clearness' sake, I 
have adopted the simple answer of "yes" or "no" lest the reader tire 
with the insistency of the ceaseless repetition.<p>

Those readers who wish to study the doctrine more deeply will find much 
help in the references quoted at the end of most of the answers to the 
questions; they refer to the <i>Summa Theologica</i> itself, which has 
been translated literally into English [To be had of Burns, Oates and 
Washbourne] by the Dominican Fathers of the English Province.  To take 
an example: On p. 9 of this book there is the question: <i>Does the 
Providence of God extend also to inanimate things?</i> And the answer: 
<i>Yes, for they are a part of God's handiwork</i> (XXII. 2, <i>Obj.</i> 
5).  The reference here quoted means that the doctrine in its every 
detail is to be found in the reply to the 5th Objection of the 2nd 
Article of the 22nd Question of the First Part of the <i>Summa</i>.  It 
should be noted that the citation of "First Part" is not added to the 
quotation for the simple reason that the particular "part" of the 
<i>Summa</i> to which the quotation refers may easily be found by 
consulting the table of Contents.  Moreover, whenever necessary and in 
order to give additional strength to the doctrines of St. Thomas, 
reference has been made to the new Code of Canon Law; <i>e.g.,</i> on 
p. 289 (<i>Code,</i> Canon 1036).  Thus this work is brought up to 
date.<p align="center">
