<h4>FIRST SECTION<br>
GENERAL OUTLINE OF MAN'S RETURN TO GOD</h4>
</center>
<hr><p>
I. OF MAN'S RESEMBLANCE TO GOD IN THE FREE 
ADMINISTRATION OF ALL THAT CONCERNS HIM <p>

<i>Has man any special likeness to God in his actions?</i><p>

Yes, man in his actions has a special likeness to God.<p>

<i>In what consists this special likeness of man to God?</i><p>

It consists in this, that just as God disposes of all the
universe which depends upon Him, at His will and in all
liberty, so in the same way man disposes at his will and
in all liberty of all things that depend upon him 
(Prologue).<p>

<hr><p>
II. OF THE LAST END OR HAPPINESS OF 
MAN VIEWED IN ALL HIS ACTIONS<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Has man always an end in view when he acts?</i><p>

Yes, man has always an end in view when he acts,
that is when he acts as man and not as a machine, or by
impulse, or by any reaction which is purely physical
or instinctive (I. 1).<p>

<i>In the material world, is it only man that can act for an end?</i><p>

Yes, only man in the material world can act for an end.<p>

<i>Does it then follow that all other beings in the material world act without an end?</i><p>

No, it does not follow that all other beings in the
material world act without an end; on the contrary, all
<!--
56 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
beings act for an end that is very definite; but they are
incapable of fixing an end for themselves; it is God who
knows the end and who fixes it for them (I. 2).<p>

<i>All other beings then act in view of attaining some end which has been fixed for them by God?</i><p>

Yes, all other beings act in view of attaining some end
which has been fixed for them by God (I. 2).<p>

<i>Has not God also fixed for man the end for which he acts?</i><p>

Yes.<p>

<i>What then is the difference between man when he acts and other creatures in the material world?</i><p>

The difference is this, that man under the higher action
of God and dependently upon this action, can fix for
himself the end for which he acts; whereas other creatures
of the material world put into execution blindly, naturally,
or instinctively the end fixed to their action by God (I. 2).<p>

<i>What is the reason of this difference between man and other beings in the matter of actions?</i><p>

The reason is because man is endowed with
mind, whereas other creatures are not (I. 2).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>Is there some supreme object or some last end which man has in view whenever he acts?</i><p>

Yes, there is always some supreme object or some last
end man has in view whenever he acts; since without
some such supreme object or last end he would be unable
to will anything at all (I. 4, 5).<p>

<i>Does man in his actions ordain all to this supreme or last end which he has in view whenever he acts?</i><p>

Yes, man ordains all to this supreme object or last end
whenever he acts; if he does not do this consciously and
explicitly, he does it at least implicitly and by a sort of
natural instinct in the order of reason (I. 6).<p>

<i>What is the last end or what is the supreme object which man always has in view and to which he ordains all ever he acts?</i><p>

This last end or supreme object which man always has
<!--
OF THE END OF MAN 57
-->
in view when he acts and to which he ordains all is
happiness (I. 7).<p>

<i>Man then necessarily desires to be happy?</i><p>

Yes, of necessity man desires to be happy.<p>

<i>Is it absolutely impossible to find a man who desires to be unhappy?</i><p>

Yes, it is quite impossible to find a man who desires
to be unhappy (V. 8).<p>

<i>Can man deceive himself as to the object of his happiness?</i><p>

Yes, man can thus deceive himself, because since he
can seek his welfare among so many and divers good
things, he can deceive himself as to the object of his true
happiness (I. 7).<p>

<i>What happens if man deceives himself as to the object of his true happiness?</i><p>

If man deceives himself as to the object of his true
happiness, it follows that instead of finding happiness at
the end of his life, he finds nought but the worst evil.<p>

<i>It is then supremely important for man not to deceive himself as to the object of his happiness?</i><p>

There is nothing of greater import for man than that
he deceive not himself as to the object of his happiness.<p>

<hr><p>
III. OF THE OBJECT OF THIS HAPPINESS<p>

<i>What is the object of the happiness of man?</i><p>

The object of the happiness of man is a good higher
than himself and in which he can find his perfection
(II. 1-8).<p>

<i>Are riches the object of this happiness of man?</i><p>

No, it is not riches, for these are beneath man; nor are
they sufficient to guarantee his entire welfare and his
perrfection (II. i).<p>

<i>Are honours?</i><p>

No, not honours; because honours do not bring perfection,
but rather presuppose it, that is when they are not
false honours; and if they be false they avail nothing
(II. 2).
<!--
58 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA I
--><p>

<i>Is it glory or renown?</i><p>

No, for these are of no worth unless they be merited;
moreover among men these things are often foolish and
ill-judged (II. 3).<p>

<i>Is it power?</i><p>

No, because power is for the good of others, and is
subject to their whims and disobedience (II. 4).<p>

<i>Is it health or bodily beauty?</i><p>

No, because these good things are too unstable;
furthermore they belong only to the external perfection
of man and not to his internal perfection or that of his
soul (II. 5).<p>

<i>Does it consist in pleasures of the body?</i><p>

No, it does not consist in pleasures of the body, since
these are of small account in comparison with the higher
pleasures of the mind which are proper to the soul (II. 6).<p>

<i>Does the happiness of man consist in something which is a good of the soul?</i><p>

Yes, the happiness of man consists in some good of
soul (II. 7).<p>

<i>What is this good of the soul in which the happiness of man consists?</i><p>

The good of the soul in which the happiness of man
consists is God, the Supreme Good, Sovereign and
Infinite (II. 8).<p>

<hr><p>
IV. OF THE POSSESSION OF THIS HAPPINESS<p>

<i>How can man come to possess God, his Supreme Good, and to enjoy Him?</i><p>

Man can come to possess God, his Supreme Good,
and to enjoy Him, by an act of his intellect which is moved
to this by his will.<p>

<i>What must man do in order to attain his perfect happiness by this act of his intellect?</i><p>

In order for man to attain to his perfect happiness
this act of his intellect, it is necessary that God should be
<!--
OF HUMAN ACTS 59
-->
reached by him, as He is in Himself, and not merely in
the way He can be reached by the aid of creatures whatsoever 
these creatures may be (III. 5-8).<p>

<i>What is this act called whereby God is reached by the intellect as He is in Himself?</i><p>

This act is called the "vision of God" (III. 8).<p>

<i>Does then the perfect happiness of man consist in the vision of God?</i><p>

Yes, it is in the vision of God that the perfect happiness
man consists (III. 8).<p>

<i>When man has attained to this vision of God in all its perfection, does it bring with it whatsoever is of perfection to man, in his soul, body, and in everything that concerns him?</i><p>

Yes, when man has attained to this vision of God in
all its perfection of necessity it brings with it all that can
be of perfection to man in his soul, body, and in all that
concerns him; for since it is the good of man in its highest
source, from it come all things felicitous for his supreme
perfection (IV. 1-8).<p>

<i>This vision then means for man the possession of all good to the exclusion of all evil?</i><p>

Yes, this means for man the possession of all good to
the exclusion of all evil (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<hr><p>
V. OF THE MEANS OF REALIZING THIS POSSESSION, OR OF THE GOOD ACTS
WHICH ARE DESERVING OF IT, AND OF EVIL ACTS WHICH BRING ABOUT ITS LOSS<p>

<i>Can man on earth and in this life come to possess this perfect happiness which is the vision of God?</i><p>

No, on earth and in this life it is impossible for man to
come to possess the vision of God which is his perfect
happiness, for the conditions of this life and the miseries
therereof are incompatible with such fullness of happiness
(V. 3).
<!--
60 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>How can man attain to the vision of God which constitutes his perfect happiness?</i><p>

Man can only attain to the vision of God which 
constitutes his perfect happiness by the help of God from
whom he receives it (V. 5).<p>

<i>Does God confer this boon upon man if man do not by merit prepare himself thereto?</i><p>

No, God will not confer this boon upon man unless
by merit he make himself worthy to receive it (V. 7).<p>

What then has man to do on earth and in this life?</i><p>

On earth and in this life man has only to prepare himself 
by way of merit to receive from God some day the
beatific vision and all that it entails; and this shall come
about when God gives to man his reward.<p>

<hr><p>
VI. OF WHAT IS IMPLIED IN A HUMAN ACT FOR IT TO BE A GOOD MERITORIOUS ACT,
OR A BAD DEMERITORIOUS ACT; AND OF MERIT AND DEMERIT IN GENERAL<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Is it possible to say by what means man on earth and in this life can prepare himself, by way of merit, to receive from God some day in token of reward the beatific vision in which consists man's eternal happiness?</i><p>

Yes, this he can merit solely by his acts (VI., Prologue).<p>

<i>Of what kind of acts is there question?</i><p>

Of virtuous acts.<p>

<i>What is meant by "acts of virtue"?</i><p>

They are those "acts which man performs by his own
free will in conformity with God's will under the action
of grace" (VI.-CXIV.).<p>

<i>What is necessary that man's acts should proceed from his will?</i><p>

It is necessary that he perform them spontaneously
and with the knowledge that he is their cause (VI. 1-8).
<!--
OF HUMAN ACTS 61
--><p>

<i>What is meant by saying that he must perform them spontaneously?</i><p>

It is meant that he must perform them without 
constraint or force (VI. 4, 5, 6).<p>

<i>How can man be coerced or forced to do something against his will?</i><p>

Man can be coerced or forced to do something against
his will in two ways: by violence and by fear (VI. 4, 5, 6).<p>

<i>What is understood by violence?</i><p>

By violence is understood a force exterior to man
which fetters his members and impedes him from acting
as he wills, or makes him do exteriorly what his will
rejects (VI. 4, 5).<p>

<i>What is understood by fear?</i><p>

By fear is understood an interior movement which
makes man will a thing he would not otherwise will,
but to which he consents in the present circumstances
in order to avoid some evil that threatens (VI. 6).<p>

<i>Is that which one does under violence wholly involuntary?</i><p>

Yes, that which one does under exterior violence is
wholly involuntary (VI. 5).<p>

<i>Why under "exterior" violence?</i><p>

Because sometimes the word "violence" is taken to
signify the internal movement of anger.<p>

<i>In this case and in the case of other interior movements which excite or incline the will may one also speak of involuntariness?</i><p>

No, in these divers cases one may not speak of 
involuntariness unless perchance these interior movements
be so vehement as to deprive man of the use of his
reason (VI. 7).<p>

<i>And when one acts through fear, is the act also involuntary?</i><p>

When one acts through fear the act is voluntary, but
with it there is an admixture of involuntary in this
sense, that that which is done is indeed willed, but it is
willed with reluctancy and by reason of some evil from
which man shrinks (VI. 6).
<!--
62 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>It has also been said that for man's acts to be voluntary they must be done with knowledge of what is being done?</i><p>

Yes; and this means that if one performs an act, with
out the knowledge of what one is really doing, the act
done is not voluntary (VI. 8).<p>

<i>Is such an act then involuntary?</i><p>

Yes, provided that if one knew the true facts, one
would not have performed the act (VI. 8).<p>

<i>Can that which one does or which one does not owing to ignorance or to some error, be nevertheless sometimes voluntary?</i><p>

Yes; it is always so if one is responsible for one's 
ignorance or one's error (VI. 8).<p>

<i>And when is one responsible for one's ignorance or one error?</i><p>

When one wills these directly, or when they are the
outcome of culpable negligence (VI. 8).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Must not one take into account the circumstances which accompany a human act, since upon them depends so much the character of the act?</i><p>

Yes; and nothing is more important than the weighing 
of the circumstances of a human act in order to appreciate 
its true value (VII. 1, 2).<p>

<i>Is it possible to enumerate these circumstances?</i><p>

Yes, these circumstances are those of person, of
object, or of effect produced, of place, of motive, of the
means employed, and of time (VII. 3).<p>

<i>What is meant by these different circumstances?</i><p>

These different circumstances bear on the character
or condition of the person who acts, on what he does,
or on what results from his act, on the place where he does 
the act, on the end for which he acts, on those things
which he uses as means, and on the time when he acts
(VII. 3).
<!--
OF HUMAN ACTS 63
--><p>

<i>Which is the most important of these circumstances?</i><p>

It is the motive for which a person acts or the end
which he has in view when he acts (VII. 4).<p>

<i>Is it always the will which produces human acts?</i><p>

Yes, it is always the will; sometimes the will only;
at other times it is some other faculty or even the 
exterior members of the body, but always under the impulse
and by order of the will (VIII.-XVII.).<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>The will of man then is the central point of all those acts that constitute his life as a rational being, and have direct bearing upon the reward of his life which is the winning or the losing of the happiness of heaven?</i><p>

Yes, the will of man is the central point of all those
acts that constitute his life as a rational being, and have
direct bearing upon the reward of his life which is the
gain or the loss of the happiness of heaven; and this
implies that the act of a human being is of no account
except in so far as it proceeds from the will; whether
it be the will itself that produces the act, or whether the
will move some other faculty of the soul or even member
of the body to produce the act (VIII.-XXI.).<p>

<i>Of all the interior acts of the will which is the most important and the one which is the root of responsibility in man?</i><p>

It is the act of choosing or "choice" (XIII. 1-6).<p>

<i>Why has the act of choosing or "choice" this importance?</i><p>

It is because this act effects that the will fixes with full
knowledge and after deliberation upon some determined
good, which it accepts and makes its own in preference
to any other (XIII. 1).<p>

<i>Is choice properly speaking the act of the free will?</i><p>

Yes (XIII. 6).<p>

<i>It is then by the choice that he makes with regard to all things that man derives his true moral character and his real value in view of the gain or the loss of his eternal happiness?</i><p>

Yes, it is by the choice that he makes in regard to all
<!--
64 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
things that man derives his true moral character and his
real value in view of the gain or the loss of his eternal
happiness.<p>

<i>How is choice divided as regards man's true character and moral worth in view of the gain or loss of his eternal happiness?</i><p>

It is divided into "good choice" and "bad choice"
(XVIII.-XXI.).<p>

<i>What is a "good choice"?</i><p>

It is one that bears upon a good object, in view of some
good end, and as regards which all the accompanying.
circumstances are good (XVIII.-XIX.).<p>

<center>(E)</center><p>

<i>Whence is derived the goodness of an object, of an end, and of the circumstances?</i><p>

This goodness is derived from the relation that all
these things have with right reason (XIX. 3-6).<p>

<i>What is meant by right reason?</i><p>

By this is understood the reason enlightened by all
the lights that come from God, or which at least is not
knowingly at variance with them.<p>

<i>When man then wills or chooses something in conformity with right reason for an object or an end of which right reason approves, and of which all the accompanying circumstances accord with right reason, the act willed or chosen man is a good act?</i><p>

Yes; then, and then only, is man's act a good act.
on any one of these counts whatsoever man's act is
conformed with right reason it ceases to be a good
and it becomes in a less or great degree, as the case
be, a bad act (XVIII.-XXI.).<p>

<i>What is a bad act called?</i><p>

A bad act is called a "fault" or a "sin" (XXI. 1).
<!--
OF THE PASSIONS 65
--><p>

<hr><p>
VII. OF THE AFFECTIVE MOVEMENTS IN
MAN WHICH ARE CALLED THE PASSIONS<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Are there not in man certain other affective acts which can contribute towards the reward of his life, other than the acts of his will?</i><p>

Yes, there are other affective acts in man.<p>

<i>What are they called?</i><p>

They are called the "passions" (XXII.-XLVIII.).<p>

<i>What is understood by the passions?</i><p>

By passions are understood affective movements of the
sensitive part of man's soul.<p>

<i>Is it only man that has these affective movements in the sensitive part of his soul?</i><p>

No, these affective movements of the sensitive part are
to be found in all animals (XXII. 1, 2, 3).<p>

<i>Have these affective movements of the sensitive part in animals any moral worth?</i><p>

No, these affective movements of the sensitive part in
animals have no moral value; only in man have they a
moral value.<p>

<i>Why is it that only in man these affective movements of the sensitive part are of moral value?</i><p>

Because it is in man only that they are related with the
higher acts of the free will in that they are subject to their
rule (XXV. or XXIV. 1-4).<p>

<i>What precisely are these affective movements of the sensitive part in man and to which is given the name of passions?</i><p>

These affective movements of the sensitive part in
man and to which is given the name of passions, are
movements of the heart which bear towards a good
or withdraw from an evil tendered by the senses (XXIII.,
XXIV., or XXV.).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

How many kinds are there of these movements of the heart? There are eleven (XXII. 4). <!--66 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA --> <p>

<i>What are they called?</i><p>

Their names are: "love," "desire," "delight" or
"joy"; "hate," "abhorence," "sadness," "hope,"
"courage," "fear," "despair," and "anger" (XXII. 4).<p>

<i>Do these movements of the heart occupy an important part in man's life?</i><p>

Yes, these movements of the heart occupy a very
important part in man's life.<p>

<i>Why is it that they occupy a very important part in man's life?</i><p>

Because in man there is a twofold nature: rational and
sensitive; the sensitive nature is the one that is moved
first by the action of the external world in the midst of
which we live and from which we derive even all the
data of our rational life.<p>

<i>Are not then the movements of the heart or the passions always, of themselves, bad?</i><p>

No, the movements of the heart or the passions are not
of themselves always bad.<p>

<i>When are these movements of the heart or the passions bad?</i><p>

When they are not in accord with the rulings of right
reason.<p>

<i>And when are they not in accord with the rulings of right reason?</i><p>

When they bear towards a sensible good or withdraw
from a sensible evil by forestalling the judgment of the 
reason or by coming into play contrary to this judgment.
(XXV. or XXIV. 3).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Is it only in the sensitive part of man that there are movements of love, desire, delight, hate, aversion, sadness, hope, daring, fear, despair, and anger?</i><p>

These same movements are to be found also in the will.<p>

<i>What difference is there between these movements in so far as they are in the sensitive part, and in so far as they are in the will?</i><p>

There is this difference, that in the sensitive part they
<!--
OF THE PASSIONS 67
-->
always imply the co-operation of the organism or of the
body, whereas in the will they are purely spiritual
(XXXI. 4).<p>

<i>When one speaks of movements of the heart, of which affective movements is there question, of those of the sensitive part or of those of the will?</i><p>

Properly speaking, there is question of the movements
of the sensitive part; but in a metaphorical sense there
is a question also of those of the will.<p>

<i>When then one speaks of the heart of man, can there be question of this twofold sort of movement?</i><p>

Yes, when one speaks of the heart of man, there can
be question of this twofold kind of movement.<p>

<i>And when it is said of a man that he has heart, what is meant by that?</i><p>

When it is said of a man that he has heart, one means
to imply that at times he is affectionate and 
tender-hearted, of whatever kind of affection there may be
question, whether of the purely sensitive or of the
spiritual order, and at other times one means to imply
that he is courageous and virile.<p>

<i>Why is it sometimes said and what is meant by saying that one must watch over one's heart?</i><p>

When it is said that one must watch over one's heart,
one means that it is necessary to take care lest one follow
indiscreetly the first affective movements, especially of
the sensitive order, which tend to make us seek what is
pleasing and to shrink from what is displeasing.<p>

<i>One speaks sometimes of the training of the heart; what does this mean?</i><p>

This means that one must endeavour to have only
good affective movements.<p>

<i>This education of the heart, thus understood, is it of any importance?</i><p>

Yes, for this education of the heart, thus understood,
embraces the whole of man's activity in the acquisition
of virtue and the shunning of vice.

VIII. OF THE VIRTUES WHICH CAN AND
OUGHT TO BE THE PRINCIPLE OF MAN'S GOOD ACTS<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>What is meant by the acquiring of virtue?</i><p>

By this is meant the acquiring or the bringing to 
perfection of all the "good habits which make man act well"
(XLIX.-LXVIII.).<p>

<i>What are the good habits which make man act well?</i><p>

They are dispositions or inclinations which are seated
in divers faculties, and which render good the acts of 
these faculties (LV. 1.4).<p>

<i>Whence in man's divers faculties come these dispositions or inclinations which are conducive to their acting well?</i><p>

At times they come, in part, from nature herself;
sometimes they come from the person who acts for
virtue's sake; and sometimes they come directly from
God, who produces them in the soul supernaturally
(LXIII. 1-4).<p>

<i>Are there any such dispositions or good habits or in man's intellect?</i><p>

Yes, there are suchlike dispositions or good habits
or virtues in man's intellect (LVI. 3).<p>

<i>What is the effect of these virtues in man's intellect?</i><p>

They make man's intellect to seek the truth only (LVI. 3)<p>

<i>What are these virtues in man s intellect called?</i><p>

They are called "intuition" or "insight," "science,"
"wisdom," "art," and "prudence" (LVII. 1-6).<p>

<i>What is the object of each of these virtues in man's intellect or reason?</i><p>

Intuition or insight gives a knowledge of principles 
(self-evident truths); science a knowledge of conclusions;
wisdom a knowledge of the highest causes; art gives
directions for the execution of external works; and 
prudence directions for the whole of the moral life 
(LVII. 1-6).
<!--
OF HABITS: VIRTUES 69
<!--<p>

<i>Prudence then is most important in the exercise of a virtuous life?</i><p>

Yes, prudence is most important in the exercise of a
virtuous life (LVII. 5).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Are these the only virtues in man s intellect?</i><p>

There is another virtue in man's intellect but it is
of an altogether higher order (LXII. 1-4).<p>

<i>What is this virtue in man's intellect of an altogether higher order?</i><p>

It is the virtue of "faith" (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>Are there also virtues of the same order in the will?</i><p>

Yes (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>What are these virtues of the sdme order in the will called?</i><p>

They are called " Hope" and " Charity" (<i>ibid.</i>) .<p>

<i>Have these virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity any special name?</i><p>

Yes, they are called the "theological virtues" (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>What is understood by the words theological virtues?</i><p>

By these words is meant that the virtues of Faith, Hope,
Charity have reference to God alone, and that they
have also their sole source in God (LXII. 1).<p>

<i>Is there any other virtue in the will?</i><p>

Yes, there is also the virtue of "justice" in the will;
the other virtues which spring from justice (LVI. 6;
<hr><p>
LIX. 4; LX. 2, 3).<p>

<i>Are there to be found virtues in the other faculties of man?</i><p>

Yes, there are virtues which reside in the affective
sensitive faculties of man.<p>

<center>(E)</center><p>

<i>What are the virtues to be found in the affective sensitive faculties?</i><p>

They are the virtues of "fortitude" and "temperance," 
and the other virtues which arise from them.
<!--

--><p>

<i>What are the virtues of justice, fortitude, temperance, and prudence called?</i><p>

They are called the moral virtues (LVI-II. 1).<p>

<i>Are they not also called by the name of the "cardinal" virtues?</i><p>

Yes, they are also called the cardinal virtues (LXI. 1-4).<p>

<i>What is meant by the words cardinal virtues?</i><p>

By these words is implied that they are virtues of
particular importance, which are as it were the hinges
(in Latin <i>cardo, cardinis</i>) upon which, setting aside the
theological virtues, turn all the other virtues (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>In man must the virtues of the natural order, or the acquired virtues, intellectual or moral, have corresponding virtues of the supernatural order, infused by God in order that man may be pelfected in every act of his moral life?</i><p>

Yes; for only these infused virtues are proportionate
to those acts in the supernatural moral life of man which
the supernatural end demands; an end held out for man's 
attainment by the theological virtues (LXIII. 3, 4).<p>

<center>(F)</center><p>

<i>Are all these virtues, theological and cardinal, necessary in order that man may live well?</i><p>

Yes, all these virtues are necessary that man may live
well (LXV. 1-5).<p>

<i>And suppose man is lacking in any one of these virtues, could he not be called virtuous?</i><p>

No; for if man is found wanting in any one of these
virtues, whatsoever other virtues he may have they
would never, in him, possess the true character or nature
of perfect virtue (LXV. 4).<p>

<hr><p>
IX. OF THE GIFTS WHICH CROWN AND PERFECT THE VIRTUES<p>

<i>Does it suffice for man to possess all the virtues spoken of above in order for his life to be what it ought to be in view of gaining heaven?</i><p>

No; he must also have the gifts of the Holy Ghost
(LXVIII. 2).
<!--
OF HABITS: VIRTUES 71
--><p>

<i>What is understood by the gifts of the Holy Ghost?</i><p>

By these are understood habitual dispositions which are
given to man by the Holy Ghost, and which make man
yielding and docile to all the inspirations of the Holy
Spirit that help man towards the possession of God in
heaven (LXVIII. 1, 2, 3).<p>

<i>Why are these gifts of the Holy Ghost necessary in addition to all the virtues above mentioned?</i><p>

Because man called to live as a child of God, is unable
to attain to the perfection of this life unless God Himself, 
by His own action, makes perfect what man's action
could achieve only incompletely through the virtues
(LXVIII. a).<p>

<i>How many gifts of the Holy Ghost are there?</i><p>

There are seven gifts of the Holy Ghost (LXVIII. 4).<p>

<i>What are the seven gifts of the Holy Ghost?</i><p>

They are the gifts of "wisdom," "understanding,"
"knowledge," "counsel," "piety," "fortitude," and
"fear of the Lord" (LXVIII. 4).<p>

X. OF THE BEATITUDES AND OF THE FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, WHICH ARE
EFFECTS OF THE VIRTUES AND THE GIFTS<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>When man is thus endowed with the virtues and the gifts, has he, on his part, all that is required to live a perfect life in view of winning heaven?</i><p>

Yes, when man is thus endowed with the virtues and
the gifts he has, on his part, all that is required to live a
perfect life in view of winning heaven.<p>

<i>May not one even say that he has already, in some sort, begun to live the life of heaven here on earth?</i><p>

Yes, one may even say that he has already, in some
sort, begun to live the life of heaven here on earth; and
with this in mind one speaks of the beatitudes on earth,
and of the fruit of the Holy Spirit (LXIX., LXX.).
<!--
72 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>What is understood by the beatitudes?</i><p>

By the beatitudes is meant the acts of the virtues and
the gifts enumerated by our Lord Jesus Christ in the
gospel, which by their presence in the soul or by the
merits which result there, give to us as it were a guarantee
of the future beatitude promised to each of them
(LXIX. 1).<p>

<i>And what is meant by the fruit of the Holy Spirit?</i><p>

By the fruit of the Holy Spirit is understood those good
acts whose nature it is to give joy to the virtuous man in
that he acts in the supernatural order under the impulse
of the Holy Spirit (LXX. 1).<p>

<i>Is this fruit distinct from the beatitudes?</i><p>

If the fruit is all that is most perfect in the absolute
sense of the word, for man it is identified with the fruit
<i>par excellence</i> which is the beatitude of heaven. It is
also identified with the beatitudes in this life; but it is
distinct from them in this sense, that without needing the
essential perfection or excellence of the beatitudes, its
nature of goodness is sufficient (LXX. 2).<p>

<i>What are the beatitudes and what are their rewards?</i><p>

They are: "Blessed are the poor in spirit, because
theirs is the kingdom of heaven";" Blessed are the meek,
because they shall possess the land"; "Blessed are they
who weep, because they shall be comforted"; "Blessed
are they who thirst and hunger for justice sake, because
they shall be filled"; "Blessed are the merciful, because
they shall obtain mercy"; "Blessed are the pure of heart,
for they shall see God "; "Blessed are the peaceful,
because they shall be called the children of God"
(LXIX. 2-4).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>What is the fruit of the Holy Ghost?</i><p>

The fruit of the Holy Ghost is: "charity,"
"peace," "patience," "benignity," "meekness,"
<!--
OF HABITS: VICES 73
-->
"faithfulness," "modesty," "continency," and 
"chastity" (LXX. 3).<p>

<i>Where is the fruit of the Holy Ghost spoken of?</i><p>

It is to be found in the Epistle of St. Paul to the
Galatians (v. 22, 23).<p>

<i>And where are the beatitudes enumerated?</i><p>

They are enumerated in the Gospel of St. Matthew
(v. 3-10), and in a manner less complete, in St. Luke
(vi. 20-22).<p>

<i>Is there not also an eighth beatitude in St. Matthew, to be found also in St. Luke?</i><p>

Yes, it is the beatitude of those who suffer persecution
for justice sake; but it is included in the other seven
beatitudes of which it is, as it were, the r&eacute;sum&eacute; 
or the consequence (LXIX. 3, <i>Obj.</i> 5).<p>

<i>There can then be nothing better for man on earth than to live thus the life of the virtues and of the gifts, from which spring the beatitudes and the fruit of the Holy Ghost?</i><p>

No, there can be nothing better for man on earth than
to live thus the life of the virtues and of the gifts, from
which spring the beatitudes and the fruit of the Holy
Ghost.<p>

<hr><p>
XI. OF VICES WHICH ARE THE PRINCIPLE OF MAN'S BAD ACTIONS<p>

<i>Is there another life man can lead on earth other than a virtuous life?</i><p>

Yes, it is the life of sin or vice (LXXI.-LXXXIX.).<p>

<i>What is understood by vice?</i><p>

By vice is understood the state of man who lives in sin
(LXXI. 1-6).<p>

<i>What is sin?</i><p>

Sin is an act or a voluntary omission which is bad.<p>

<i>When is an act or a voluntary omission bad?</i><p>

When this act is contrary to the good of God, or of our
neighbour, or of man himself (LXXII. 4).
<!--
74 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>How comes it that man can thus wish a thing which is opposed to the good of God, to the good of his neighbour, or to his own good?</i><p>

It is because man can will some good which is opposed
to the good of God, or to the good of his neighbour, or to
his own good (LXXI. 2; LXX VII. 4).<p>

<i>What is this other good which man can will?</i><p>

It is the good that gratifies his senses, or his ambition,
or his pride (LXXII. 2, 3; LXXVII. 5).<p>

<i>Whence comes it that man can thus will a good that gratifies his senses, or his ambition, or his pride?</i><p>

The reason is because the senses can be borne towards
what is agreeable to them by forestalling or by enticing
the reason and the will which do not oppose this movement 
of the senses when they might and when they should 
(LXXI. 2, ad 3).<p>

<i>It is then the unlawful seeking after sensible and temporal goods which is, for man, the beginning and, in some sort, the reason of all his sins?</i><p>

Yes, it is the unlawful seeking after sensible and
temporal goods that is, for man, the beginning and, in
some sort, the reason of all his sins.<p>

<i>What is this inclination in man to seek unlawfully sensible and temporal goods called?</i><p>

It is called concupiscence (LXXVII. 1-5).<p>

<hr><p>
XII. OF ORIGINAL SIN, AND OF ITS CONSEQUENCES, 
OR OF THE WOUNDING OF HUMAN NATURE<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Did this concupiscence exist in man in the first state in which he was created by God?</i><p>

No.<p>

<i>Why then does it exist now in man?</i><p>

It exists in man now because of his fall 
(LXXXI.-LXXXIII.).
<!--
OF ORIGINAL SIN 75
--><p>

<i>What do you mean by the fall of man?</i><p>

By this is meant that state which followed upon the
first sin of the first man, and which is the effect of this
first sin (LXXXI. 1; LXXXII. 1).<p>

<i>Why are we now all in this state which followed upon the sin of Adam?</i><p>

We are all in this state now because we received our
nature from Adam (LXXXI. 1).<p>

<i>If Adam had not sinned would we have received our nature from him in another state?</i><p>

Yes, if Adam had not sinned we would have received
our nature from him in the state of integrity, or original
justice (LXXXI. 2).<p>

<i>Is the state in which we now receive our nature from Adam a state of sin?</i><p>

Yes, the state in which we now receive our nature
from the first man is a state of sin (LXXXI. 1;
LXXXII. 1).<p>

<i>Why is this nature which we now receive from Adam in a state of sin?</i><p>

Because we receive it from him such as it really is,
that is as affected by his sin (LXXXI. i).<p>

<i>And what is this state called?</i><p>

It is called the state of original sin (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>By the very fact then that we receive our nature in this state from Adam, original sin is transmitted to each one of us?</i><p>

Yes, it is by the very fact that we receive our nature
in this state from Adam that original sin is transmitted
to each one of us (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>What does this state of sin in which each one of us is born, and which is called original sin, entail?</i><p>

It entails the privation of all the supernatural or
gratuitous gifts which God had implanted in our nature
in the person of Adam, our common father (LXXXII. 1).<p>

<i>What were these supernatural or gratuitous gifts, the privation of which constitutes in us the state of original sin?</i><p>

These supernatural or gratuitous gifts were: first of
<!--
76 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA
-->
all, sanctifying grace with the supernaturally infused 
virtues and the gifts of the Holy Spirit; and also the
privilege of integrity which was associated with these
supernatural gifts.<p>

<i>What did this privilege of integrity granted to the soul imply?</i><p>

It implied the entire subordination of the senses to the
reason and of the body to the soul.<p>

<i>What was the effect of this perfect subordination of the senses to reason and of the body to the soul?</i><p>

The effect was that in man's sensitive appetite there
could be no inordinate movement; and his body was
rendered impassable and immortal.<p>

<i>Are death and all other bodily ailments the result of sin?</i><p>

Yes, death and all other bodily ailments are the result
of sin (LXXXIV. 5).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What are the consequences of this sin in the soul called?</i><p>

They are called the wounds of the soul.<p>

<i>What are these wounds in the soul?</i><p>

They are ignorance, malice, weakness, and concupiscence (LXXXV. 3).<p>

<i>What is meant by ignorance?</i><p>

By this is meant that state in which the reason is deprived 
of that inherent relation it had towards the truth
in the state of integrity (LXXXV. 3).<p>

<i>What is meant by malice?</i><p>

By this is meant that state of the will in which it is
deprived of the inherent relation it had to good in the
state of integrity (LXXXV. 3).<p>

<i>What is meant by weakness?</i><p>

By this is meant that state of the sensitive appetite
in which it is deprived of the inherent relation to all that
is arduous and difficult which it had in the state of
integrity (LXXXV. 3).<p>

<i>What is meant by concupiscence?</i><p>

By this is meant that state of the sensitive appetite
<!--
OF ORIGINAL SIN 77
-->
in which it is deprived of the inherent relation towards
sensitive pleasures tempered by reason which it had in
the state of integrity (LXXXV. 3).<p>

<i>Are the four wounds in our nature the effects, properly speaking, of the sin of Adam?</i><p>

Yes, these four wounds in our nature are the effects,
properly speaking, of the sin of Adam (LXXXV. 3).<p>

<i>Are they rendered worse by the personal sins of parents and of individuals?</i><p>

Yes (LXXXV. 1, 2).<p>

<i>Are there certain personal sins which in particular have an evil influence upon man by leading to commit other sins?</i><p>

Yes, they are the capital sins.<p>

<i>What are the capital sins?</i><p>

They are pride, avarice, gluttony, lust, idleness, envy,
and anger.<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>In spite of all these causes of sin in man which come either from the sin of Adam, or from the personal sins of man, may we yet say that man is free in his moral acts, and that he is never necessitated to commit sin?</i><p>

Yes, in spite of all these causes of sin in man which
come either from the first sin of the first man, or from
the personal sins of man, we are bound to say that he
is still free in his moral acts, and that he is never 
necessitated to commit sin.<p>

<i>What would be necessary for man to cease to be free in his acts considering all these consequences of sin?</i><p>

It would be necessary for them to affect man in such
a way as to make him lose his reason (LXXVII. 7).<p>

<i>Unless man then loses his reason he always remains free in his acts in such wise that it depends upon him whether he sin?</i><p>

Yes, unless man loses his reason his acts always remain
free in such wise that it depends upon him whether
he sin.
<!--

--><p>

<i>Can this liberty, however, become less perfect and less virile on account of the consequences of sin, even to the extent that when man relapses into sin he is less culpable?</i><p>

Yes, man's liberty becomes less perfect and less virile
owing to the effects of sin, so much so that when he
relapses into sin he is less culpable, unless his personal
sins are themselves in part cause of this abatement of
his perfect liberty (LXXVII. 6).<p>

<hr><p>
XIII. OF THE DIVERSE GRAVITY OF SINS,
AND OF THE PUNISHMENT DUE TO THEM<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>All the sins that man commits are not then equally grave?</i><p>

No.<p>

<i>Whence arises the degree of gravity in the sins that man commits?</i><p>

A sin is more or less grave according as it is opposed
to the degree of good which should be sought by man,
and according as the sin is in a greater or a lesser degree
voluntary (LXXIII. 1-8).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>Does every sin, as such, deserve to be punished?</i><p>

Yes, every sin, as such, deserves to be punished
(LXXXVII. 1).<p>

<i>Why does every sin, as such, deserve to be punished?</i><p>

Because every sin, as such, is a trespassing of the free
will upon ground to which it has no right of entry; and
punishment is as it were a restitution, made by the will,
of this violation of right (LXXXVII. 1).<p>

<i>The punishment therefore of sin is a question of strict justice?</i><p>

Yes.<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Who inflicts the punishment due to sin?</i><p>

It is always one of three principles which rule the
order against which sin revolts.
<!--
OF THE PUNISHMENT OF SIN 79
--><p>

<i>What are these three principles which rule the order against which sin revolts?</i><p>

The divine law always; human authority in those
things dependent upon it; and the reason of the sinner
according to the degree of his responsibility in sinning
(LXXXVII. 1).<p>

<i>As regards the punishment inflicted on sin, in what way does the reason of the sinner punish sin?</i><p>

The reason of the sinner can punish sin in two
ways: by remorse and by self-inflicted punishment
(LXXXVII. 1).<p>

<i>How does human authority punish sin?</i><p>

Human authority punishes sin by chastisement
(LXXXVII. 1).<p>

<i>And how does the divine law punish sin?</i><p>

The divine law punishes sin in two ways: mediately
and immediately (LXXXVII. 1).<p>

<i>What is meant by saying that the divine law punishes sin mediately?</i><p>

By this is meant that it inflicts punishment on sin
through the medium of the reason of the sinner and of
human authority (LXXXVII. 1).<p>

<i>Why does the divine law punish sin through the medium of the sinner's reason and of human authority?</i><p>

Because the reason of the sinner and human authority
act dependently on the divine law, and are in some
sort its instruments (LXXXVII. 1).<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>Is there not also another way in which the divine law can punish sin as it were mediately?</i><p>

Yes, through the medium of creatures or the order
of things which the sinner disturbs by his sin
(LXXXVII. 1).<p>

<i>Is it in this sense that one may speak of a certain immanent justice?</i><p>

Yes; in this sense there is a kind of immanent justice,
which effects that things used as instruments of divine
<!--
80 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
justice avenge the sin committed in that they thwart the
sinner at every turn (LXXXVII. i).<p>

<i>What is meant by saying that the divine law punishes sin immediately?</i><p>

By this is meant a special supernatural intervention
by which God Himself avenges man's violation of the
supernatural order (LXXXVII. 3-5).<p>

<i>What does this supernatural intervention imply in particular?</i><p>

As regards certain sins, it implies eternal punishment
(LXXX VII. 3,5).<p>

<hr><p>
XIV. OF MORTAL SINS AND VENIAL SINS<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>For what sins does God inflict eternal punishment?</i><p>

For mortal sins (LXXXVII. 3).<p>

<i>What are mortal sins?</i><p>

Mortal sins are those which kill the soul, in that, by
them, charity is lost, which is the principle of the 
supernatural life (LXXXVIII. 3).<p>

<i>Why does God inflict eternal punishment on these sins?</i><p>

Because these sins, making the soul lose that life which
God alone can give, render the sinner incapable of
making reparation for his sin; and thus, since the sin
remains always, the punishment must likewise remain
always (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>Are all the sins man commits mortal sins?</i><p>

No (LXXXVIII. 1, a).<p>

<i>What are the sins called that are not mortal?</i><p>

They are called venial (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>What does the word "venial" mean?</i><p>

It means a sin less grave which does not take away the
principle of the supernatural life, which is charity or
grace, and for which, consequently, reparation can be
made under the ordinary action of grace by a contrary
<!--
OF MORTAL AND VENIAL SIN 81
-->
movement of the sinner himself, and on this head its
punishment is only temporal: hence it is called "venial,"
or easily "pardonable" (from the Latin word <i>venia</i>,
which means pardon) (LXXXVIII. 1).<p>

<i>Supposing venial sins are committed by a man who is in the state of mortal sin, and this man were to die in this state, would his venial sins be punished by eternal punishment?</i><p>

Yes, by reason of his state of soul, and because not
having charity, he would be incapable of making reparation 
for these sins, which, after his death, are eternally
irreparable.<p>

<i>Whence does it arise that some sins are mortal, whereas others are only venial?</i><p>

This arises from the nature of the disorder brought
about by different sins, and from the greater or lesser
voluntariness of sin (LXXXVIII. 2).<p>

<i>What is meant by saying that this difference of mortal from venial sin arises from the nature of the disorder brought about by sin?</i><p>

This means that there are sins which, of themselves,
are directly opposed to the supernatural love of God,
which is the principle of the life of the soul, or that they
are incompatible with this love; whilst other sins bring
about a lesser disorder of an accidental nature which is
compatible with the supernatural love of God existing
habitually in the soul (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>What are those sins which, of themselves, are directly opposed to the supernatural love of God, the principle of the soul's life, or which are incompatible with this love?</i><p>

They are those sins which reject the supernatural
love of God, or which imply an evil and a disorder that
disturb the very essence of man's relation to God, or
the mutual relation of men, or the relation of man to
himself.<p>

<i>What are these sins?</i><p>

These sins are the spurning of the supernatural love
of God, or the sins that violate the honour of God, or
<!--

the sins of theft, homicide, and adultery, or the sins
against nature.<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>What is the best means of knowing exactly these divers sins and their gravity?</i><p>

The best means is to consider them in their relation
with the different virtues taken in specific detail.<p>

<i>Shall we have occasion to study this relation of sins with each of the virtues taken in specific detail?</i><p>

Yes, we shall consider this after having seen, in general,
what is required for man to live a virtuous life by avoiding
a life of sin.<p>

<i>What further remains to be seen, after having considered, in general, what is required for man to live a virtuous life by avoiding a life of sin?</i><p>

There remains to be considered the exterior helps
necessary for man to attain this end.<p>

<i>What are these exterior helps necessary for man to attain this end?</i><p>

They are laws which direct him, and grace which helps.

<hr><p>
XV. OF THE EXTERIOR PRINCIPLE WHICH
DIRECTS MAN'S ACTIONS; OR OF LAW<p>

<i>What is meant by law?</i><p>

By law is meant an order of reason, for the common 
good, made and promulgated by one in authority
(XC. 1-4).<p>

<i>An order then contrary to reason could not be a law?</i><p>

No, an order or a commandment contrary to reason can
never be a law; it is an act of despotism or of tyranny
(XC. 1, ad 3).<p>

<i>What is meant by saying that law is an order of reason ordained to the common good?</i><p>

<i>This means that a law provides first of all for the good of the whole community, and does not concern itself with <!--OF ETERNAL LAW 83 --> a part thereof or of the individual, except in so far as a part or an individual concurs in the general good (XC. 2). From what authority does law emanate?</i><p>

It emanates from him upon whom it is incumbent to
be mindful of the common good as if it were his own
private good (XC. 3).<p>

<i>For a law to bind, is it necessary that it be promulgated and known?</i><p>

Yes, for a law to bind it is necessary that it be 
promulgated in such a way that it come to the knowledge of
those whom it concerns (XC. 4).<p>

<i>And if, through one's own fault, one is ignorant of the law, is one excused for not obeying the law?</i><p>

No; if, through one's own fault, one is ignorant of the
law, one is not excused from obeying the law.<p>

<i>It is then very important to learn fully the laws that concern us?</i><p>

Yes, it is very important to study the laws that
concern us.<p>

<hr><p>
XVI. OF DIVERS LAWS; AND FIRST, OF THE ETERNAL LAW<p>

<i>Are there several kinds of law that concern us?</i><p>

Yes.<p>

<i>What are these different kinds of law?</i><p>

They are the eternal law, the natural law, human law,
and the divine law (XCI. 1-5).<p>

<i>What is the eternal law?</i><p>

The eternal law is the supreme law which rules all
things, and on which all other laws depend, for these
latter are only derivations or particular manifestations
thereof (XCIII. 1, 3).<p>

<i>Where is the eternal law?</i><p>

The eternal law is in God (XCIII. 1).<p>

<i>How is this law manifested in things?</i><p>

It is manifested by the very order of things such as is

XVII. OF THE NATURAL LAW<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Is the eternal law to be found in man by participation?</i><p>

Yes (XCIII. 6).<p>

<i>What is this participation or manifestation of the eternal law in man called?</i><p>

It is called the natural law (XCIV. 1).<p>

<i>What is meant by the natural law?</i><p>

By the natural law is meant that inborn light of man's
practical reason by which he is able to direct himself and
to act with knowledge consciously in such wise that his
acts execute the eternal law, just as the natural actions of
things produced by virtue of their natural inclination
execute this same law unconsciously (XCIV. 1).<p>

<i>Is there a first principle of this practical reason, or a first precept of the natural law in man?</i><p>

Yes, it is that which is founded upon the very nature of
good in the metaphysical sense of the word, just as the
first principle of the speculative reason is founded upon
the nature of being (XCIV. 2).<p>

<i>In what does the first principle of the practical reason or the first precept of the natural law in man consist?</i><p>

It consists in this, that man must seek what is good and
avoid what is evil (XCIV. 2).<p>

<i>Does this first principle or first precept embrace all others?</i><p>

Yes; for the rest are only applications thereof more or
less immediate (XCIV. 2).<p>

<i>What are the first applications thereof in man?</i><p>

The first applications thereof in man are the proclamation 
by man's reason of the threefold good touching his
nature (XCIV. 2). <p>

<i>What is this proclamation of man's reason concerning the threefold good touching his nature?</i><p>

It is this: whatever is beneficial for or perfects his
physical life is good; also, whatever helps towards the 
conservation of the human species; and also whatever conduces
to the welfare of his life as a rational being (XCIV. 2).
<!--
OF NATURAL LAW 85
--><p>

<i>What follows from this threefold proclamation of man's practical reason?</i><p>

There follows from this that whatever is essential for
the conservation of this threefold life, or that can help
towards its perfection, is proclaimed a good thing by the
practical reason of every man, in such a way, however,
that among the three goods there is a certain subordination, 
so that by way of dignity the good of the reason comes
first, then the good of the species, and then the good of
the individual (XCIV. 2).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>As regards the good of the individual, what does the first principle of the natural law proclaim as essential?</i><p>

This principle proclaims that man must eat for the
sustenance of his body, and that he may never attempt
his life (XCIV. 2).<p>

<i>As regards the good of the species, what does the first principle of the natural law proclaim as essential?</i><p>

This principle proclaims that there must be human
beings who concern themselves with the conservation of
the species by taking upon themselves the burden as well
as the joys of fatherhood and motherhood; and that it is
never lawful to do anything which tends to frustrate the
object of fatherhood and motherhood (XCIV. 2).<p>

<i>As regards the good of reason, what does the first principle of the natural law proclaim as essential?</i><p>

This principle proclaims that man, who is the work of
God from whom he has received his all, and who was
made to live in the society of other men, should honour
God as his Sovereign Lord and Master, and should act
towards his fellow-beings according as the nature of his
relations with them demands (XCIV. 2).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Are all other precepts of man's practical reason consequent upon these three first principles and their subordination?</i><p>

Yes, all other precepts or determinations of the practical
<!--
86 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
reason which affirm that this or that thing is or is not
good for this or for that man, and binding him to do or to
refrain from doing, are consequent more or less remotely.
upon these three first principles and their subordination
(XCIV. 2).<p>

<i>Are these other precepts or determinations of the practical reason, which are consequent, more or less remotely, upon the three first principles of the natural law, identical for all men?</i><p>

No, these other precepts or determinations are not the
same for all; for according to the degree one recedes from
first principles, or from those things, which for all are
essential as regards the good of the individual, the good
of the species, and the good of reason, one enters the
sphere of positive precepts, which can vary almost without 
end according to the diversity of individual conditions
of different human beings (XCIV. 4).<p>

<i>Who makes these other precepts which can vary almost without end according to the diversity of the individual conditions of different men?</i><p>

They are made by the individual reason of each human
being or by a competent authority in each of the
different groups of human beings that form some
society in particular.<p>

XVIII. OF HUMAN LAW<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Can these other precepts become the subject-matter of law?</i><p>

Yes.<p>

<i>Of what laws are they the subject-matter?</i><p>

They are the subject-matter, properly speaking, of
human laws (XCV.-XCVII.).<p>

<i>What is meant by human laws?</i><p>

By human laws are meant those ordinations of reason
made for the common good of this or that society of
human beings, which are enacted and promulgated by
the supreme authority of every society (XCVI. 1).
<!--
OF HUMAN LAW 87
--><p>

<i>Must these ordinations be obeyed by all who belong to this society?</i><p>

Yes (XCVI. 5).<p>

<i>Is there here entailed a duty of conscience that binds before God?</i><p>

Yes (XCVI. 4).<p>

<i>Are there certain cases in which one is not obliged to obey?</i><p>

Yes, there can be certain cases in which one is not
obliged to obey (XCVI. 4).<p>

<i>What are these cases in which one is not obliged to obey?</i><p>

In the case of impossibility, or in the case of dispensation 
(XCVI. 4).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>Who can dispense from obeying a law?</i><p>

He only can dispense from obeying a law who is the
maker of the law, or he who has the same authority as
the maker of the law, or he who has received from this
authority the power to dispense (XCVII. 4).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Is one bound to obey an unjust law?</i><p>

No, one is not bound to obey an unjust law, unless the
refusal to obey cause scandal or grave trouble (XCVI. 4).<p>

<i>What is meant by an unjust law?</i><p>

It is one made without authority, or contrary to the
common good, or one that injures the lawful rights of
members of the society (XCVI. 4).<p>

<i>If a law is unjust in that it offends the rights of God or of His Church, is one bound thereto?</i><p>

No, if a law is unjust in that it offends the rights of
God or the essential rights of the Church, one is never
bound thereby (XCVI. 4).<p>

<i>What is meant by the rights of God and the essential rights of the Church?</i><p>

By the rights of God is meant whatever touches the
honour and the worship of God, the Creator and Sovereign 
Master of all things; by the essential rights of the
<!--
88 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
Church is meant whatever touches the mission of the
Catholic Church as regards the sanctification of souls by
the preaching of the truth and the administration of the
sacraments.<p>

<i>If then a human law attacks religion one is not bound to obey this law?</i><p>

If a human law attacks religion one is not bound to
obey at any cost (XCVI. 4).<p>

<i>Would such a law be a true law?</i><p>

No, such a law is a hateful tyranny (XC. 1, ad 3).<p>

<hr><p>
XIX. OF THE DIVINE LAW -- THE DECALOGUE<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>What is meant by the divine law?</i><p>

By the divine law is meant the law given to men by
God who manifests Himself supernaturally (XCI. 4,5).<p>

<i>When did God give this law to men?</i><p>

God gave this law to men in the first place in a very
simple way before their fall in the Garden of Eden; but
He also gave it in a much more elaborate way, later on,
through the medium of Moses and the Prophets, and in a
way much more perfect by Jesus Christ and the Apostles
(XCI. 5).<p>

<i>What is the divine law given by God to men through Moses called?</i><p>

It is called the Old Law (XCVIII. 6).<p>

<i>And what is the divine law called that was given by God to men through Jesus Christ and the Apostles?</i><p>

It is called the New Law (CVI. 3, 4).<p>

<i>Was the Old Law made for all men?</i><p>

No, the Old Law was made for the Jewish people
only (XCVIII. 4, 5).<p>

<i>Why did God give a special law to the Jewish people?</i><p>

Because this people was destined to prepare in the old
<!--
OF THE DECALOGUE 89
-->
world the coming of the Saviour of men who was to be
born of the Jewish nation (XCVIII. 4).<p>

<i>What were the precepts called that were given to the Jewish people and that regarded them only?</i><p>

They were called the "judiciary" precepts, and the
"ceremonial precepts" (XCIX. 3, 4).<p>

<i>Are there not also in the Old Law certain precepts which have remained in the New Law?</i><p>

Yes, and they are called the "moral" precepts
(XCIX. 1, 2).<p>

<i>Why have these precepts of the Old Law been kept in the New Law?</i><p>

Because they constitute what is essential and absolutely
obligatory concerning the conduct of every man, from the
very fact that he is man (C. 1).<p>

<i>These moral precepts then have always been and always will be the same for all men?</i><p>

Yes, these moral precepts have always been and always
will be the same for all men (C. 8).<p>

<i>Are they identified with the natural law?</i><p>

Yes, these moral precepts are identified with the
natural law.<p>

<i>How then are they part of the divine law?</i><p>

They are part of the divine law because in order to
give them more force and to hinder the human reason
from forgetting or corrupting them, God Himself
promulgated them solemnly when He manifested Himself
to His chosen people at the time of Moses; and also
because God promulgated them in view of the super-natural 
end to which every man is called by Him (C. 3).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What are these moral precepts thus solemnly promulgated by God at the time of Moses called?</i><p>

They are called the "Decalogue" (C. 3, 4).<p>

<i>What does the word Decalogue mean?</i><p>

It is a Greek word which means the ten words, for the
number of precepts given by God is ten.
<!--
90 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>What are the ten commandments of the Decalogue?</i><p>

The ten commandments of the Decalogue are the
following:<p>

1. Thou shalt have no other God beside Me.<p>

2. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God
in vain.<p>

3. Thou shalt keep holy the Sabbath day.<p>

4. Honour thy father and thy mother.<p>

5. Thou shalt not kill.<p>

6. Thou shalt not commit adultery.<p>

7. Thou shalt not steal.<p>

8. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy
neighbour.<p>

9. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife.<p>

10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's goods<p>

(C. 4, 5, 6).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Do these ten commandments suffice to guide the whole moral life of man in the way of virtue?</i><p>

Yes, they suffice as regards the principal virtues which
have reference to the essential duties of man towards God
and his neighbour; but for the perfection of all the virtues
it was necessary for them to be further explained and 
completed by the teaching of the prophets in the Old 
Law, and still further by the teaching of Jesus Christ and
the Apostles in the New Law (C. 3, 11).<p>

<i>What is the best way to understand these precepts fully and to understand that which explains or completes them for the perfection of the moral life?</i><p>

It is to study them by help of each of the virtues 
considered in detail.<p>

<i>Will the study of them thus be made easy?</i><p>

Yes, for the very nature of the virtue will explain the
nature and the obligation of the precept.<p>

<i>Will this be at the same time a good way to understand the whole perfection of the New Law?</i><p>

Yes; because the perfection of this law consists precisely 
in its relation with the excellence of all the virtues
(C. 2; CVIII.).
<!--
OF GRACE 91
--><p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>Has this excellence of all the virtues any special character in the New Law?</i><p>

Yes, it has a special character inasmuch as the counsels
are added to the precepts (CVIII. 4).<p>

<i>What is meant by the counsels being added to the precepts?</i><p>

By this is meant certain invitations offered by Jesus
Christ to all souls of good will, to detach themselves
from earthly things for love of Him and in order to
obtain a more perfect enjoyment of Him in heaven,
things that they might indeed desire and possess without
detriment to virtue, but which might prove an obstacle
to the perfection of virtue (CVIII. 4).<p>

<i>How many counsels are there?</i><p>

There are three: poverty, chastity, and obedience
(CVIII. 4).<p>

<i>Is there any special state wherein one may practise these counsels in a very perfect way?</i><p>

Yes, the religious state (CVIII. 4).<p>

XX. OF THE EXTERNAL PRINCIPLE WHICH HELPS 
MAN TO PRACTISE GOOD ACTS; OR OF GRACE<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Is law a sufficient guide for man to live a virtuous life and to avoid the contrary life of sin?</i><p>

No, the help of grace is also necessary (CIX., CXIV.).<p>

<i>What is meant by grace?</i><p>

By grace is meant a special help from God that assists
him to do good and to avoid evil.<p>

<i>Is this special help from God always necessary for man?</i><p>

Yes.
<!--
92 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>Is not man of himself ever able to do any good thing or to avoid any bad thing?</i><p>

Yes, of himself, that is relying on the principle of his
nature given to him by God, and upon the other natural
helps around him, man can accomplish certain good acts
and avoid certain evil acts even in the moral order or in
the domain of virtue; but if God by His grace does not
heal human nature which was wounded by sin, man
would never be able to accomplish even in the order of
natural virtue all the good required of him or to avoid all
evil; moreover, in the order of supernatural virtue or as
regards the good life that is to win heaven, man by his
sole nature, without grace, can do absolutely nothing
(CIX. 1-10).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What does this grace of the supernatural order imply?</i><p>

This grace of the supernatural order implies two
things: a supernatural state of soul, and supernatural
motions of the Holy Spirit (CIX. 6).<p>

<i>What is meant by this supernatural state of soul?</i><p>

By this is meant certain qualities introduced and
preserved therein by God which in a sense make the very
being and faculties of man divine (CX. 1-4).<p>

<i>What is the fundamental quality which makes man's very being divine?</i><p>

It is called habitual or sanctifying grace (CX. 1, 2, 4).<p>

<i>What are the supernatural qualities which divinize man's faculties?</i><p>

They are the virtues and the gifts (CX. 3).<p>

<i>Are the virtues and the gifts associated with habitual or sanctifying grace?</i><p>

Yes, the virtues and the gifts are associated with
habitual or sanctifying grace in such wise that they issue
from this grace which can never exist in the soul unless
they also exist in the faculties.
<!--
OF GRACE 93
--><p>

<i>Are this grace, and these virtues and gifts, which sanctify the soul and its faculties something very estimable?</i><p>

Yes, for they make man a child of God, and give him
the power to act as such.<p>

<i>Is man, endowed with grace and the accompanying virtues and gifts, more perfect than the whole created world in the order of nature?</i><p>

Yes, he is more perfect even than the angels if we
consider them in their nature only (CXIII. 9, ad 2).<p>

There is then nothing on earth more to be desired by
man than to possess and keep, and by making daily
progress in this grace of God together with the virtues
and the gifts.<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>How can man thus possess and keep the virtues and the gifts and make daily progress in this grace of God?</i><p>

By responding faithfully to the supernatural motion of
the Holy Spirit, who solicits man to prepare himself to
receive grace if he has it not, or to make daily progress
therein if he already possesses it (CXII. 3; CXIII. 3, 5).<p>

<i>What is this action of the Holy Spirit called?</i><p>

This action of the Holy Spirit is called actual grace
(CIX. 6; CXII. 3).<p>

<i>It is then with this help or through the motion of actual grace that we dispose ourselves to receive habitual or sanctifying grace if we have it not already, or if we have it, to make progress therein?</i><p>

Yes, it is with this help or through the motion of actual
grace that we dispose ourselves to receive habitual or
sanctifying grace if we have it not already, or if we have it,
to make progress therein.<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>Can actual grace produce its full effect in us, in spite of us, and without our response?</i><p>

No, actual grace cannot produce its full effect in us, in
spite of us, and without our response (CXIII. 3).
<!--
94 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>It is necessary then for our free will to co-operate with the motion of actual grace?</i><p>

Yes, our free will must co-operate with the motion of
actual grace.<p>

<i>What is the co-operation of the free will with the motion of actual grace called?</i><p>

It is called correspondence with grace.<p>

<center>(E)</center><p>

<i>When our free will corresponds thus with actual grace, and we have habitual grace in our soul, has the act any special character?</i><p>

Yes, it is always a meritorious act (CXIV. 1, 2).<p>

<i>Are there several kinds of merit?</i><p>

Yes, there is merit <i>de condigno</i> and merit <i>de congruo</i>
(CXIV. 2).<p>

<i>What is understood by merit "de condigno"?</i><p>

It is the merit that demands recompense by right and
in strict justice (CXIV. 2).<p>

<i>What is required for man's act to be meritorious "de condigno"?</i><p>

The act must be done under the impulse of actual
grace; it must proceed from sanctifying grace by the 
virtue of charity; and it must tend towards the acquisition
of eternal life for itself alone, or further, towards the
increase of grace and of the virtues (CXIV. 2, 4).<p>

<i>Is it possible to merit for others life eternal, or sanctifying grace, or the increase of this grace by merit which is "de condigno"?</i><p>

No, it is impossible to merit this kind of boons for others 
except by merit <i>de congruo</i>; for to merit <i>de condigno</i> 
for others is proper to Jesus Christ, the Head of the Church 
(CXIV. 5, 8).<p>

<i>What is understood by merit "de congruo"?</i><p>

By this it is understood that merit which effects that 
God by reason of the friendship that unites Him to the
just, deems it fitting and in accord with His wishes, to
respond to the joy that they seek to give Him by their
<!--
OF GRACE 95
-->
good works, in Himself giving joy to them by granting
what they ask or what they desire of Him (CXIV. 6).<p>

<i>Then the whole "raison d'&ecirc;tre" of merit is reduced to this, that God moves intimately in the life of the just through grace and the virtues under the action of the Holy Ghost?</i><p>

Yes, it is always in the intimacy between God and the
just, or in their life of grace and the virtues under the
action of the Holy Spirit, that consists the whole raison
d'&ecirc;tre of merit; moreover, whatever man does outside
this life, even though in itself it is not evil, is altogether
vain and will avail him nothing at the last day (CXIV. 6).<p>

<i>Can this life of grace and the virtues to be lived by man on earth be explained in detail?</i><p>

Yes, all this will be explained in its proper place when
we study man's return to God by his good acts.
