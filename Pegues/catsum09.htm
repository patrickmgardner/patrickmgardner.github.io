XXXIX. OF THE PART OF THE PENITENT IN THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE; 
OF CONTRITION, CONFESSION, AND SATISFACTION<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Has the penitent a part in the effect of this sacrament?</i><p>

Yes, because the acts he performs are part of the 
sacrament itself (XC. 1).<p>

<i>In what way do the acts of the penitent form a part of this sacrament?</i><p>

The acts of the penitent make part of the sacrament of
Penance, because in this sacrament the acts of the minister
give the form whilst those of the penitent constitute the
matter (XC. 1).<p>

<i>What are these acts of the penitent which constitute the matter of this sacrament?</i><p>

They are contrition, confession, and satisfaction
(XC. 2).<p>

<i>Why are these three acts required as the matter of the sacrament of Penance?</i><p>

Because it is the sacrament of reconciliation between a
sinner and God. But in a reconciliation of this nature,
the sinner must give to God some compensation which is
pleasing to Him in such wise that the sin is pardoned and
its effect blotted out. For this three things are necessary:
(1) That the sinner have the will to offer that compensation
such as it pleases God to determine; (2) that he come
to the priest who stands in the place of God to receive the
conditions of this compensation; (3) that he offer the
compensation and acquit himself thereof faithfully.
These three things are fulfilled by contrition, confession,
and satisfaction (XC. 2).<p>

<i>Can the sacrament of Penance exist without one or other of these parts?</i><p>

It cannot exist without a certain exterior manifestation
of these different parts; but it can exist without the
<!--
OF PENANCE 275
-->
interior reality of contrition or without the fulfilling of
the satisfaction; but in either case the virtue of the
sacrament is hindered or paralyzed (XC. 3).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What is meant by contrition?</i><p>

It is that sorrow, of the supernatural order, which the
sinner has in thinking of the sins he has committed;
thereon he resolves to go to the priest, the minister of
God, in order to confess them and to receive some penalty
in satisfaction which he resolves to perform faithfully
(Supplement, I. 1).<p>

<i>What is necessary for this sorrow to be supernatural?</i><p>

In order to be supernatural it is necessary for this
sorrow to be caused by some motive which refers to the
order of grace; this motive may commence with the fear
of punishment with which, as one knows by faith, God
threatens the sinner; so with the hope of obtaining
pardon one does penance, whereby one comes to detest
the sin in itself which threatens death to the soul, or
at least in so far as it is contrary to one's supernatural
good and perfect life, and above all, by reason that it
offends God, the supreme object of our love (I. 1, 2).<p>

<i>If one detest sin for the sole reason of the punishment which God will inflict for sin either in this life or the next, would one have contrition?</i><p>

No, for to have contrition it is necessary to detest
sin because of the evil it does the soul; this evil is the loss
of God, who can be possessed by us in this life through
grace, and in the next life by glory (I. 2).<p>

<i>What then is that sorrow called which consists in detesting sin only because of the fear of punishment?</i><p>

It is called attrition (I. 2, <i>Obj.</i> 2).<p>

<i>What then is the precise difference between attrition and contrition?</i><p>

The first is sorrow for sin caused by a motive of servile
fear; whereas contrition is caused by a motive of filial
fear or of the pure love of God (I. 2).
<!--
276 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>Does attrition suffice in order to obtain pardon of one's sins in the sacrament of Penance?</i><p>

With attrition one may approach the sacrament of
Penance; at the moment, however, of receiving the grace
of the sacrament by the absolution of the priest, this
attrition is succeeded in the soul by contrition (I. 3).<p>

<i>Must contrition be directed to all sins committed?</i><p>

Yes, and in particular at the beginning of the movement 
of sorrow for sins, especially if the sins be mortal;
but at the end of this movement of sorrow it is sufficient
that sorrow be directed in a general way towards the sins
committed by detesting sin as an offence against God
(II. 3,6).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>How may one make an act of contrition?</i><p>

In this wise: "O my God, I am sorry from the bottom
of my heart for having committed many sins which
deserve to be severely punished by Thee; my sins have
taken away Thy grace from me because they have
wronged Thine infinite goodness. Have mercy on me
and deign to pardon me; give me once more Thy holy
grace that I may live and grow therein until the day of
my death. Willingly I accept from Thy hands all the
pains and the sufferings Thou hast destined for me; and
I unite them with the sufferings and death of my beloved
Saviour Jesus Christ in expiation of my sins, so that I
may never be separated from Thee again."<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>What must the sinner do after having conceived sorrow for his sins, whether this sorrow be attrition or contrition?</i><p>

He must go to the priest and confess his sins (VI. 1-5).<p>

<i>When does the Church oblige one to confess?</i><p>

For all the faithful once a year, at Easter time by
preference, by reason of the Easter communion which no
one may receive if he have mortal sin on his soul
(VI. 5; Code, Canon 906).
<!--
OF PENANCE 277
--><p>

<i>Why is confession necessary in order to receive the sacrament of Penance?</i><p>

Because it is only by confession that the penitent can
make known his sins to the priest, whose duty it is to
judge whether the penitent is worthy to receive absolution, 
and to impose some Penance as satisfaction for the
sins committed, in order that a just compensation might
be offered to God for the renewal of His grace (VI. 1).<p>

<i>What does confession entail for the sacrament to be valid?</i><p>

As far as possible the sinner must make known to the
priest in detail the number and the species of mortal sins
committed; and he must confess them with a view to
obtaining the sacramental absolution from the priest
(IX. 2).<p>

<i>If at the moment of self-accusation the sinner lack both contrition and attrition for his sins, does the absolution given by the priest remit the sins?</i><p>

No, they are not remitted; but they would be confessed, 
and there would be no need of repeating them to
the priest again in order for them to be remitted by the
virtue of the sacrament; it is sufficient for the sinner to
conceive contrition for them and to accuse himself in
his next confession of the want of contrition in his 
preceding confession (IX. 1).<p>

<i>If one has forgotten to confess some mortal sin in confession, and afterwards one remembers, is one bound to confess this sin in the next confession?</i><p>

Yes, because every mortal sin must be submitted
directly to the power of the keys (IX. 2).<p>

<i>In what capacity does the priest receive the confession of the sinner?</i><p>

He receives it in the name and in the place of God
Himself; and this in such wise that in his life as man,
and outside his ministry as confessor, he knows nothing
whatever of the sins confessed to him (XI. 1).
<!--
278 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<center>(E)</center><p>

<i>After the confession what must the penitent do?</i><p>

He must with the greatest care perform the Penance 
imposed upon him by the priest in the name of God (XII. 1, 3).<p>

<i>What are the different kinds of Penances one may perform in satisfaction for sin?</i><p>

They all come under these three good works: almsgiving, 
fasting, and prayer. Indeed, for satisfaction's
sake, we should deprive ourselves of something in order
to offer it to God in His honour. Now there are three
sorts of goods which we can thus offer to God: the goods
of our fortune; the goods of the body; and the goods
of the soul. The offerings of the first come under the
name of almsgiving; of the second under the general
name of fasting; and of the third under the general name
of prayer (XV. 3).<p>

<i>If one does not perform the Penance imposed by the priest, does one lose the grace of the sacrament?</i><p>

No, unless one voluntarily omits it through contempt;
but if it come about by forgetfulness or by negligence,
the grace of remission in the sacrament endures; but
always, in justice to God, the penalty due to the sin must
be paid either in this or in the next world; moreover, the
grace of the sacrament does not receive that increase
attaching to the performance of the sacramental Penance
(Third Part, XC. 2, <i>Obj.</i> 2).<p>

<hr><p>
XL. OF THE MINISTER OF THE SACRAMENT OF PENANCE, 
AND OF THE POWER OF THE KEYS: OF ABSOLUTION; 
OF INDULGENCES; OF THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS; 
AND OF EXCOMMUNICATION<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>What is meant by the power of the keys?</i><p>

It is nothing more than that power which opens the
gate of heaven by removing an obstacle which prevents
<!--
OF PENANCE 279
-->
entrance thereto, namely sin and the punishment due to
sin (XVII. 1).<p>

<i>Where is this power?</i><p>

First of all it is in the Holy Trinity as in its primary
source; then in the sacred humanity of Jesus Christ, by
the merit of whose Passion the twofold obstacle above
mentioned was removed, and which also by its own
power removes this obstacle; also because the efficacy of
the Passion of Jesus Christ lives in the sacraments, which
are channels, as it were, of His grace by which men participate 
in all its merits. It follows then that the ministers
of the Church, who are the dispensers of the sacraments,
have also the power of the keys which they have received
from Christ Himself (XVII. 1).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>In what way is the power of the keys exercised in the sacrament of Penance?</i><p>

It is exercised by the act of the priest judging the state
or the dispositions of the sinner, and in giving him absolution 
and a penance; or in refusing him this absolution
(XVII. 2).<p>

<i>Is it at the moment that the priest gives absolution, and is it by virtue of this absolution that the effect of this sacrament is produced, namely the remission of sins?</i><p>

Yes; and without this absolution there would be no
sacrament, nor would there be deliverance from sin
(X. 1, 2; XVIII. 1).<p>

<i>Have priests only the power of the keys?</i><p>

Only priests validly ordained according to the rite of
the Catholic Church have this power (XIX. 3).<p>

<i>Is it sufficient for a priest to be validly ordained in order to have this power of the keys over any baptized person who wishes to receive the sacrament of Penance?</i><p>

No; it is also necessary for him to be approved by the
Church in order to hear confessions, and also that the
person who desires the sacrament of Penance be under
his jurisdiction (XX. 1-3).
<!--
280 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>Has every priest who has the power, and whose duty it is to hear confession in a certain place, the right to absolve all who present themselves before him?</i><p>

Yes, unless these persons accuse themselves of sins
that are reserved to a higher power; and of this he himself 
judges in hearing the confession of those that present
themselves.<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Is there in the Church, attaching to the power of the keys, a power which frees man from the penalties due to sin, other than by sacramental absolution and the imposition of a Penance?</i><p>

Yes; and it is the power of the indulgence (XXV. 1).<p>

<i>In what does this power consist?</i><p>

It consists in this, that the Church from the infinite and
inexhaustible treasures of the merits of Jesus Christ, of
our Blessed Lady, and of the saints, can take, in satisfaction 
for sin, what corresponds in all or in part to the
satisfaction which the sinner owes to the justice of God
in this or in the next world. The power also extends to
this, that an indulgence can be applied to certain particular 
individuals, and by the effect of this application
they are freed from their debt towards the justice of
God (XXV. 1).<p>

<i>What is required in order to make this application?</i><p>

Three things are necessary: he who makes this application 
must have the authority to do so; there must be a
state of grace in him to whom the application is made;
and a motive of piety which is the reason for making
the application, that is, something that refers to God's
honour or to the welfare of the Church, as pious
practices, works of zeal or of the apostolate, almsgiving,
and the rest (XXV. 2).<p>

<i>These works which are the motive or the reason of the indulgence, are they the price thereof?</i><p>

In no wise, for an indulgence is not the remission of a
penalty which can be bought (XXV. 2).
<!--
OF INDULGENCES 281
--><p>

<i>Is it only those who fulfil the conditions above mentioned who benefit by the indulgence?</i><p>

They may themselves give this benefit to another, by
gaining the indulgence for this other; for instance an
indulgence may be gained for the benefit of the souls in
purgatory when he who concedes the indulgence gives
such faculty (XVII. 3, <i>Obj.</i> 2 Code, Canon 930).<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>Who can thus concede indulgences?</i><p>

He alone has the power to concede indulgences to
whom the treasures of the merits of Christ and the saints
are confided, by reason of the power he has received
of binding or loosing those who belong to the mystical
Body of Jesus Christ on earth, that is to say the Sovereign
Pontiff. But also bishops may grant certain indulgences,
according as is determined by the Sovereign Pontiff, to
those who come under their jurisdiction (XXVII. 1-3).<p>

<i>What follows from so marvellous a power existing in the Catholic Church, and in it alone, by reason of the supreme authority of the Sovereign Pontiff?</i><p>

From this marvellous power, joined as it is to the power
of the keys in the sacrament of Penance, and in a general
way in all that touches the communication in the merits
of Jesus Christ, it follows that there can be no greater
blessedness for man on earth than to be incorporated, by
Baptism, in the Catholic Church, and to have the power
of participating in all the rights and privileges which
Baptism confers. He is thereby in perfect communion
with all its members and with its head, the Roman
Pontiff to whose care are confided all the treasures of
those spiritual goods that can be distributed among men.<p>

<center>(E)</center><p>

<i>Can it happen that one who is incorporated into the Catholic Church by Baptism does not participate in the privileges that Baptism confers?</i><p>

Yes, it is the case of those who have fallen under the
<!--
282 CATECHISM OF THE SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
censures of the Church; and the worst of all is 
excommunication (XXI. 1, 2).<p>

<i>Are heretics and schismatics excommunicated?</i><p>

Yes; they have no part in the communion of saints.<p>

<i>It is then only Catholics subject to the Roman Pontiff and not branded with censure who can fully enjoy the privileges of the Church?</i><p>

Yes; and in order to participate in the privilege of
indulgences they must be by grace and charity in the
communion of saints.<p>

<center>(F)</center><p>

<i>What precisely is the communion of saints?</i><p>

It is that union among the members of the mystical
Body of Jesus Christ, who are yet on earth, or who are
in purgatory, or who are in heaven, whereby without
ceasing they communicate with each other by reason of
eternal happiness which one day will be common to all in
heaven.<p>

<hr><p>
XLI. OF THE SACRAMENT OF EXTREME UNCTION<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>What is the sacrament which, when he is about to die, prepares man for his entrance into heaven?</i><p>

It is the sacrament of Extreme Unction (XXIX. 1).<p>

<i>What is this sacrament?</i><p>

It is that holy rite instituted by Jesus Christ, that
consists in anointing with the holy oils one who is about
to die; God is asked to remit whatsoever remains of
spiritual weakness which is due to past sin, so that the
soul might recover fully and perfectly its spiritual health;
with this renewed vigour of soul man is prepared to
enter the glory of heaven (XXIX.-XXXII.).<p>

<i>Does this sacrament remit sins?</i><p>

No, for it is not ordained either against original sin as
is Baptism, nor against mortal sin as is Penance, nor in
<!--
OF EXTREME UNCTION 283                
-->
a sense against venial sins, as is the Holy Eucharist; but
its object is to restore strength to the soul after the evil
of sin has been taken away. However, by reason of the
special grace it confers which is incompatible with sin,
it can remit indirectly the sins which are in the soul,
provided there be no obstacle on the part of the person;
that is to say if the person is in good faith and has done
all he can to get rid of them (XXX. 1).<p>

<i>Does Extreme Unction also bring back health to the body?</i><p>

Yes; indeed it is one of the proper effects of this sacrament 
to do this, and in such wise that always, provided
the person puts no obstacle in the way, the virtue of this
sacrament brings back physical strength and bodily
health; and this it does in such measure that the
spiritual health may be benefited thereby, for this latter
is the primary and principal effect of the sacrament
(XXX. 2).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>When may one and when ought one to receive this sacrament?</i><p>

One may receive it in sickness or bodily failing which
puts one in danger of death; one should strive to receive
the sacrament in the full state of consciousness so as to
receive it with the greatest possible fervour (XXXII. 1, 2).<p>

<i>May one receive this sacrament several times?</i><p>

One may not receive it more than once in one and the
same danger of death. But if after having received it
health is recovered, or at least danger of death ceases,
one may receive it as often as there are subsequent
dangers of death, by reason of the different sicknesses;
and if one and the same sickness is prolonged to a great
length of time, the sacrament may again be received
(XXXIII. 1, 2).<p>

<i>Is Extreme Unction the last sacrament instituted by our Lord to give to men the benefit of the life of His grace?</i><p>

Yes, it is the last sacrament to give grace to man in so
far as he is an individual. But there are two other sacra<!--
284 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->ments of great importance which bring to men this life
of grace in so far as they form part of a society, and these
are the sacraments of Holy Orders and Matrimony.<p>

<hr><p>
XLII. OF THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS;
OF PRIESTS, BISHOPS, AND THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF; 
AND OF THE CHURCH, MOTHER OF SOULS<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>What is the sacrament of Holy Orders?</i><p>

It is that sacred rite instituted by Jesus Christ in order
to confer on certain men a special power whereby they
are enabled to consecrate His Body for the benefit of
His mystical Body (XXXVII. 2).<p>

<i>Is this power that is conferred one or manifold?</i><p>

It is manifold; but this does not prejudice the unity
of the sacrament of Holy Orders, for the inferior orders
are a participation of the higher order (XXXVII. 2).<p>

<i>What is this higher order?</i><p>

It is the order of priests who receive at their consecration 
the power to consecrate the Holy Eucharist
(XXXVII. 2).<p>

<i>And what are the inferior orders?</i><p>

They are all the orders below the priesthood whose duty'
it is to minister to the priest in the act of consecration.
First of all come those who serve the priest at the altar,
namely the deacons, sub-deacons and the acolytes: the
first of these have the power of distributing the Holy
Eucharist at least under the species of wine on those
occasions when the Holy Eucharist is distributed under
both species; the second prepare the matter of the
sacrament in the holy vessels; and the third present this
matter. Then come those whose office it is to prepare
the recipients of the sacrament, not by sacramental 
absolution which the priest alone has the power to give, but by
turning away those that are unworthy, or by instructing
<!--
OF HOLY ORDERS 285
-->
the catechumens, or by exorcising the possessed: all of
which offices had their raison d'&ecirc;tre in the primitive
Church, and they have always been kept in the Church
in order to safeguard the integrity of its hierarchy
(XXXVII. 2).<p>

<i>Which of these orders are called major orders, and which minor orders?</i><p>

The major orders are the priesthood, diaconate, and
sub-diaconate. The minor orders are four in number,
viz., the acolytes, the exorcists, the readers, and the 
doorkeepers (XXXVII. 2, 3).<p>

<i>Where are these orders to be found, as a general rule, with the exception of the priesthood?</i><p>

They are to be found in ecclesiastical establishments,
where the members of the clergy are educated and are
prepared for the priesthood.<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>Has the priest a special character which distinguishes him from other men in the Church of God?</i><p>

Not only the priest but all the members of the ecclesiastical 
hierarchy have a certain special character impressed
upon their soul when they receive the sacrament of Orders.
This character is more marked in the major orders, and
more still upon those who have received the priesthood,
to whom is given the power to consecrate the Body and
Blood of Jesus Christ, and to remit sins.<p>

<i>In truth then the faithful owe all to the priest as regards the boons of grace and salvation that are attached to the sacraments?</i><p>

Yes, with the one exception of the sacrament of Confirmation, 
which is ordinarily reserved to the bishop.
It is the priest who gives to the faithful the sacraments
which are ordained to the welfare of their individual life,
viz., Baptism, the Holy Eucharist, Penance, and Extreme
Unction. It is also the priest who has that supreme
power of making really present among men and of offering
up in sacrifice the Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.
<!--
286 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>Is it not also the priest who gives to the faithful that inestimable benefit which is the knowledge of the mysteries of the Christian religion, and of the truths of salvation?</i><p>

Yes, it is the priest's office and duty to teach them all
these truths.<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>From whom does the priest receive these powers?</i><p>

He receives them from the bishop (XXXVIII. 1;
XL. 4).<p>

<i>In what way is a bishop superior to a priest, and how can he give these powers to the priest?</i><p>

The bishop is superior to the priest not as regards the
consecration of the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ in
the Holy Eucharist, but as regards what refers to the
mystical Body of Jesus Christ, which are the faithful in
the Church. It is for the welfare of this mystical Body
that the episcopal power was instituted by Jesus Christ.
This power comprises all that is necessary for the coming
into being and the organization of the mystical Body
in order to communicate in its fulness the life of grace
through the sacraments. Consequently a bishop possesses 
the fulness of the priesthood, being able not
only to consecrate the Body and Blood of our Lord as
every priest is able to do, but also without reserve to
administer all the other sacraments, including Confirmation; 
further, he gives to priests and to the lesser ministers
their power of order by consecrating or ordaining them,
and he gives them their power of jurisdiction over the
faithful (XL. 4, 5).<p>

<i>In some sort then the whole life of the Church is concentrated in the person of the bishop?</i><p>

Yes, this is so.<p>

<i>What is required for a bishop to be this principle of life in his diocese?</i><p>

He must be in full and perfect communion with the
Bishop of Rome, who is the head of all the Churches in
the world over which he has supreme authority, and
which form the Church of Jesus Christ (XL. 6).
<!--
OF HOLY ORDERS 287
--><p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>Has the Bishop of Rome or the Sovereign Pontiff powers which other bishops have not?</i><p>

As regards the administration of the sacraments his
powers are the same as those of other bishops. But as
regards the power of jurisdiction, which refers to the
government of the Church, and to the administration of
the sacraments to such and such particular individuals,
his power is absolute and extends to the Church in the
entire universe; whereas the power of jurisdiction of
other bishops extends only to a part of the universal
Church, viz., to their own diocese; but even as regards
their own diocese, their power derives its nature and
its exercise from the power of the Sovereign Pontiff
(XL. 6).<p>

<i>Why does this supreme power in the order of jurisdiction belong to the Sovereign Pontiff?</i><p>

Because the perfect unity of the Church demands that
this supreme power should belong to him alone. For
this reason Jesus Christ charged Simon Peter to feed
His flock; and the Roman Pontiff is the one and only
legitimate successor of St. Peter unto the end of time
(XL. 6).<p>

<i>It is then from the Sovereign Pontiff that depends every man's union with Jesus Christ through the sacraments, and consequently his supernatural life and eternal salvation?</i><p>

Yes; for although it is true that the grace of Jesus
Christ is not in an absolute way dependent upon the
reception of the sacraments themselves when it is impossible 
to receive them, at least in the case of adults --
and that the action of the Holy Ghost can supplement
this defect provided the person is not in bad faith; it is,
on the other hand, absolutely certain that no one who
separates himself knowingly from communion with the
Sovereign Pontiff can participate in the grace of Jesus
Christ, and that in consequence if he dies in that state
he is irremediably lost.
<!--
288 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>Is it then in this sense that it is said no one can be saved outside the Church?</i><p>

Yes, for no one can hold God as his Father who does
hold the Church for his Mother.<p>

<hr><p>
XLIII. OF THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY; OF ITS NATURE, IMPEDIMENTS, DUTIES;
OF DIVORCE; OF SUBSEQUENT MARRIAGE; AND OF ESPOUSALS<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>What is that sacrament instituted by Jesus Christ which by grace perfects the life of those whose duty regards the continuance of human ltfe in the society?</i><p>

It is the sacrament of Matrimony (XLII.).<p>

<i>In what way is this sacrament ordained to the good of society in the supernatural order?</i><p>

By the fact that it is ordained to the propagation of the
human species whose members are called to be part of
a supernatural society (XLI., XLII.).<p>

<i>What is the sacrament of Matrimony?</i><p>

It is a union between man and woman, indissoluble
until the death of one of the parties, and which of itself
excludes all participation of a third. This union is 
contracted between baptized persons by mutual consent;
by this contract each is given to the other, so that each
in regard to the other has the right to certain acts, that
children may be born to them for the continuance of
society (XLI., XLII.).<p>

<i>Why has this union at the moment it is contracted the nature of a sacrament?</i><p>

Because Jesus Christ wished it so; and He wished to
elevate Matrimony to the dignity of signifying His own
union with the Church (XLII. 2).
<!--
OF MATRIMONY 289
--><p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What is necessary on the part of the two who wish to make this contract?</i><p>

It is necessary for both parties to be free to dispose of
themselves, and that there be no obstacle opposing their
union.<p>

<i>What obstacles can oppose this union?</i><p>

They are those that are called the impediments of
Matrimony.<p>

<i>Are all these impediments of the same nature?</i><p>

No, for some of them make Matrimony illicit, whereas
others make it null and void: the former are called
prohibitory impediments, and the latter diriment 
impediments (Code, Canon 1036).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>What are the prohibitory impediments?</i><p>

They are the simple vow of virginity, the vow of perfect 
chastity or of not getting married, the vow of receiving 
Holy Orders, the vow of embracing the religious
state; legal parentage, which results from adoption, in
those countries where the civil law makes this a 
prohibitory impediment; lastly, the mixed marriage when one
of the two baptized parties is a member of an heretical
or schismatical sect (Code, Canons 1058, 1059, 1060).<p>

<i>When one of these impediments exists what is to be done so that marriage may take place?</i><p>

It is necessary to ask the Church's dispensation from
the impediment; and this the Church does not grant
except for grave reasons, especially in the case of a mixed
marriage; in this latter case the Church exacts that the
non-Catholic party shall do nothing to hinder the other
from practising the Catholic religion, and that the
children born of the marriage shall receive both Catholic
baptism and bringing up (Code, Canon 1061).<p>

<i>If one of the parties, without belonging to an heretical or schismatical sect, be notoriously impious and have <!--290 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA" --> rejected the Catholic faith and have joined some society condemned by the Church, would there in this case be an impediment of marriage?</i><p>

No, not in the sense that the Church's dispensation is
necessary, but the Church desires that all the faithful
should avoid such unions because of the perils of all sorts
attaching thereto (Code, Canon 1065).<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>What are the diriment impediments of Matrimony?</i><p>

The following, and they are such as are to be found in
the new Code of Canon Law: (1) Immature age, that is
before sixteen complete years for the man, and before
fourteen complete years for the woman; (2) impotency
anterior to marriage and perpetual, whether on the part
of the man or on the part of the woman, whether known
or not known, whether absolute or relative; (3) the
fact of being already married even though the marriage
has not been consummated; (4) disparity of religion
when one of the parties is not baptized, and the other has
been baptized in the Catholic Church, or has returned to
the Church by being converted from schism or heresy;
(5) the fact of being in Holy Orders; (6) the fact of
having taken solemn vows in religion, or also simple
vows provided the Holy See has determined that these
simple vows render marriage null and void; (7) rape
or detention by force with a view to marriage, until
the person so detained have the full use of liberty;
(8) adultery with the promise, or the civil attempt, of
marriage, or adultery followed by murder of the married
partner committed by one of the two delinquents -- or the
co-operation, without adultery, whether physical or
moral, in the murder of the married partner; (9) 
consanguinity in direct line of descent always, and 
collaterally to the third degree inclusively, and this impediment
is multiplied according as the root or stock common to
the two parties is multiplied; (10) affinity in the direct
line always, and collaterally to the second degree in<!--
OF MATRIMONY 291
-->clusively, and this impediment is multiplied according
as the impediment of consanguinity which is the cause is
multiplied, or by a subsequent marriage with a blood
relation of the dead partner; (11) public honesty arising
from an invalid marriage whether consummated or not,
and from public concubinage -- this makes marriage null
and void in the first and second degree in the direct line
between a man and the blood relations of the woman,
and vice versa; (12) spiritual parentage contracted
between a person baptized and the one who baptizes and
the godfather or the godmother; (13) legal parentage by
adoption -- if the civil law holds this as an obstacle to the
validity of marriage it becomes by the virtue of Canon
Law a diriment impediment (Code, Canons 1067-1080;
L.-LXII.).<p>

<center>(E)</center><p>

<i>Does the Church ever dispense from these diriment impediments?</i><p>

She never dispenses and indeed she cannot dispense
from those diriment impediments that arise from strict
natural law or the divine law, as are, for instance, 
impotency, or the consummated marriage, or consanguinity
in the direct line, or in the collateral line between two
very nearly related as brother and sister. But as regards
the other impediments which in the main are due to her
own ruling she can dispense from them, but only does
so for very grave reasons.<p>

<i>Is there not a diriment impediment that does not refer to the condition of the contracting parties, but is extrinsic to them?</i><p>

Yes; and it is the impediment of clandestinity.<p>

<i>What is clandestinity?</i><p>

It is a law of the Church which declares null and void
the marriage contracted between baptized Catholics, or
those who sometime or other were Catholics -- and between
baptized and non-Catholics whether the latter be baptized 
or not -- and between Latins and Orientals-if the
marriage is not contracted before the parish priest or
<!--
292 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
before the bishop of the place, or before a priest delegated
for this purpose, with at least the presence of two witnesses. 
If the parish priest or the bishop absolutely
cannot be present or only under the greatest difficulties,
and there is danger of death to one of the parties, or the
difficulties be of such nature that it is impossible for either
the parish priest or the bishop to be present for the space
of a month, the marriage can be contracted validly with
the testimony of two witnesses only (Code, Canons 
1094-1099).<p>

<center>(F)</center><p>

<i>When all necessary conditions are present what must the two to be married do in order to receive the sacrament, and who is the minister of the sacrament?</i><p>

The two parties must give themselves each to the other,
actually, by free consent, without constraint or being
forced thereto by grave fear; the consent must be formal
and mutual, manifested by words or signs about which
there can be no mistake; and the two contracting parties
are themselves the ministers of the sacrament of 
Matrimony (Code, Canons 5085-5087; XLVII. 1-6).<p>

<center>(G)</center><p>

<i>If there is any error on the part of those contracting marriage, is the consent, which makes the marriage, invalid?</i><p>

If this error touches the person of either party the
marriage is null; but if it touches the qualities of the
person it is illicit (Code, Canon 5083).<p>

<i>Is it a good thing on the occasion of the celebration of marriage for the contracting parties to assist at a special Mass in which their union is blessed by the priest?</i><p>

Yes; and the Church wishes that all her children before
receiving this great sacrament in which a special grace
is conferred on them that they might fulfil the duties
of their married life, should dispose themselves to receive
this grace in all its fulness by a good confession and a
fervent communion (Code, Canon 1101).
<!--
OF MATRIMONY 293
--><p>

<center>(H)</center><p>

<i>What is the special grace attaching to the sacrament of Matrimony?</i><p>

It is the grace of perfect conjugal harmony which
inspires a true, lasting, and supernatural affection; it is of
such nature that it is able to resist all that might compromise 
this affection, until death; at the same time
this grace brings with it a generosity whereby shortcomings 
and trials are overcome as regards the children
which by the blessing of God may be the fruit of this
union; and to this effect that they do nothing whatsoever
that may hinder the coming into the world of their
children. Moreover, this grace helps the parents to
watch over their children with jealous care so that they
may be healthy and strong both in body and soul
(XLIX 1-6).<p>

<center>(I)</center><p>

<i>Can a validly contracted marriage be dissolved by civil divorce?</i><p>

No. For no human law can separate what God has
joined together. Even after a civil divorce the two
parties are united by the bonds of matrimony, and if one
or the other re-marries, in the eyes of God and the Church
this new union is simply concubinage.<p>

<center>(J)</center><p>

<i>If one of the parties die may the surviving one re-marry?</i><p>

Yes; this is permitted although, in itself, the state of
remaining unmarried is more honourable. But in the
case of re-marriage, the woman who has already received
once the solemn nuptial blessing may not receive it
again (LXIII.; Code, Canons 5142, 1143).<p>

<center>(K)</center><p>

<i>What are solemn espousals which are celebrated before marriage?</i><p>

They consist essentially in the promise made by two
<!--
294 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
aspiring to marriage to contract marriage with each other
at some future time. For them to be valid in conscience
and before the world it is necessary for this promise to be
made in writing and that it be signed by both parties,
and by the parish priest or the bishop of the place, or
at least by two witnesses. If one does not know how to
write or is unable to do so, the fact must be mentioned
in the document and another witness brought forward
as testimony thereof (XLIII. 1; Code, Canon 1017).<p>

<i>Do espousals or an engagement to marry give the right to the use of marriage before the marriage is celebrated?</i><p>

No. Those fianc&eacute;s who act thus, apart from the fact
that they commit a mortal sin, arouse the anger of God,
who, later on, may. make them pay dearly for the abuse
of the holiness of their espousals.<p>

<hr><p>
XLIV. OF THE INTERMEDIARY STATE OF THOSE SOULS WHO AFTER DEATH ARE
AWAITING THE DAY OF THE LAST RESURRECTION; AND OF PURGATORY<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>To what end does Jesus Christ, who conquered sin and death by His Blood, lead the human race?</i><p>

He leads it to that end which is life eternal in the
glory of heaven through all eternity.<p>

<i>Are men given this immortal life in heaven immediately by the action of the redeeming power of Jesus Christ?</i><p>

No; for although Christ's sacred humanity and the
power of the sacraments could bring human nature immediately 
to this life of glory, it is fitting according to the
divine wisdom that human nature should run the course
of its evolution. Hence all those who have received
baptism and participate in the sacraments of Jesus
Christ, even after their personal sanctification is accomplished, 
have to remain in this life subject to its penalties,
and to the worst of all, which is death (LXIX. 1).
<!--
295 OF PURGATORY
--><p>

<i>It is then only at the end of human generations that death will be definitely conquered, and that men who were bought by the Blood of Jesus Christ will be fully compensated by the glory of both their body and soul in heaven?</i><p>

Yes, only then will they receive their full compensation;
and in the meantime they are in an intermediary state.<p>

<i>What is meant by this intermediary state?</i><p>

By this is meant that they do not receive immediately
the recompense of their meritorious life. All will receive
either recompense or chastisement, as the case may be,
in its fulness on the day of the resurrection, and whatever
it be it will endure for all eternity (LXIX. 2).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What is that intermediate state of those souls that cannot receive the reward of their meritorious life owing to some obstacle?</i><p>

It is called purgatory (LXXI. 6; Appendix, II.).<p>

<i>What souls are in purgatory?</i><p>

The souls of the just who die in a state of grace, but
who at the moment of death have not given satisfaction
to God for the temporal punishment due to sin (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>Purgatory then is a place of expiation where one must satisfy the justice of God before being admitted to the reward of heaven?</i><p>

Yes; and there could be nothing more in harmony
with the mercy and justice of God (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>How is the mercy of God shown in the expiation of purgatory?</i><p>

Because even after their death God gives the just the
means of satisfying His justice. God's mercy is also shown
by the communion of saints in that He permits the living to
offer up in the form of suffrages their own prayers, good
works, and penances for the benefit of the souls in purgatory.<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>What is the best offering that can be made to God on behalf of the souls in purgatory?</i><p>

The offering of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass.
<!--
296 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>Is it important that he who offers up some good work for the souls in purgatory should do so with the greatest possible fervour?</i><p>

Yes; for although God without doubt takes into account
the worth of what is offered to Him in expiation -- and
in the oblation of the sacrifice of the Mass this worth is
infinite -- He takes into greater account the fervour of
him who offers it; whether he himself offer it up as does
the priest, or whether he offer it through the ministry
of another, as when the faithful ask the priest to offer up
the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass in their name and for their
intention (LXXI. 9; Third Part, LXXIX. 5).<p>

<i>These offerings to God in expiation, whether offered for the souls in purgatory in general, or for a particular group, or for this or that soul in particular, are they applied by God according to the intention of him who makes the offering?</i><p>

Yes (LXXI. 6).<p>

<i>Are the indulgences that one gains (such as are applicable to the souls in purgatory) also applied according to the intention of him who offers them?</i><p>

Yes, all depends upon the intention of him who gains
them in conformity to the intention of the Church, who
fixes the limits of such offering (LXXI. 6; Code,
Canon 930).<p>

<i>As soon as sufficient satisfaction has been offered to God for their past sins, are the souls which were detained in purgatory for this end immediately received into heaven?</i><p>

Yes, they are received into heaven as soon as the
satisfaction for past sin is completed (LXIX. 2; 
Appendix, II. 6).<p>

<hr><p>
XLV. OF HEAVEN<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>What is heaven?</i><p>

It is that place where the holy angels have lived since the
beginning of the world and to which are admitted all the
<!--
OF HEAVEN 297
-->
just who have been redeemed by the Blood of Jesus Christ
since the day of His glorious Ascension.<p>

<i>What is necessary for the just to be admitted into heaven?</i><p>

They must have reached the term of their mortal life,
and must have no debt to pay to the justice of God
(LXIX. 2).<p>

<i>Are any souls of the just admitted into heaven immediately after their death?</i><p>

Yes; they are those souls who have received in their
full effect the application of the merits of Jesus Christ; or
who, whilst on earth, in union with the satisfaction of
Jesus Christ have offered to God full satisfaction due
to their sins (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>Children that die after having received baptism and before they have come to the age when they would be capable of sinning, are they admitted immediately to heaven?</i><p>

Yes, because original sin, which for them was the
only obstacle, has been washed away by baptism.<p>

<i>Is the case the same as regards those adults who, although they have committed mortal sins, receive baptism in good dispositions and die immediately afterwards or before they commit sin again?</i><p>

Yes, because the sacrament of Baptism applies in all
their fulness the merits of the Passion of Jesus Christ
(Third Part, LXIX. 1, 2, 7, 8).<p>

<i>And those who having committed sins, even mortal, since their baptism, and who have not made complete satisfaction for them, but who nevertheless at the moment of dying offer their life to God by a perfect act of charity, are they received into heaven immediately after their death?</i><p>

Yes; especially when this perfect act of charity is
martyrdom (Second Part: Second Section, CXXIV. 3).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What happens to the souls of the just as soon as they enter heaven?</i><p>

They immediately behold the vision of God which
renders them supremely happy (First Part, XII. 11).
<!--
298 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>Is it by their own power that they can thus see God, or must they receive some new perfection which strengthens their power of vision?</i><p>

It is necessary for them to receive a further supernatural 
perfection other than grace, virtues, and gifts
which they already possess (<i>ibid.</i> XII. 5).<p>

<i>What is this ulterior perfection called?</i><p>

It is called the Light of Glory (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>What is meant by this?</i><p>

It is a quality infused by God into the mind of the
blessed which strengthens and elevates it, making it
capable of receiving within it as the principle of its act
of vision the Divine Essence itself in all its splendour
(<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>What results from this union of the Divine Essence with the mind of the blessed?</i><p>

The result is that the blessed see God as He sees
Himself (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>Is this the vision that is called Face to Face?</i><p>

Yes, such as is promised us in the Holy Scriptures;
and such as makes us like to God as far as it is possible
for a creature to be.<p>

<i>Is it in order to communicate this vision to the blessed that God created all things, and rules and guides them all, from the beginning to the end of the world?</i><p>

Yes. Moreover, when all the places He has marked
in heaven shall be filled the actual course of the world
will come to an end; and He will re-establish this world
in a new state which will be that of the resurrection.<p>

<i>Can we know when the end of the world will come?</i><p>

No; this depends entirely upon the counsels and
providence of God.<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Do the happy elect who enjoy the beatific vision take any interest at all in the things that take place on earth and among human beings?</i><p>

Most certainly they interest themselves with things
that happen on earth.
<!--
OF HELL 299
--><p>

<i>Do the elect in heaven see all that passes on earth?</i><p>

They see in the vision of God all that in this world
refers to the mystery of God's predestination and its
fulfilment.<p>

<i>Do they hear the prayers addressed to them, and do they know the spiritual and temporal needs of those who were dear to them on earth?</i><p>

Most assuredly; and they are always answering these
prayers, and provide for the wants of those on earth by
interceding to God (LXXII. 1).<p>

<i>Why then do we not always feel the benefit of their intercession?</i><p>

Because they see our bequests and needs in the light
of God, in which that which oftentimes seems a good
to us is not in reality so according to the ordering of the
divine providence (LXXII. 3).<p>

<hr><p>
XLVI. OF HELL<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Is there a place of eternal damnation?</i><p>

Yes, and it is called hell (LXIX. 2).<p>

<i>What is hell?</i><p>

Hell is a place of torments to which are condemned
all those who by their sins have revolted against God,
and have remained in their sins.<p>

<i>Who are these?</i><p>

Among the angels all those that sinned; and among
men those that die in the state of final impenitence
(LXIX. 2).<p>

<i>Since the damned are rooted in evil in such wise that they never repent what is the consequence?</i><p>

The consequence is that the torments which they have
merited by their sins will last for ever.<p>

<i>But could God not put an end to these torments?</i><p>

Yes, He could do so by His absolute power; but
according to the order of His wisdom He will not do so,
for according to this order those who arrive at the term
<!--
300 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA TFIEOLOGICA"
-->
of their life are fixed for always either in good or in evil,
and since the evil always remains so must the punishment 
always remain (XCIX. 1, 2).<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What are the torments that the damned will suffer always?</i><p>

They are twofold: the pain of loss and the pain of
sense (XCVII. 1, 2).<p>

<i>What is the pain of loss?</i><p>

It is the privation of the infinite good which is the
beatific vision in heaven.<p>

<i>Whence is it that this punishment will be cruelly felt by the damned?</i><p>

It arises from this, that having arrived at the term of their
life they see the nothingness of all the things they sought
in life to the prejudice of the infinite good; they will
then appreciate the greatness of the good they have lost,
and they will realize that they lost it through their own
fault entirely.<p>

<i>Is not this perpetual consciousness of having lost so great a good as the vision of God called by the Gospel "the worm that never dies"?</i><p>

Yes; and this will be the most terrible punishment
of their guilty conscience (XCVII. 2).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Must one understand in a metaphorical and purely spiritual sense the other punishment of which the Gospel speaks and which it calls "the fire that never dies"?</i><p>

No; one must understand these words of material
fire; for they signify the pain of sense (XCVII. 5).<p>

<i>But how can material fire act upon spirits or upon souls separated from the body?</i><p>

By a special ordering of His justice, God communicates
to this material fire the preternatural power of serving as
an instrument of His justice (LXX. 3).
<!--
OF THE JUDGMENT 301
--><p>

<i>Will all the damned be tormented by the fire of hell in the same way?</i><p>

No, for since it is used as an instrument of the divine
justice, its action will be proportioned to the nature,
number, and gravity of the sins committed by each one
(XCVII. 5, <i>Obj.</i> 3).<p>

<hr><p>
XLVII. OF THE JUDGMENT WHEREBY A SOUL IS SENT 
TO PURGATORY, HEAVEN, OR HELL<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>By what act is a soul sent to purgatory, heaven, or hell?</i><p>

By the act of judgment.<p>

<i>What is this judgment?</i><p>

It is that act of the justice of God which pronounces
definitely on the state of a soul with regard to its reward
or punishment.<p>

<i>When does this judgment take place?</i><p>

It takes place immediately after death as soon as the
soul is separated from the body.<p>

<i>Who makes this judgment?</i><p>

It is made by God Himself; and after the Ascension
of Jesus Christ to heaven it is made through the sacred
humanity of the Word made flesh.<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>Does the soul that is judged see God or the sacred humanity of Jesus Christ?</i><p>

God is not seen in His essence, nor is the sacred
humanity of Jesus Christ seen who is in heaven, except
by those souls who according to a judgment in their favour
immediately enter heaven.<p>

<i>In what way does the judgment take place of the other souls?</i><p>

There is as it were a light whereby they see instantaneously 
the whole course of their life, and which shows
<!--
302 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
them immediately the place to which they are allotted
whether in hell or in purgatory.<p>

<i>It is then as it were in the same instant that the soul, as soon as it leaves the body, is judged and its place allotted to it in purgatory, hell, or heaven?</i><p>

Yes, since all this takes place by the almighty power
of God, whose action is instantaneous.<p>

<i>Can sometimes the very last act of man, before the soul leaves the body, decide the fate of the soul for all eternity. and guarantee for the soul eternal happiness?</i><p>

Yes, but this comes about sometimes only by the great
mercy of God; and it may be that there were other acts
during man's life which in some way prepared him for
this great grace, or by reason of the prayers of saintly
souls who inclined God to perform this act of supreme
mercy.<p>

<hr><p>
XLVIII. OF THE PLACE OF THOSE WHO ARE
NOT JUDGED, VIZ., OF THE LIMBO OF INFANTS<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Are there any human beings who at the moment of death are not judged?</i><p>

Yes. All children who die before attaining the age of
reason, or those who though adults never had the use of
reason (LXIX. 6).<p>

<i>Is there any allotment at all as regards infants and those who have not had the use of reason?</i><p>

Yes, but this is not by reason of their merits or demerits;
and it is not made by way of judgment. It comes about
by the fact that some have received baptism and others
have not. Those that have received baptism immediately 
go to heaven; whereas those who have not received
this sacrament go to a place reserved for them which is
called Limbo.
<!--
OF THE LIMBO OF INFANTS 303
--><p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>Is Limbo distinct from Purgatory and hell?</i><p>

Yes, because these two latter are places where punishment 
is inflicted for personal sins (LXIX. 6).<p>

<i>Do infants who have died without baptism suffer the pain of loss in Limbo?</i><p>

Yes, to a certain degree, for they know they are deprived
of the vision of God; but this has not the character of
torture such as those in hell suffer (Appendix, 1. 2).<p>

<i>Whence arises this difference as regards the pain of loss?</i><p>

It comes from this, that although they know they are
deprived of the vision of God, they also know that this
is not by reason of any personal sin but by reason of their
being born of Adam, who sinned (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>For them, then, there is no horrible worm that gnaws their souls such as torments the damned in hell?</i><p>

No. But they live in a state without any kind of
suffering or sadness, except that they are conscious of that
supreme happiness which would have been theirs had
the merits of the redemption been applied to them and
which they will never have, not by any fault on their
part but because the inscrutable counsels of God have
arranged it so (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>Do the souls of these infants know the mysteries of the redemption?</i><p>

Most certainly.<p>

<i>Have they the light of faith?</i><p>

No, they have not faith in the sense of that interior
supernatural light perfecting the mind whereby in a
certain intimate manner it penetrates revealed mysteries
and generates in the soul a strong desire towards them;
they know these mysteries very much in the same way
as those who cannot help but assent to the truth of the
divine mysteries revealed by God, but who are not drawn
by an impulse of grace to cling supernaturally to these
mysteries, and as a consequence they do not penetrate
the intimate meaning of them.

<i>Besides this Limbo of the souls of children who die before baptism, is not mention made of another Limbo in the language of the Church?</i><p>

Yes, it is that Limbo where formerly the just were
detained, that is, those in whom there was no personal
hindrance as regards entrance into heaven, but who had
to await the coming of the Redeemer (LXIX. 7).<p>

<i>Is there anyone now in this Limbo of the just?</i><p>

Since the day when Jesus Christ at the moment of His
death descended there and left it on the day of His
Resurrection, bringing with Him all the souls of the
just, this place ceased to be occupied by those for whom
it was primarily destined; but it may be that since then
it is the place where children go who die without baptism,
so in this case it would be the same as the Limbo of
infants.<p>

XLIX. OF THE END OF THE WORLD AND THE SEQUEL THEREOF<p>

<i>In what will the end of the world consist, and what will follow upon it?</i><p>

The end of the world will be immediately followed by
two great events, viz., the resurrection and the judgment.
Moreover, the Apostle St. Peter teaches us that the
end of the world will be by fire at the moment when
Jesus Christ shall come in His glory to judge the living
and the dead (LXXIV. 1, 2).<p>

<i>Will this universal conflagration which will destroy the present world be as it were a preparation for the judgment?</i><p>

Yes, by purifying all things and making them worthy
of the new state so as to be in harmony with the glory of
the elect (LXXIV. 1).<p>

<i>Will this final conflagration act by its own virtue, or also as instrument of the divine power?</i><p>

It will act also as an instrument of God in particular
<!--
OF THE RESURRECTION 305
-->
for the purification of those souls which would have
perhaps remained in the flames of purgatory for a long
time (LXXIV. 3-8).<p>

<i>These souls then will be purified and made worthy to be admitted among the elect as it were instantaneously?</i><p>

Yes; and the purifying virtue of this fire will be 
proportioned by God to the degree of expiation necessary in
each case.<p>

<i>Do we know when this conflagration will take place?</i><p>

No; but it will be preceded by certain signs which
will herald the near advent of the Sovereign Judge.<p>

<i>What will these signs be?</i><p>

There will be unheard-of upheavals in the whole of
nature which, as the Gospel says, will make men quake
with fear.<p>

<hr><p>
L. OF THE RESURRECTION<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>What will happen immediately after the great conflagration?</i><p>

There will be heard an order, a voice, the sound of a
trumpet, so speaks St. Paul in his First Epistle to the
Thessalonians, which will awaken the dead from their
tombs, and command all men to stand before the Judge
of the living and the dead; and this Judge will descend
from heaven in all the glory of His majesty (LXXV. 1).<p>

<i>Which are those who will come to life at this moment?</i><p>

All those who were already dead; and also all those
who are still living when Jesus Christ appears.<p>

<i>But how can these last also rise from the dead?</i><p>

In this wise: if all comes to be as it were instantaneously 
as St. Paul seems to say (1 Cor., chap. xv., ver. 51),
by the power of God all those human beings who are
living will die an instantaneous death, and will rise again
immediately in the state which they have merited and
which will be theirs for all eternity (LXXVIII. 1, 2).
<!--
306 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>Will the bodies of all the just who rise from the dead be instantaneously transformed and become glorious?</i><p>

Yes.<p>

<i>But will these bodies now resplendent with glory be the same bodies that the just had when they lived this life?</i><p>

Yes, they will be the same bodies with this difference,
that there will be no imperfections or troubles or sicknesses
such as they were subject to on earth; on the contrary,
these bodies will have perfections that will in some sense
spiritualise them (LXXIX.-LXXXI.).<p>

<i>How can all this come about?</i><p>

By the almighty power of God, who having created all
things can change and transform them as He wills.<p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What are these new perfections or properties of the glorified risen body?</i><p>

They are impassibility, subtlety, agility, and clarity.<p>

<i>What is impassibility?</i><p>

It is that property of the glorified body whereby the
soul has perfect dominion over the body in such wise
that no defect and no suffering or sickness whatsoever
can be in the body (LXXXII. 1).<p>

<i>Will this impassibility be the same in all?</i><p>

Yes, in the sense that there can be no defect in the body
which is perfectly under the dominion of the soul; but
the power of this dominion will be proportioned to the
glory of the soul, which will be different according to
the degree in which the soul participates in the beatific
vision (LXXXII. 2).<p>

<i>Will it follow from this impassibility that the glorified body will be devoid of sensibility?</i><p>

In no wise; it will have, on the contrary, a sensibility
that is exquisite in the highest possible degree, with no
admixture whatsoever of imperfection. Hence the eye
of the glorified body will see in an incomparable degree
more readily and more piercingly than in this life; the ear
<!--
OF THE RESURRECTION 307
-->
will have a sensitiveness without compare. So with all
the other senses; each will attain its object with an
intensity of perfection impossible for us now to imagine,
and this without an object ever injuring the sense as so
often happens in this life (LXXXII. 3, 4).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>What is the property of subtlety in a glorified body?</i><p>

Subtlety will consist in a superlative perfection of the
body due to the influence of the glorified soul; this
influence will impart to the body something so pure and
ethereal that it will cease to have that heaviness or density
that it has now on earth; but this property in no way
detracts from the true nature of the body as though it
thereby becomes unreal, aeriform, or a phantom.<p>

<i>Will a glorified body on account of its subtlety be able to occupy the same place as another body? and is it itself independent of all place, or does it occupy space?</i><p>

The glorified body cannot occupy the same place as
another body, for it retains always its own dimensions or
quantity, and consequently it will always be in a place
and in space (LXXXIII. 2).<p>

<i>It was not then by reason of the property of subtlety that the risen Body of our Lord passed through closed doors?</i><p>

No, this was a miracle and was performed by the
divine power of Jesus Christ; in the same way it was by
the divine power that our Lord was born without prejudicing 
the virginity of Mary His Mother (LXXXIII. 2, <i>Obj.</i> 1).<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>What is the property of agility in the glorified body?</i><p>

It is a certain perfection in the body derived from the
glorified soul whereby the body will obey in the most
marvellously ready manner all the movements of the soul
which is its motive principle (LXXXIV. 1).<p>

<i>Will the saints make use of this property?</i><p>

They will most certainly use it when they have to come
<!--
308 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
-->
to the judgment of Jesus Christ on the last day, and when
they ascend to heaven with Him. It is also probable
they will use this gift according as they will in order to
manifest the divine wisdom in conferring this gift upon
them; and also in order to appreciate better the beauty
of all things in the universe in which the wisdom of God
will shine forth (LXXXIV. 2).<p>

<i>Will the bodies of the saints be moved instantaneously by virtue of agility?</i><p>

No; their movements will always require duration in
time, except that so rapid will be their movement that
this duration will be imperceptible (LXXXI V. 3).<p>

<center>(E)</center><p>

<i>What is the fourth property which is called clarity?</i><p>

By this is meant that the splendour of the soul will
shine as it were through the body, so that the body will be
as it were luminous and transparent; but this will not
detract from the natural colour of the body, but will
rather harmonize with it, imparting to it the most exquisite
beauty (LXXXV. 1).<p>

<i>Will this clarity be the same in all?</i><p>

No, it will be proportioned to the degree of glory
proper to each soul; and for this reason St. Paul speaks of
a variety among the glorified bodies: "One is the glory
of the sun, another of the moon, and another the glory
of the stars. For star differeth from star in glory"
(First Epistle to Cor., chap. xv., ver. 41).<p>

<i>Will it be possible for the eye of a non-glorified body to see this clarity of the glorified body?</i><p>

Yes; and the lost will perceive it in all its splendour
(LXXXV. 2).<p>

<i>Will it be in the power of the soul to permit or not to permit this clarity of its glorified body to be seen?</i><p>

Yes, for this clarity comes entirely from the soul and is
entirely subject to it (LXXXV. 3).
<!--
OF THE LAST JUDGMENT 309
--><p>

<center>(F)</center><p>

<i>In what state or at what age will the bodies of the blessed rise?</i><p>

They will all rise at that age in which human nature
is in its most perfect state of development (LXXXI. 1).<p>

<i>Will it be the same as regards the bodies of the damned?</i><p>

Yes, except that they will have none of the four qualities
of the glorified body (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>Does it follow that the bodies of the damned will be corruptible?</i><p>

In no wise, for corruptibility and death will be no more
(LXXXVI. 2).<p>

<i>They will then be at the same time passible and immortal?</i><p>

Yes, God has so arranged in His justice and power
that the bodies of the damned will never corrupt or be
destroyed, and yet all things, especially the fire of hell,
will be for them a cause of suffering and torture
(LXXXVI. 2, 3).<p>

<center>(G)</center><p>

<i>As regards children that die without baptism what will the state of their bodies be?</i><p>

They will rise in the most perfect state of a human being
in nature, but without the properties of the glorified
body; but they will never suffer any sorrow or pain
(cf. Appendix, I. a).<p>

<hr><p>
LI. OF THE LAST JUDGMENT<p>

<i>As soon as men rise from the dead will they immediately be in presence of the Sovereign Judge?</i><p>

Yes (LXXXIX. 5).<p>

<i>Under what form will the Sovereign Judge appear at the moment of judgment?</i><p>

He will appear under the form of His sacred humanity
in all the glory which is due to His union with the Person
of the Word (XC. 1, 2).
<!--
310 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>Will all men see this glory of the Sovereign Judge?</i><p>

Yes (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>Will all see Him in the glory of His divine nature?</i><p>

No, only the elect whose souls enjoy the beatific vision
will see this glory (XC. 3).<p>

<i>Will all men who appear be judged?</i><p>

No, only those who have had the use of reason during
this life; but they will be present that they may behold
the sovereign justice of the judgments of God and the
glory of Jesus Christ (LXXXIX. 5, <i>Obj.</i> 3).<p>

<i>Will all men who have had the use of reason be judged?</i><p>

They will all be judged as regards the separation which
will take place between the good and the bad. The good
will be placed on the right hand of the Judge to hear His
sentence of benediction; and the bad on His left hand
to receive His sentence of malediction. But the good
will not be judged in the sense that their bad acts, if any,
will be judged before all heaven and earth; in this sense
only the lost will be judged (LXXXIX. 6, 7).<p>

<i>Will this convincing of sin in the face of all bring confusion to the lost?</i><p>

Yes, it will be inexpressible torture for them, because
behind every sin, especially mortal sin, there is hidden
pride; and on the day of judgment they will be forced
to confess all before the Sovereign Judge, who will leave
nothing hidden.<p>

<i>Will all the evil done by the lost during life be brought to light before all present?</i><p>

Yes, whatever evil it be it will be brought to light: all
that was committed in their individual and private life,
or in the family or in the society (LXXXVII. 1, 2, 3).<p>

<i>In what way will this manifestation of an entire life take place?</i><p>

In the same way as in the particular judgment when by
a light the whole of one's life is instantaneously present,
so in the general judgment all consciences will be laid
bare to the gaze of all instantaneously (<i>ibid.</i>).
<!--
311 OF ETERNAL PUNISHMENT
--><p>

<i>Will the consciences of the just and all their life also be made manifest to all?</i><p>

Yes, but this will be a triumph for their humility in
life (LXXXIX. 6).<p>

<i>Will all the sins one has committed during life, but for which penance has been done, be also made manifest?</i><p>

Yes, but this will be to the glory of the just by reason
of their penance (LXXXVII. 2, <i>Obj.</i> 3).<p>

<i>Will there be certain of the just who will also assist at the last judgment in the capacity of judges?</i><p>

Yes; all those who after the example of the Apostles
left all to give themselves up entirely to God, and whose
life has been in some sort a proclamation of the Gospel
in its perfection (LXXXIX. 1, 2).<p>

<i>Will the angels also be judges on the last day?</i><p>

No, because those who help Jesus Christ to judge must
resemble Him; but it is as man that the Son of God will
exercise the function of Sovereign Judge (LXXXIX. 7).<p>

<i>Will the angels be judged on the last day?</i><p>

No, except that the good angels who have helped in
the actions of the just, and the bad angels in the actions of
the wicked, will receive an increase of happiness or of
punishment respectively (LXXXIX. 3).<p>

<i>What will be the ending of the last judgment?</i><p>

To those on His right Jesus Christ will say: "Come,
ye blessed of My Father, and possess the Kingdom 
prepared for you from the constitution of the world."
To those on His left He will say: "Depart from Me, ye
accursed, into hell fire, which was prepared for the devil
and his angels."<p>

<hr><p>
LII. OF ETERNAL PUNISHMENT<p>

<i>Will the sentence of the Sovereign Judge with regard to the lost be carried out by the demons?</i><p>

Yes; the lost will immediately be seized by the demons
and dragged to hell, where in addition to their own sufferings 
they will be tormented for ever by the demons
(LXXXIX. 4).
<!--
312 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>Will the fact that the lost have now their bodies be a new cause of suffering?</i><p>

Yes, for henceforth they will suffer not only in their soul
but also in their body; but the suffering of the body will
not be the same for all, for the punishment will be 
proportionate to the number and gravity of sins committed
by each one (XCVII. 1, 5).<p>

<i>Will the sufferings of the lost ever cease or become less intense?</i><p>

No, because their will is fixed in evil, and hence they
will always be in the same state of wickedness (XCVIII.
1, 2; XCIX. 1).<p>

<hr><p>
LIII. OF ETERNAL HAPPINESS<p>

<center>(A)</center><p>

<i>Will the elect immediately enter heaven after their sentence has been pronounced?</i><p>

Yes.<p>

<i>Will the happiness of the elect be increased by the fact that their bodies are now united to their souls?</i><p>

Yes, they will have an increase of accidental happiness,
their essential happiness consisting in the vision of God
(XCIII. 1).<p>

<i>Will there be distinct places for the elect in heaven?</i><p>

Yes, for the degree of charity or of grace will determine
the degree of glory (XCIII. 2, 3).<p>

<i>In this assembly of the elect will men have something that the angels will not have?</i><p>

Yes, for men will form the Church triumphant, but
the angels will not have the same relation to Jesus Christ,
who is the King of the Church triumphant (XCV. 1, 2, 4).<p>

<i>In what will this difference consist?</i><p>

In this, that the elect belonging to the human race
resemble Jesus Christ, who has the same human nature;
but this will never be so with the angels. The elect
therefore will have certain intimate relations with Jesus
Christ which the angels have not.
<!--
OF ETERNAL HAPPINESS 313
--><p>

<center>(B)</center><p>

<i>What will be the result of this intimate relation between the Church triumphant and Jesus Christ?</i><p>

The result will be that on its entrance into heaven
Almighty God will bestow upon it the most inestimable
gifts which are called the dowry of the blessed (XCV. 1).<p>

<i>What is this dowry?</i><p>

It is threefold in the glorified soul from which it is
reflected, as it were, in the body under the form of the four
properties whereby the body is glorified (of these latter
we have already spoken); this dowry will consist in the
vision, possession, and fruition of the divine essence
(XCV. 5).<p>

<center>(C)</center><p>

<i>May one say that the elect in heaven will be invested, as it were, with a royal dignity?</i><p>

Yes, because the beatific vision unites them to God, and
thus they participate in the divinity of God; and since
God is the immortal King of ages, the elect participate
in this sovereign royalty and its glory (XCVI. 1).<p>

<i>Is it then by reason of this that the blessed are said to receive a crown in heaven?</i><p>

Yes, it is for this precisely (XCVI. 1).<p>

<center>(D)</center><p>

<i>Do the blessed also have what is called an aureola?</i><p>

Yes; but although the crown is common to all, only
certain ones will have an aureola (XCVI. 1).<p>

<i>What is the reason of this difference?</i><p>

It comes to this: the crown is the result or the resplendency 
of essential happiness which consists in the vision
of God; whereas an aureola is a resplendency of an accidental 
order caused by the joy of certain of the elect on
account of certain works they performed while on earth
which were specially meritorious (XCVI. 1).
<!--
314 CATECHISM OF THE "SUMMA THEOLOGICA"
--><p>

<i>Will the angels have aureolas?</i><p>

No, for they had no such meritorious works to 
accomplish (XCVI. 9).<p>

<i>What kind of meritorious works did certain of the elect perform which gives them the right to an aureola?</i><p>

Some were martyrs, others virgins, and others preached
the Gospel (XCVI. 5, 6, 7).<p>

<i>Why will these three kinds of good works merit an aureola?</i><p>

Because they make men resemble Jesus Christ in a
special way in so far as He was victorious over the flesh,
the world, and the devil (<i>ibid.</i>).<p>

<i>Are there not in the Sacred Scriptures words which concern the eternal happiness of the elect in heaven?</i><p>

Yes, in the Apocalypse of St. John, chap. xxii., ver. 5,
we read these words: "Night shall be no more: and they
shall not need the light of the lamp, nor the light of the sun,
because the Lord God shall enlighten them, and they
shall reign for ever and ever."<p>

O JESUS, most sweet Son of the glorious Virgin Mary,
and the only-begotten of the living God; together with
Thy Father, who begot Thee from all eternity in the
womb of His infinite nature, and who communicates
to Thee this same infinite nature; and with the Holy
Ghost, who proceeds from the Father and from Thee,
who is Thy Father's Spirit and Thine, who is Thy
Father's subsisting Love and Thine, and who received
from you both the same infinite nature;<p>

I adore Thee and I acknowledge Thee as my God,
the only true God, one and infinitely perfect;<p>

Who created all things out of nothing, and who 
maintains and governs them with infinite wisdom, with
sovereign goodness and with almighty power;<p>

I beg Thee, in virtue of the mysteries of Thy sacred
humanity, to cleanse me in Thy Blood and wash away
all my sins; I beg Thee to impart to me Thy Holy
Spirit with an abundance of His grace, His virtues, and
His gifts;<p>

I beg Thee to make me believe in Thee, to hope in
Thee, and to love Thee, that by each one of my acts I
may strive to merit Thee, who hast promised one day
to give Thyself to me in all the splendour of Thy glory
in the presence of Thy holy angels and saints. Amen.<p>
