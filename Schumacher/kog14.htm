<h2>BIOGRAPHICAL.</h2><p>

Matthew A. Schumacher was born March 8, 1879, in Chicago, Illinois. Pursued his primary studies at St. Mary's Parochial School, South Bend, Indiana. Entered the University of Notre Dame in 1892, where he received an A. B. in 1899. Entered Holy Cross College, in 1900, and at the same time took up studies at the Catholic University of America. These studies centred especially around Philosophy, Psychology, and Apologetics. Thanks are due to Dr. E. A. Pace, for suggestion and stimulation, during the whole course of Philosophy; also to Dr. Aiken, Professor of Apologetics.
