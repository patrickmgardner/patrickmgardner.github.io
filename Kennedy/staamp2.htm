<hr><H1>Dangers and Abuses of Scholasticism -- Abelard (1079-1142)</h1>

There are shades and shadows, as well as bright and beautiful colors, 
in every good painting.  This chapter will show some of the shadows in 
the picture of Scholasticism.  The zest for learning, the new spirit, 
the new impulse and enthusiasm for philosophical studies, which 
animated the scholars of the Middle Ages, became dangerous when they 
were not carefully directed and moderated by sound principles.  Errors 
crept in where the truth was sought by men who were easily puffed up 
with vain knowledge, and forgot to keep their eyes fixed on the 
guiding-star of Divine revelation.<p>

One-sided representations are never fair or satisfactory.  On the other 
hand, as the shades and shadows in a painting set forth the beautiful 
and brighter coloring, so also the wanderings, the faults, and the 
strange theories of erring Scholastics, give greater prominence to the 
learning, piety, and enlightened faith of the orthodox scholars.  It is 
necessary that scandals should come, and woe unto them by whom they are 
caused! -- but we know that God permits evils that greater good may be 
accomplished, and His power is so great, as St. Augustine remarks, that 
He can always direct evil results in such a manner that they will serve 
the accomplishment of some good purpose.<p>

<A NAME="Histo"><b>History not Feared.</b></a> -- Catholics do not fear 
a full and complete account of the errors into which some Scholastics 
were led, because the history of those errors proves three things which 
they gladly record: (1) That there existed in those ages called "dark" 
a strong desire for learning and for the diffusion of knowledge; (2) 
that reason has limits beyond which it must not venture, and that pride 
dazzles and blinds the cultivated intellect which humility might have 
guided in the path of light and truth; (3) that Providence watches and 
rules over the Church for when errors appeared the champions of the 
Faith were multiplied; and such champions were they that impartial 
historians are unanimous in giving them the verdict of superiority over 
the brilliant but erring brethren whom they opposed.<p> 

Any good qualities or perfections, challenging our admiration, that 
appear in those who indulged in foolish subtleties or gave themselves 
up to sophistical and rationalistic tendencies which marked the rise of 
Scholasticism, are to be found in all their excellence and abundance in 
the more serious philosophers and theologians, the great Scholastics.  
They knew how to use the new system without being dazed and misled by 
foolish theories and dangerous opinions which tried to find shelter 
under the name of Philosophy.<p>

The great Doctors of those days knew that malice and prejudice would 
misconstrue their opposition to error, claiming -- as the malicious of 
all times claim -- that they were opposing knowledge and science.  
Their task was difficult and delicate, but so well did they accomplish 
it that we do not fear to make known the misfortunes and calamities of 
Scholasticism as well as its triumphs, because this knowledge will 
certainly lead to the conclusion: The great Scholastics opposed error 
in every form, but they loved the truth, and their writings furnish a 
standing proof of the fact that faith does not prevent the free and 
full exercise of reason within the limits of its own territory.  What 
those limits are we now know, or ought to know.  The dividing lines 
were not so clearly marked in the ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth 
centuries, and it is not surprising that some of the first travellers 
in the new fields went beyond the boundaries.<p>

<A NAME="First"><b>First Mistakes.</b></a> -- The first mistakes of the 
Scholastics were innocent and harmless -- one might say, childish.  
Later errors were more serious, and endangered the faith, although, as 
we shall see, even in their strangest vagaries, they did not 
persistently and contumaciously defend errors after they were 
condemned, in which they differ essentially from out-and-out 
heretics.<p> 

The first Scholastics did not know for a long time what use should be 
made of the new branches of learning that were introduced into the 
schools, and they sought in learning amusement or pleasure rather than 
real advancement.  In order to understand the condition of their minds 
it must be remembered that the influence of Charlemagne, and the 
patronage of all princes who desired to be considered wise and great, 
had created an extraordinary enthusiasm for learning.<p>

The profession of Master was a title of admission to the courts of 
princes, and opened the gates to all honors and distinctions.  
Students, or scholars, were everywhere respected and were regarded as a 
privileged class.  They were protected by special laws, and even the 
poorest peasants esteemed the honor of giving hospitality to poor 
students, journeying from the provinces to Paris, which soon became the 
great centre of learning.<p>

The <i>Trivium</i> and the <i>Quadrivium</i> were still taught in the 
schools, but men were no longer content with the seven liberal arts; 
something more was required.  The great Masters, such as Alcuin and 
Rabanus Maurus, began to write philosophical treatises, and in a short 
time both masters and pupils were fired with the ambition to become 
philosophers.  This enthusiasm for philosophy continued to increase 
until it became a veritable craze, and a cry was raised against the new 
method by those who saw in it a disregard for the advice of St. Paul 
against "philosophy and vain deceit."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n13">[13]</a>  Their objections were not altogether 
groundless, because many scholars neglected the study of the Fathers 
and of the Sacred Scriptures to devote themselves to philosophy.  The 
art of reasoning was regarded as the most important branch of learning; 
the most expert disputants were considered the greatest scholars, and 
woe be unto the reputation of the old professors, however learned and 
venerable they may have been, if they could not make a display of logic 
in proving the propositions which they advanced, and in answering 
objections.<p> 

<A NAME="Schol"><b>Scholastic Subtleties.</b></a> -- The Masters 
expounded their teachings in a series of propositions, which were spun 
out into useless and confusing distinctions and subdistinctions, and 
proved by a multiplicity of arguments which it was almost impossible to 
follow.<p> 

Sometimes, in order to give themselves an air of mystery and 
importance, they affected to imitate the epigrammatic style of 
Aristotle, and only the brighter students could detect the meaning of 
their words.  There was the same multiplication of distinctions in 
proposing and answering objections, and the same studied obscurity of 
language, which was considered necessary in order to sharpen the wits 
of the students.  "As two negatives are equal to an affirmative, 
professors were accustomed to introduce into their arguments such a 
number of negatives, that in order to reckon them up, and see in what 
sense their propositions were to be understood, the hearers had 
recourse to the device of dropping a bean at each negative, and 
reckoning up the sum total at the end of the lecture." <A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n14">[14]</a>  All this ingenuity -- logical 
pyrotechnics, it might be called -- was frequently wasted on questions 
that did not deserve the attention of serious men.<p> 

Following the example of their masters, the students devoted themselves 
to subtleties and distinctions, and to the discussion of silly 
questions, wrangling in the streets, and sometimes passing the whole 
day in arguments.  One of the arguments was this: Whether a pig that is 
driven to market by a man is held by the man, or by the cord fastened 
round the pig's leg!  Such foolish amusements furnished a pr../resource for 
the accusation that the Scholastics spent their time in debating such 
questions as this: Can ten thousand angels dance at once on the point 
of a needle?  "Foolish, but not dangerous," would be the verdict of a 
judge, if a Scholastic addicted to such methods and practices were 
brought before him under a decree <i>De lunatico inquirendo</i>.<p>

There was no danger to the faith from such foolish practices, but the 
system entailed a loss of valuable time, which might have been given to 
more profitable exercises; and it failed to accomplish the one purpose 
at which it aimed, viz., the training of the minds of scholars.  It 
must not be considered an essential part of Scholasticism; it was an 
unprofitable amusement, in which the first Scholastics lost much 
valuable time, and it was severly condemned by the Scholastics.<p>

St. Thomas Aquinas tells us that he wrote his "Summa Theologica" to be 
a manual suitable for students, "because," said he, "I have observed 
that beginners in this sacred science are very much impeded by the 
multiplication of useless questions, articles, and arguments."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n15">[15]</a>  After they had amused themselves for 
a time with the new weapon of attack and defence, men naturally turned 
to something more serious, and we might have had the perfection of the 
Scholastic system long before the middle of the thirteenth century, 
were it not that a few turbulent and unruly spirits appeared from time 
to time to delay the progress of true philosophical knowledge.<p> 

<A NAME="ABELA">ABELARD.</a> -- The most turbulent and unruly of all 
these disturbing spirits was the celebrated and unfortunate Peter 
Abelard.  We must not attach too much importance to the influence of 
this man.  He was undoubtedly a brilliant scholar, but he was not a 
deep thinker.  He was a meteor that shone for a while and dazzled men 
by its brilliancy, but he was not a sun giving light and warmth to the 
world.  There would never have been so much noise made about him were 
it not for two things: (1) The romance of his relations with 
Helo&iuml;se excited a volume of prurient curiosity and maudlin 
sentimentality which filled the world of literature with a number of 
silly and pernicious books which should never have been written; (2) he 
openly defended rationalistic principles, and thus has been regarded by 
modern Rationalists as the champion of free thought; and freedom is 
something that charms and blinds men, insomuch that many crimes have 
been committed under the cover of that name.<p> 

The romance of Abelard's career must be passed over in silence.  It is 
best to cover that chapter of history with a dark veil of mourning, so 
that those who wish to look upon it may know that they are to read a 
tale of shame and sorrow, both of which were keenly felt by the central 
characters in the romantic story.  Abelard could never have been a St. 
Thomas, because he had not the depth of thought, made still deeper by 
serious study which is necessarily required in a great philosopher or 
theologian.  He might have been a Christian Cicero, had he given 
himself to literature and eloquence, for he was undoubtedly talented, 
eloquent, and skilled in the use of words, which he poured forth in a 
silver stream that charmed and delighted his hearers.  Certainly he 
could have become a John of Salisbury, the friend of Thomas &agrave; 
Becket, who was considered the first scholar of his day, and who was a 
veritable "Junius" in the letters that he wrote against the 
logic-choppers, whom he designated "Cornificians," because their new 
methods caused a neglect of polite letters.  But a career that might 
have been useful as it was brilliant, was marred by pride and luxury, 
which, according to his own confession, were Abelard's dominant faults 
even before he came to Paris.<p> 

<A NAME="Forer"><b>Forerunners of Abelard.</b></a> -- Before him, 
Scotus Erigena and Berengarius had been led into error by pride and 
ambition.  Erigena, in his writings against Gotteschalk, became the 
forerunner of Calvinism by propounding his strange theories on 
Predestination.  He was suspected, also, of denying the Real Presence 
of Our Lord in the Eucharist, a heresy which was openly taught by 
Berengarius, Archdeacon of Tours, who, jealous of the reputation of 
Lanfranc, and desiring to support his fallen credit, began to lecture 
on the Sacred Scripture, a subject which he had never studied.  He 
explained the Scriptures, not according to the traditions of the 
Fathers, but after the whims of his own imagination, and soon fell into 
error with regard to infant baptism, marriage and the Eucharist.<p> 

In truth, Erigena and Berengarius were good dialecticians, but the 
shoemaker should stick to his last, and misfortune overtook these 
logicians when they began to dabble in theology, without any sufficient 
training in this branch of knowledge.  Berengarius was merely an 
imitator of Erigena, and Erigena was the proto-parent of the 
Rationalistic spirit which found a champion in Abelard.<p>

These three philosophers were so puffed up with vain knowledge and 
self-sufficiency that they thought themselves capable of understanding 
and explaining everything, and the attempt to explain everything is the 
distinguishing character of the Rationalism of the Middle Ages, of 
which Abelard was the principal type as well as the chief defender.<p>

<A NAME="Abela"><b>Abelard's Career.</b></a> -- The meteoric career of 
this erratic genius extends from the latter half of the eleventh to the 
first half of the twelfth century (1079-1142).  Born in 1079, at 
Palais, near Nantes, in Brittany, he had an exciting life from the time 
when he first attracted attention at Paris, by contradicting and 
refuting his professor, William of Champeaux, until his quiet death, 
full of repentance, in 1142.  He himself has told us that the lack of 
courage led him to prefer the pursuit of learning to the profession of 
arms, and all things seemed to indicate that nature had destined him to 
be a scholar rather than a soldier.  He was an apt pupil, quick, witty, 
attractive in his personal appearance, gentle and winning in his 
manners, and soon became a favorite with his professors and fellow-
students.  Not satisfied with the opportunities for learning offered in 
his own diocese, he came to Paris to hear the lectures of William of 
Champeaux, who was then teaching dialectics in that city.  Abelard had 
manifested a decided liking for this branch of knowledge, and now he 
had the best opportunity the world could offer of perfecting himself in 
philosophy.<p> 

This was the turning-point in his career.  Unfortunately for the young 
student his new surroundings were most favorable for nourishing the 
pride which was fast waxing strong in his bosom and which subsequently 
caused his downfall.  <i>Addiscentem oportet credere</i>.  One who is 
to learn from another must have humility, and he must have confidence in 
the ability of  his master, on whose authority he accepts truths until 
he can investigate them for himself.<p>

<A NAME="Attac"><b>Attacks His Masters.</b></a> -- Abelard was too 
proud to listen in humble silence, and to accept statements even on the 
authority of William of Champeaux, who was then at the height of his 
reputation.  Whilst we condemn the pride of the disciple, we must 
admire his genius, for William was then propounding his own false 
theory -- exaggerated Realism -- on the nature of universal ideas.  The 
master at first was amused and delighted with the subtle questions and 
objections proposed by his new pupil, but it soon became evident that 
Abelard aimed higher than the mere proposal of vexatious questions in 
the class-room.  He intended to refute and confound his master.  An 
easy undertaking, since he had merely to prove against William that 
universals are not actually inherent in the individuals of a class.  
William of Champeaux withdrew in confusion to the abbey of St. Victor, 
near Paris, and his successful rival founded a school of his own at 
Melun.<p> 

Abelard's health becoming impaired, he retired for a time into 
Brittany, then returned to Paris, where he again placed himself under 
his old master.  Again they quarreled, and Abelard reopened his school, 
which was in 1115 transferred to Mont Ste. Genevieve, near Paris, where 
his lectures were listened to by vast throngs of students who deserted 
the old master.<p>

Up to this time Abelard could be reproached with nothing but pride and 
false philosophy.  Authors do not agree in determining the name that 
should be given to his theory on the Universals.  John of Salisbury 
wrote that he was a Nominalist, and this is not improbable, as his 
first master was Roscelin, founder of the Nominalists.  Others assert, 
and their opinion is more commonly accepted, that he was the author of 
Conceptualism, which asserts that universal ideas are nothing more than 
conceptions of our mind, to which no objective realities correspond in 
the individuals.  Such a proud spirit could not be content with 
philosophy alone, and when William of Champeaux was appointed bishop of 
Ch&acirc;lons, Abelard went to Laon, to hear the lectures of the 
celebrated Anselm of Laon.<p> 

<A NAME="Ansel"><b>Anselm of Laon.</b></a> -- Anselm was a teacher of 
the old school. For forty years he had labored in the cause of 
education, and he was saluted as <i>Doctor Doctorum</i> -- the Doctor 
of Doctors -- but his methods did not please the brilliant and 
ambitious young philosopher.<p> 

Anselm was a quiet, one might say an easy-going professor, who was well 
acquainted with the doctrines of the Fathers and always walked in the 
beaten paths.   We are told that he was stronger in exposition than in 
argument.  "He could expound better than he could reply and he could 
state the doctrine of the Church more ably than he could defend it."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n16">[16]</a>  Who can picture to himself Abelard 
listening patiently to the lectures of the dear old professor, who did 
not care to give the new pupil occasion to display his knowledge of 
Logic and his power of debate?  "His learning," wrote the dissatisfied 
disciple, "was nothing but foliage without fruit; long custom, rather 
than any real merit, had acquired him a name.  If you consulted him on 
any difficulty, you came away just as wise as you went.  There was 
nothing but abundance of fine words, without a grain of sense or 
reason."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n17">[17]</a>  Abelard made up his mind 
that no master could teach him, and boldly declared that no master was 
necessary, since any man of ordinary gifts, with the help of the 
Fathers, could understand the Scriptures.<p> 

<A NAME="Abel2"><b>Abelard Lectures on Theology.</b></a> -- To make 
good his proud boast, he announced that, with only one day of 
preparation, he would explain the prophecy of Ezechiel.  The admirers 
of Abelard were horrified: this was arrogance unheard of, for he had 
never followed a regular course of theology, and the system of 
graduation in the Middle Ages required all candidates to go through a 
long and severe course under an old and approved Doctor before they 
were authorized to teach.  It was very unfortunate for Abelard that he 
succeeded so well in this rash undertaking.  "My road is not the road 
of custom, but the road of genius," was his answer to those who tried 
to dissuade him; and his genius was so great that his explanations of 
the prophecies astonished his hearers, wit and fluency of language 
supplying the defect of theological learning.<p> 

He now became fully convinced that he could explain everything; and 
this conviction explains the errors into which he fell when he 
undertook to teach theology.  Through the influence of Anselm's 
supporters he was compelled to discontinue the lectures on Ezechiel.  
Returning to Paris in 1114, he was appointed to the chair of the 
cloister of Notre Dame, which had become vacant by the promotion to the 
episcopate of William of Champeaux, and he began to lecture on 
dialectics and theology with such success that students flocked to 
him from all parts of the world.  "From Rome, in spite of mountains and 
robbers," writes Cardinal Newman, "from England, in spite of the sea; 
from Flanders and Germany; from Normandy and the remote districts of 
France; from Angers and Poitiers; from Navarre by the Pyrenees, and 
from Spain, besides the students of Paris itself."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n18">[18]</a><p>

"Not only the students, but the very inhabitants of Paris," writes 
Vaughan, "paid him a homage which almost amounted to a sort of worship. 
. . .  He could not pass to and from his lecture-hall without 
attracting the gaze of the Parisians.  The boys who thronged the 
streets, on his approach, with his fine figure, his beautiful 
countenance, and his distinguished air, respectfully made way for him, 
and for a moment arrested their boisteerous mirth to gaze in silence 
upon the most brilliant philosopher of the age.  The inhabitants of the 
houses by which he passed left their occupations to watch him from 
their doors; and we are told that the women in the topmost stories of 
those lofty buildings would draw back the curtains of their windows, to 
catch a glimpse of the greatest of living orators -- the gay and 
handsome cavalier, as he swept by, surrounded by a swarm of his 
disciples, who were still under the spell of his spirit-stirring 
eloquence."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n19">[19]</a>  All those honors were 
showered on the brilliant young professor, who was consumed by pride 
and ambition.<p> 

His head was turned, and soon afterwards his heart was lost, when he 
was appointed to be the preceptor of Helo&iuml;se by her uncle, Canon 
Fulbert, who discovered, when it was too late, that the professor had 
abused the confidence reposed in him.  After this disgraceful episode, 
which upset, and ever afterwards saddened the careers of the two guilty 
participants, Abelard entered the monastery of St. Denis as a monk, but 
he was not permitted to remain in solitude.  Petitions were sent to him 
from the university students, requesting him to resume his lectures, 
and he returned to Paris.<p>

<A NAME="Abel3"><b>Abelard Condemned.</b></a> -- Not content with his 
fame as an orator and a philosopher, he was ambitious to be regarded as 
a theologian.  His treatment of the mysteries of the faith was 
irreverent.  The Scholastics were jealous of his success, and joined 
with the Mystics in complaining of his irreverence.  His book, entitled 
"Introduction to Theology," which was in reality a treatise on the 
Trinity, was condemned by the Council of Soissons, in 1121, and the 
author was confined in a monastery to do penance, being first required 
to recite the Athanasian Creed and to burn the book with his own hand 
before the assembled Fathers.  Crushed and disgusted with the world, he 
retired into a solitude near the city of Troyes, to which he gave the 
name of "The Paraclete," but he did not there find comfort or rest.  
His retreat was discovered, and crowds of students again flocked to 
him, building huts in the solitude, providing food for themselves and 
the master.<p> 

<A NAME="StBer"><b>St. Bernard Appears.</b></a> -- We find Abelard 
again teaching at Paris in 1136, but in the meantime a strong and 
zealous champion of the faith had appeared in St. Bernard, whose 
attention had been directed to the errors of Abelard by William of 
Thierry and St. Norbert.  Bernard reminded him that he confounded the 
teachings of faith with the principles of philosophy, and accused him 
of false doctrine on the important questions of the Trinity, the Person 
of the Mediator, the Holy Ghost, the Sacraments, and man's common 
redemption.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n20">[20]</a>  Abelard requested the 
Archbishop of Sens to give him the privilege of publicly defending 
himself.  The request was granted, and St. Bernard was chosen to defend 
the Faith.  His humility made him reluctant to accept the challenge, 
and well might he have feared the conflict, for Abelard had many 
followers and sympathizers; he was eloquent of speech, able in debate, 
and capable of diverting the minds of men from the questions at issue 
by his powers of ridicule and satire.<p> 

The day was appointed for the Synod, which was held at Sens in 1140.  
St. Bernard, whose humility yielded to the entreaties of the 
archbishop, read a list of heresies taken from Abelard's theology, and 
then called upon him to defend the propositions, to amend them, or to 
deny them.  "I will not answer the Cistercian," replied Abelard; "I 
appeal from the Council to the See of Rome."  Rome approved the action 
of the Council, and the sentence imposing silence upon Abelard forever 
was confirmed by Innocent II.  Turning back from Lyons when news of 
Rome's decision reached him, he was kindly received by Peter the 
Venerable, Abbot of Cluny, who reconciled him with St. Bernard, and 
obtained for him absolution from the Pope.<p>

<A NAME="Repen"><b>Repentance and Death.</b></a> -- The proud spirit 
was finally subdued, and Abelard spent the remainder of his days in 
solitude and penance.  He died an exemplary death, professing adherence 
to the orthodox faith, in the Priory of St. Marcellus, at Chalon-sur-
Sa&ocirc;ne, on the 21st day of April, 1142, being sixty-three years of 
age.<p> 

Thus ended the career of one whose genius all must admire, whose 
misfortunes all deplore.  He was a proud philosopher; he escapes the 
charge of heresy simply because he was not obstinate, always professing 
his willingness to submit to lawful authority, and he did submit in the 
end.  Had he not been blinded by pride, his might have been an honored 
name in the annals of the Catholic Church.<p>

<A NAME="Error"><b>Errors of Abelard.</b></a> -- The principal errors 
which he defended were the following:  (1) In philosophy he defended 
<i>Conceptualism</i>, which has been sufficiently explained, and 
<i>Optimism</i>, a theory which was afterwards adopted by Leibnitz.  
This system teaches that god, in creating, was bound to choose the best 
and most perfect; that God was not free in creating the world, and that 
it would be impossible to create a world more perfect than the present; 
(2) his greatest mistakes were made concerning the relation of 
philosophy to revelation.  Being puffed up with vain knowledge he 
acknowledged no distinction between the truths of faith and truths 
manifested by the light of reason, and pretended that there was no 
mystery, even the Trinity, that could not be explained by reason.  This 
is the fundamental and most important of all his errors; all others 
spring from this or cluster around it.  Reason was the shrine at which 
he worshipped.  He was profuse in his praises of philosophy and of the 
philosophers, especially of Plato and Aristotle, and when his proud 
spirit was finally subdued, he confessed with humility and deep regret 
that he had set more store on being a second Aristotle than on being a 
follower of Jesus Christ.  From his exaggeration of the claims of 
reason arose that spirit of doubt and scepticism which pervades all his 
writings on subjects pertaining to the Faith.  Not satisfied with 
proclaiming, like St. Paul, the necessity of rendering to God a 
"reasonable service,"<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n21">[21]</a> he pretended 
that a philosopher should begin by doubting all the truths of 
revelation, and maintained that faith proceeds from scientific 
investigation.<p> 

Faith rests on the authority of Almighty God; reason's duty consists in 
proving that God has spoken in revelations; whoever attempts to prove 
the mysteries of faith by reason will either reject revelation 
altogether, or will end by doubting all the truths of faith.  This is 
what happened to Abelard.  Attempting to prove all dogmatic truths by 
reason he did not, and could not, attain to absolute certainty, but 
only to probability, which led to doubt.  In his work "Sic et non" (The 
Yes and No, or the Affirmative and the Negative), he took various 
propositions of faith and morals, and placed by the side of them the 
texts of Scripture and passages from the Fathers telling for and 
against each, and apparently contradictory of one another, without 
attempting to reconcile them.<p>

It is easy enough to raise doubts and propose objections; it is easier 
to tear down than to build.  Abelard had never studied theology; hence 
he was not capable of giving solid instruction in a scientific treatise 
on the mysteries of the faith; but he was brilliant and fluent, and he 
could propose doubts, without being able to offer a satisfactory 
solution.  In this way he came to be regarded as the parent of a 
Scepticism which he never really intended to foster, and modern 
Sceptics and Rationalists have been too hasty in choosing him as their 
great champion.<p>

Jutice to Abelard and the rights of truth, demand that we note a marked 
distinction between the rationalistic spirit of the Middle Ages and the 
Rationalism of later times.  Abelard exaggerated the claims of reason, 
but he continued to believe in the mysteries of faith.  Modern 
Rationalism says: "What cannot be understood must be rejected."  
Abelard said: "I believe in the mysteries, e.g., of the Trinity and of 
the Eucharist, but I believe also that I can explain them."  Certainly 
there is a vast difference between saying: "I believe and I can 
explain," and "I will not believe because I cannot explain."  Abelard 
did not intend in his "Sic et Non" to attack any dogma of the faith; 
his purpose was to excite rational doubts, which would in the end have 
resulted in a more intelligent faith; for "doubt leads to inquiry, and 
inquiry leads to the truth."  Had he been trained in theology as he was 
skilled in logic he would have acquired fame as an expounder and 
defender of the faith that was in him.  In other words, he was a 
misguided, proud philosopher, who attempted to explain the mysteries of 
faith by the light of reason and succeeded only in exciting doubts.<p>

<A NAME="GoodR"><b>Good Resulting from Abelard's Career.</b></a> -- We 
deplore his errors and his misfortunes, yet we recognize the fact that 
his stormy career had one beneficial effect on the theological studies 
of the Middle Ages. His criticisms caused the writers on theology to be 
more systematic in their expositions of Catholic truth, more careful 
and more patient in solving doubts and objections to the mysteries of 
faith.  Opposition to Abelard's rationalistic spirit gave to the world 
the saintly mystics of the School of St. Victor.  Seeing the errors 
into which Abelard was led by exaggerating the claims of reason, these 
mystics proclaimed that charity was more than mere learning, and the 
principle that animated them was expressed in the well-known saying of 
a well-known mystic of the fifteenth century: "It is better to feel 
compunction than to know its definition."  On the other hand, the 
claims of reason were not to be neglected; they were recognized and 
applied to the science of the faith by the Scholastic writers of the 
thirteenth century, for whom Abelard and the Mystics prepared the way.
