<H1>Specimen Pages from the Summa Theologica of St. Thomas</h1>

In the foregoing chapter an attempt was made to give a general view of 
the Summa of St. Thomas.  The broad outlines of this great monument of 
human genius were pointed out in a hurried description; we did not 
pause to consider the many beautiful details of the grand structure.  
We passed along the street as it were and cast a glance of admiration 
at the vast cathedral which adorned it; we had no time to enter in 
order to see the beauty of the sacred edifice from within its hallowed 
walls.  We beheld from afar the magnificent proportions of a gigantic 
structure; we did not approach in order to inspect more closely the 
everlasting work of the immortal builder.  Coming face to face with the 
monument erected by a great genius we were filled with admiration and 
astonishment; recovering from those first impressions we now wish to 
gratify the laudable curiosity which prompts us to examine more closely 
the edifice which for more than six hundred years has excited the 
admiration of all who love the grand, the good, the beautiful and the 
true.  However strongly we may covet the honor of being reputed a good 
<i>cicerone,</i> we find it necessary at the very beginning of this 
pilgrimage to the cathedral erected by St. Thomas, to make a 
declaration which is never made by the professional guide.<p>

<A NAME="TheCi"><b>The Cicerone's Humble Declaration.</b></a> -- I 
cannot promise to point out and explain every object of interest in the 
edifice.  To appreciate the beauties of the Summa one must spend not 
only an hour or a day, but weeks and months, yes, years, in 
contemplating the grandeur of the general plan and the perfection of 
the details of this remarkable production of the great architect of 
theology.  We must, of necessity, content ourselves with the selection 
of a few specimens of singular strength and beauty which will serve to 
give us an insight into the mind of the architect.  In other words -- 
and here we lay aside the metaphor -- it is our intention to give in 
this article some specimens of St. Thomas' doctrine and method, 
choosing from different parts of the Summa principles which will show 
that faith does not hamper reason, but that reason in a Christian 
philosopher, enlightened and guided by faith, may soar to the summit of 
intelligent research, good sense and sound judgment.  The Summa 
represents the perfection of reason applied to the truths of faith in 
the manner in which it should be used, viz., as the servant of the 
higher truth which God deigned to reveal to men.  For that very reason 
the Angelic Doctor is the greatest of Christian philosophers and the 
Prince of Theologians; he is the giant beside whom other philosophers 
and theologians appear as mere striplings, great and useful though they 
may be and are in their own sphere; thus it will be instructive as well 
as interesting to know something of his method in treating questions of 
philosophy and theology.<p> 

<A NAME="Diffi"><b>Difficulty of Choosing Specimens.</b></a> -- We are 
well aware that any one attempting to give what might be called 
illustrations from the Summa must contend with two serious 
difficulties.  First, he meets with what the French so aptly term 
<i>l'embarras du choix;</i> when there are so many excellencies it is 
difficult to choose one or a few as the objects of our special study 
and admiration.  In the second place, St. Thomas' works were written in 
Latin, and in a style which was peculiarly his own; for lucidity, 
brevity and expressiveness nothing like it has ever been known.  It is 
our firm conviction that all the great professors of Yale, Harvard, 
Oxford and Cambridge could never reproduce in English a page of St. 
Thomas which would do justice to the original.  The mere mention of 
these two difficulties will be equivalent to a request that the reader 
kindly bear in mind, first, that the specimens given are only a few out 
of many that might have been chosen to illustrate St. Thomas' doctrine; 
secondly, that expositions of his doctrine given in English fall short 
of the beauty, strength, accuracy and completeness of the Latin in 
which St. Thomas expressed, with the greatest ease and apparently 
without effort, the sublimest doctrines of theology.<p> 

<A NAME="Divis"><b>Division of the Summa Recalled.</b></a> -- Let us 
begin this investigation by recalling the grand division of the "Summa 
Theologica" in its three parts.  The first treats of God -- of God in 
Himself, one nature in three persons; of God as the Author and Ruler of 
the universe.  The second treats of the tendency of the rational 
creature to God; in other words, of God as the end of man, and of human 
acts in general (1a 2ae) and in particular (2a 2ae).  The third treats 
of Christ, who as man is the way by which we tend to God:  in other 
words, of God as Redeemer, of the sacraments, and of the eternal life 
to which Christ conducts men.  This division is recalled because we 
intend, in choosing specimens of St. Thomas' doctrine to follow the 
order of the Summa.<p> 

<A NAME="Princ"><b>Principles of Pedagogy.</b></a> -- Yielding to an 
inclination which is entirely in accordance with the fitness of things, 
we shall select for the first specimen St. Thomas' principles on 
<i>teaching</i>.  In his commentary on the Gospel according to St. 
Matthew, St. Thomas has sketched the character of an ideal Christian 
<i>Doctor,</i> of one who teaches the truths of religion.  The perfect 
Doctor, he says, is one whose life as well as whose doctrine is light.  
Three things are necessary to him:  <i>stability,</i> that he may never 
deviate from the truth; <i>clearness,</i> that he may teach without 
obscurity; and <i>purity of intention,</i> that he may seek God's glory 
and not his own (in cap. v. <i>Matt</i>).  In the Prologue to the Summa 
and in several articles in the body of the work he lays down principles 
concerning teachers in general.  The few words which he wrote by way of 
introduction to the <i>Summa,</i> giving his reasons for composing a 
manual of theology, are a mine of information concerning his principles 
on pedagogy, or the art of teaching the young.<p> 

<A NAME="Prolo"><b>Prologue to the Summa.</b></a> -- "We have 
considered that beginners in this sacred science find many impediments 
in those things which have been written by various authors; partly, on 
account of the multiplication of useless questions, articles and 
arguments; partly, because those things which are necessary for the 
education of novices [i. e., <i>beginners</i>] are not treated 
systematically, but as the exposition of certain books or the occasion 
of disputation demanded; and partly because the frequent repetitions 
beget confusion and disgust in the minds of learners."<p> 

<A NAME="Hints"><b>Hints to Teachers.  Avoid Useless Questions.</b></a> 
-- Do not overload the mind of the beginner with a multitude of useless 
questions; choose those that are primary and fundamental; give the 
student a clear knowledge of them, bearing in mind the capacity of the 
pupil; establish them by a few good, strong arguments, if proofs are 
necessary, and then pass on to something more particular, without 
consuming valuable time in dealing with hair-splitting arguments which 
the beginner cannot understand, and in the study of which there is 
little profit and much annoyance.  These remarks of St. Thomas were a 
quiet criticism of a Scholasticism which was carried to excess, but 
they express a general rule which should be observed in all 
institutions of learning, from the highest university down to the 
lowest primary school.  Neglect of this rule often resulted in 
thrusting upon the community a class of so-called graduates, with a 
smattering of everything and a real knowledge of nothing -- graduates 
who made our fathers sigh, sometimes not without reason, for the old-
time schoolhouses and the days of "the three Rs."<p> 

<A NAME="Order"><b>Order.</b></a> -- In the next place, books for 
beginners should be written with due regard for scientific order, which 
is conducive to clearness and perception and helpful to the memory.  
The importance of this canon will be readily admitted by all who have 
ever attempted to "straighten out" the ideas of one who was not from 
the beginning of his education trained to think and study with order.  
Theology was a confused mass of dogmas, disputes and objections until 
St. Thomas introduced order into the chaos.  As it was with theology so 
has it been, so shall it be, with other branches of knowledge, if due 
attention is not given to the scientific distribution of the subjects 
treated.  By paying attention to this rule St. Thomas made it possible 
to take in at one glance the whole field of Catholic Theology.<p> 

<A NAME="Avoid"><b>Avoid Repetitions.</b></a> -- Thirdly, avoid 
repetitions which, if they be frequent and unnecessary, excite disgust 
and cause confusion.  For those who are very young it is necessary to 
repeat the same thing frequently in order that it may be indelibly 
impressed on their minds; but there is a limit to this necessity.  Many 
a boy has left school in disgust because he was not allowed to advance, 
but was held back, waiting perhaps for dull or lazy classmates, and had 
to listen for weeks or months to the same old story.  But, we must not 
enter into the details of school or college life; we merely wished to 
call attention to a principle which guided St. Thomas when he wrote the 
Summa.  The three rules which have been mentioned he followed to the 
letter, writing "with brevity and clearness" on those things which 
pertain to sacred doctrine, and that is one of the reasons why his 
Summa is still regarded as the model manual of theology.  The advanced 
student can find in it material for deep and mature thought, and 
beginners who have read its pages are unanimous in declaring that it is 
the most satisfactory and the clearest of all theologies.<p> 

<A NAME="Teach"><b>Teaching and Learning.</b></a> -- In the first 
article, 117th question of the first part, St. Thomas asks the 
question;  Can one man teach another?  After rejecting the theories of 
Averroes and Plato -- opinions which were founded on their false 
systems with regard to the union of soul and body -- the Angelic Doctor 
gives his own answer to the question.  One man can teach another, and 
the teacher can be truly said to impart knowledge to the mind of the 
pupil by causing him actually to know that which before he had only the 
capacity to know.  Of the effects produced by an external agent, some 
are caused by an external agent alone, some are caused by an external 
agent and also by a cause operating from within.  Thus a house 
contributes nothing to its own erection; the work is all done by an 
external agent, the builder.  But health is caused in a sick person 
sometimes by the medicine which he takes and sometimes by the 
recuperative powers of nature itself.  When two causes cooperate in the 
production of such effects it must be remembered that the principal 
cause is not the external agent, but the internal one; the external 
agent is the assistant, furnishing means and aid which the internal 
agent makes use of to produce the desired effect.  The physician does 
not produce health; health is produced by nature aided by the physician 
and his remedies.<p> 

This is what takes place when one man teaches another.  Knowledge in the 
pupil must result from the activity of his own mind.  Sometimes, without the 
aid of a teacher, he can acquire knowledge by his own exertions, applying 
the native force of his mind by which he naturally knows the first 
principles of all knowledge.  Sometimes he is taught by another, but even 
then the mind of the pupil is the principal cause, the teacher is only the 
assistant, stating universal propositions from which others follow, or 
giving examples and similitudes which readily bring to the mind things of 
which the pupil had not thought, or showing the connexion between principles 
and conclusions which the pupil would not have noticed if the master had not 
called his attention to them.<p>

This, according to St. Thomas, is how a master causes a pupil to know 
things.  It is not like the process of pouring water into a vessel.  He is 
not simply the receiver of good things from without; he is a living agent, 
and all the teachers in the world can do him no good unless they adopt 
methods which will stimulate the activity of his mind.  No one can know for 
another, each one must know for himself; teachers are only intended to 
excite the latent energies of our minds and to help us in knowing.  It is 
not well to make things too easy for learners; if the mind of the pupil is 
not called upon to digest and assimilate the food administered by the 
teacher, the knowledge communicated, often with great pains on the part of 
the teacher, will be -- to use a common expression -- like water poured into a 
sieve.  If you wish to know a good teacher, and if you wish to know a 
well-written book intended to stimulate healthy activity in the minds 
of students, read the Summa of St. Thomas.<p> 

<A NAME="StTho"><b>St. Thomas and the Necessity of Revelation.</b></a> 
-- From the prologue let us pass to the first article of the Summa, 
where St. Thomas treats of the necessity of revelation for the 
knowledge of natural truths.  Because all men by the light of reason 
can know some things, Rationalists and infidels say that men can know 
all things without the aid of revelation.  Catholic theologians were 
not slow to answer that men, as they have been and as they are, cannot 
without revelation have a perfect knowledge even of those truths which 
come within the scope of their natural capacity for knowing.  In their 
zeal for the defence of God's teaching some theologians went so far as 
to assert that without the aid of revelation, which had been handed 
down by tradition in the human family, men cannot have a certain and 
perfect knowledge of any supersensible truth.  This was an 
exaggeration, and Traditionalism has been condemned by the Vicar of 
Christ on earth.  (Greg. XVI, Sept. 8, 1840.  See Denzinger, 
<i>Enchir</i>., n. 1622).<p> 

St. Thomas pointed out the medium between Rationalism and Traditionalism.  
In the 88th question of the first part of the Summa he proves that man can 
know supersensible and immaterial things, and even God Himself.  But that 
knowledge would not suffice for the human race in its present condition in 
order that all might have a perfect knowledge of natural truths, especially 
of truths that pertain to God.  The reader's attention may here be called to 
the fact that the Fathers of the Vatican Council in defining the necessity 
of revelation, used almost the same words employed by St. Thomas in the 
first article of the "Summa Theologica," and in the fourth chapter, first 
book, of the "Summa Contra Gentiles."  The Vatican Council says that the 
revelation of natural truths is necessary in order that they may be known 
"by all men, without delay, with certitude and without admixture of error."  
St. Thomas had written in the "Summa Theologica":  without revelation these 
truths could be known "only by a few, after a long time, and with the 
admixture of many errors."  These words are a repetition of what he wrote in 
the "Summa Contra Gentiles," where he says that God in His goodness proposed 
those natural truths to be believed by men that thus "all might easily have 
the knowledge of God without doubt and without error."  Now, how does he 
prove his thesis?  Without revelation the truths of natural religion would 
have been known only by a few for three reasons:  first, some men are unfit 
for study:  hence they could never attain to the summit of knowledge which 
consists in knowing God.  Again, some are too much occupied with temporal 
affairs; hence they would not have the time to acquire knowledge of the 
sublimest truths.  Lastly, some men are lazy, and although God has implanted 
in them a natural desire to know Him, they would never undergo the labor 
which is the price that must be paid for the knowledge of metaphysical 
truths. <p>

Even those few would acquire this knowledge only after a long time, 
because (<i>a</i>) the truths of which we are speaking are profound 
truths, and (<i>b</i>) a long preparation is necessary before men can 
understand them, and (<i>c</i>) whilst men are young the passions 
prevent the attentive consideration of sublime truths.  But even after 
long preparation and study those few would still be in doubt and be 
subject to error.  We are all liable to err.  Knowing this and knowing 
that the greatest philosophers dispute about important question, and 
often mix in with the truth things that are false or doubtful or only 
half proved, where are we to find amongst men that freedom from error 
and doubt without which our knowledge even of natural truths will be 
very imperfect and unsatisfactory?  Consequently, revelation is 
necessary in order that those truths may be known by all, without 
delay, with certainty and without error.  Comments would destroy the 
beauty and the force of those words.  I simply ask:  Where can we find 
anything to equal the conciseness and the completeness of that 
article?<p> 

<A NAME="Ontol"><b>Ontologism and Kantism.</b></a> -- St. Thomas is 
scarcely less admirable in his refutation of Ontologism.  This name has 
been given to a system which teaches that the first idea formed in the 
human mind is a direct knowledge of God.  Without that idea we can have 
no scientific knowledge; with that idea we can have a certain and 
infallible knowledge of all things.  We do not see the essence of God 
as He is in Himself, but we see that essence as it represents all 
things, which were first conceived in the mind of God and were then 
created in accordance with the idea of the Divine Architect of the 
world.<p> 

This system was taught by Malebranche in the seventeenth century, and 
afterwards, with various modifications unnecessary to explain, by Gioberti 
and others, notably in our own times by Professor Ubaghs, a great light of 
the University of Louvain.<p>

It cannot be denied that if the propositions of the Ontologists could 
be admitted we should have a ready answer to the objections made by 
sceptics against the scientific value of metaphysical knowledge.  We 
have knowledge, it could be answered, of truths that are universal, 
immutable, necessary and eternal, because we see them in the eternal 
and immutable Author of all things and all truth.  Kant and his 
disciples could no longer claim that our metaphysical knowledge is 
destitute of a scientific basis.  Although the senses do not manifest 
the eternal, necessary and immutable truth of first principles, e.g., 
of the principle of contradiction; a thing cannot be and not be at the 
same time, or the whole is greater than its part, nevertheless we see 
these truths in God when He is seen by our minds.  Such a defence of 
metaphysics, however, is based upon an exaggeration of the truth, and 
Ontologism was condemned by a decree of the Inquisition dated Sept. 
18th, 1861.  Verily there is nothing new under the sun.  St. Thomas had 
refuted Ontologism six hundred years before the date of the decree.  In 
the 11th article, question 12 of the first part of the Summa, he proves 
that no one can see the essence of God in this life; this vision is 
reserved for the blessed who always see Him face to face.  In the 5th 
article, question 84 of the same part, he shows that there is no 
necessity of saying that we see all things <i>in God</i> as in a 
mirror; because we have our intellects, which are rays emanating from 
the Divine Light, distinct from God and caused by Him.  What the 
intellect manifests is truth, and we know it to be the truth because of 
the evidence and light which accompany the manifestation in our minds 
(<i>vide</i> 1 P., qq. 16 and 17).  We know the truths:  two and two 
make four; the whole is greater than its part; there is no effect 
without a cause, etc., because we <i>see</i> them.  There is no more 
necessity of proving these truths than there is of proving the reality 
of the stone or brick falling on one's head.  If you analyze and apply 
those principles, they will reveal the Source of all truth, as rays 
make known the sun from which they emanate, but they are not God, they 
are participations of the eternal Truth which enlightens all men.  St. 
Thomas goes farther, and in the 2a 2ae, question 173, first article, he 
anticipates an answer which the Ontologists might make, and explodes 
the distinction on which it is based.  In the time of St. Thomas some 
writers thought to explain the gift of prophecy by saying that prophets 
see God to whom the past, present and future are one.  When they are 
asked, as we ask the Ontologists:  In what then do they differ from the 
blessed in heaven? the answer was:  They see God not as He is in 
Himself, but in as much as He contains representations of future 
events.  Worthless distinction, says St. Thomas.  You cannot see things 
as they are represented in the essence of God without seeing the 
essence of God.  The representations or ideas of things (<i>rationes 
rerum</i>) in God are the essence of God as it represents things, past, 
present or future.  If God were composed of parts we might see one part 
without seeing the other, but whoever is looking directly at a thing 
that is simple sees either all of it or nothing.  The participations of 
the one great Truth are manifold; hence we can see one without seeing 
the other or without seeing the source; but whoever sees these truths 
in the essence sees also the source, unless words have lost all 
meaning.  Outside of these principles, which St. Thomas proposed as 
calmly as if he were writing the first page of an ABC book, there is no 
solid refutation of many of the high-sounding <i>isms</i> which make 
life burdensome to students of philosophy in our days.<p> 

<A NAME="StTh2"><b>St. Thomas and Interpretation of Scripture.</b></a> 
-- Another manifestation of St. Thomas' good judgment is to be found in 
those passages where he lays down rules for the interpretations of the 
Sacred Scriptures.  These rules are explained at some length in the 
Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII on the study of the Scriptures, and a 
glance at the document will show that they are taken in great part from 
the writings of St. Thomas.  In the course of the document the learned 
Pontiff frequently refers to his favorite theologian by the use of such 
expressions as, "St. Thomas being our guide," -- "St. Thomas here holds 
the first place" -- "St. Thomas teaches" -- "This course was pursued by 
that great theologian Thomas Aquinas," etc.  In thus quoting and 
following St. Thomas the Pope does not neglect other guides and other 
rules; they are, as it were, embodied in St. Thomas, because he may be 
regarded as the personification of the wisdom of preceding times, being 
in a special manner filled with reverence for the authority of the 
Church and for the writings of the Fathers, the two tribunals to which 
disputes on the Scriptures must be referred.  It is not to be expected 
that we should make a complete list of the rules laid down by St. 
Thomas for the study of the Scriptures, but we take pleasure in calling 
attention to a few principles which he proposed for the guidance of 
interpreters in cases of difficulty and doubt.  The importance of these 
principles is very strongly urged in the Pope's Encyclical, and 
although they are very plain and simple, it must be confessed that they 
have not always been observed by those who should have applied them.  
Attacks made at different times by so-called scientists against the 
first chapter of Genesis havae called forth many able books in defence 
of the revealed truth, but the defenders did not always observe that 
moderation and calmness which would have ensured uniformity of method 
in the defence, and which would have precluded the necessity of 
changing with the variations of science.  St. Thomas treated those very 
questions and found it necessary to discuss many theories offered in 
explanation of the words of Genesis.  He was not in the least disturbed 
by any of them and would not have been disturbed if the systems 
proposed had been twenty times as numerous as they were, because he was 
alway as guided by a good rule found in St. Augustine, based upon 
strong faith and good common sense.  In such questions, he wrote (1 P., 
q. 68, art. 1), two things are to be borne in mind:  first, that the 
Scriptures teach nothing but the truth.  Secondly, since passages of 
Scriptures can sometimes be explained in different ways, let no one 
hold one explanation so tenaciously that he would not be prepared to 
give it up if a better explanation were offered.  The first part of 
this rule -- about the truth of the Scriptures -- had it been known and 
observed, would have prevented many cases of scriptural heart disease 
which at times afflicted certain timorous believers who foolishly 
became excited by reason of the discovery of some scientist.  Let 
scientific men continue their investigations and excavations.  When 
they are prepared to tell us just what science teaches, not what so-
called scientists say, then we shall be prepared to meet them and to 
revise, if necesary, not the Scriptures -- because there can be no 
opposition between true science and the words of the Holy Ghost -- but 
our interpretation of Scripture.  Necessity for such revisions will not 
be very frequent, because it has happened and will happen again, that 
what was flashed over the wires as a new discovery of science was 
simply the hastily concocted theory of some unbeliever, who was over-
anxious to prove that there was no God and no hell.  There may be 
apparent contradictions between science and Genesis; but the Catholic 
Church is to last until the end of time, and she can wait until science 
has determined what is certain before deciding what interpretations of 
Genesis are to be abandoned.<p> 

The second part of St. Thomas' rule -- about various interpretations -- 
had it been known and observed, would have prevented two grave evils:  
first, the disappointment and vexation of those who see their pet 
theories overturned; secondly, the scoffing of unbelievers, when they 
see theologians offering first one explanation and then another in 
defending the faith.  St. Thomas lays down as a general rule that the 
defence of faith should not be based upon the reasons or theories 
advanced by different schools of theology.  To outsiders what the 
Church teaches and what a theologian of the Church teaches are one and 
the same thing; and if they overthrow the theologian they think they 
have overthrown the faith and the Church.  We who are of the faith know 
that theologians may make mistakes, whilst the Holy Ghost cannot teach 
error; even St. Thomas might fall, but the Church built upon the rock 
shall stand forever.  St. Thomas, true to his principles, allowed the 
greatest latitude in interpreting the first chapter of Genesis, and any 
other part of Scripture, when the sense of the words had not been 
determined by the authority of the Church.  He favors the system which 
says that the days of creation are to be taken in the ordinary sense of 
the words, but he proposes his theory simply as an opinion, and does 
not reject the system of St. Augustine, who said that by the morning 
was meant the knowledge of things which the Angels have in the Word, 
i.e., in the beatific vision, and by the evening the knowledge of 
things which the Angels have outside of the Word, i.e., through infused 
ideas. He also mentions various theories about the light, the 
firmament, the condition of plants, trees and animals, when they were 
created, etc., but he had too much foresight and theological balance to 
tie himself down to any one theory; and thus the truth of the 
Scriptures remained intact whilst men and their theories appeared for a 
while on the scene and then passed away.<p> 

The specimens of St. Thomas' doctrine thus far given were taken from 
the first part of the Summa.  We must now pass on to inspect other 
parts of his great work.<p>

In the first place it may be remarked in a general way that the in 1a 2ae 
and 2a 2ae of St. Thomas there is more genuine moral theology, as a 
scientific knowledge of men and of their acts, than can be found in the 
hundreds of manuals or compendiums which have been written since the 
sixteenth century, and which can claim little merit except in so far as 
they apply to ever-changing times and circumstances the principles 
proposed by St. Thomas or by other great Scholastics.<p>

<A NAME="Human"><b>Human Acts, Virtues and Vices, Original Sin, Law, 
Grace.</b></a> -- His explanation of human acts and of those things 
which affect human acts; his definition and classification of the 
virtues and vices; his most sensible and most satisfactory explanation 
of original sin; the depth and accuracy of his treatise on laws; the 
sublimity and acumen of his tract on grace, have made the <i>prima 
secundae</i> the source and fountain-head from which flow the 
principles that should guide all those who wish to point out the true 
doctrine of the tendency of the rational creature to God.<p> 

<A NAME="BestF"><b>Best Form of Government.</b></a> -- In the 1a 2ae, 
question 105, article first, we find St. Thomas' opinion on the best 
form of government.  If we consider merely the words he uses it would 
be said that he pronounces in favor of a limited monarchy; but if we go 
below the words and consider the principles on which his conclusion is 
based, it will appear that the Angelic Doctor was not averse to a 
republic, and I believe that if he were living to-day he would be an 
ardent supporter of our form of government.  "One of the principal 
things to be considered," he wrote, "with regard to the good 
establishment of princes [rulers] is that all <i>should have some part 
in the government</i>; for in this way peace is preserved amongst the 
people, and all are pleased with such a disposition of things and 
maintain it.  The next thing to be considered is the form of 
government, of which there are principally two kinds:  a Kingdom, in 
which one rules, and an Aristocracy, in which a few exercise the 
authority.  The best form is that in which one rules over all, and 
under him there are others having authority, but the government 
pertains to all, because those who exercise authority can be chosen 
from all and are chosen by all. . . .  Hence the best government is a 
mixture of a Kingdom, of Aristocracy and of Democracy, i.e., <i>of the 
power of the people,</i> inasmuch as the rulers can be chosen from the 
people, and the election of the rulers belongs to the people."  There 
is a vast amount of good republicanism and of sound democracy in these 
words.  First, by the kind or monarch St. Thomas means nothing more 
than some <i>one</i> is to represent the governing authority.  
Secondly, the <i>aristocracy</i> means those who exercise a salutary 
restraint on the power of the head of the government; because if there 
were no restraint the power of the king, says St. Thomas (ad 2um), 
would easily degenerate into a tyranny.  Congressmen and senators, for 
instance, would supply the demand for an aristocracy.  Lastly, St. 
Thomas says that neither kingdom nor an aristocracy will form a stable 
government unless the element of democracy is introduced by permitting 
the choice of the rulers from the people and by the people, that thus 
all may have some part in the government.  These words lead us to 
believe that if St. Thomas were living to-day he would be a republican 
or a democrat.<p> 

<A NAME="Infal"><b>Infallibilty of the Pope.</b></a> -- In the Secunda 
Secundae, question 1, article 10, on Faith, St. Thomas teaches the 
infallibility of the Pope, "to whose authority it pertains to determine 
finally the things that are of faith, that they should be held by all 
with unwavering assent."  Hence, he adds, it has been the custom of the 
Church to refer to the Pope all the grave and difficult questions which 
arise; and our Lord said to St. Peter whom he appointed supreme 
Pontiff:  "I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not, and thou 
being once converted confirm thy brethren" (Luke, xxii, 32).  He then 
gives the following theological reason for his conclusion:  "There 
should be one faith in the Church, according to the words of St. Paul 
(1 Cor., I, 10):  'That you all speak the same things, and that there 
be no schisms among you.'  This will not be possible unless questions 
of faith that arise can be determined by the one who presides over the 
whole Church, so that his determination should be held by the whole 
Church."  Three hundred years before Protestantism was known, and six 
hundred years before the Vatican Council was celebrated, St. Thomas 
proclaimed and proved Papal Infallibility.<p> 

<A NAME="Infid"><b>Infidels Not to Be Forced to Believe.</b></a> -- In 
the tenth question, seventh article, of the same treatise, St. Thomas 
teaches that unbelievers cannot be compelled to accept the Christian 
faith; because to believe is an act of the will and the will cannot be 
forced.  Those who have accepted the faith can be punished if they fail 
to keep the promises which they made; unbelievers can lawfully be 
prevented from persecuting Christians, from blaspheming Christianity, 
or from carrying on a wicked proselytism; hence Christian nations have 
at times waged war against infidels.  But, even when unbelievers have 
been conquered and captured they must be left free to believe or not to 
believe.<p> 

These things do not suprise us, being so reasonable, so natural and so 
well known.  There are, however, in the world to-day -- some of them are 
in our own country -- men, who need the consoling assurance that the 
greatest of medieval theologians would not approve of a papal invasion 
for the purpose of compelling outsiders to accept the Roman Catholic 
faith.<p>

<A NAME="Child"><b>Children of Jews and Infidels.</b></a> -- St. Thomas 
will not allow the children of jews or other unbelievers to be baptised 
without the consent of their parents (2a 2ae, q. x, art. 12; 3 P., q 
68, art 10).  According to the natural law, a child, before he arrives 
at the use of reason, is under the care of his father (i.e., of his 
parents); hence it would be against natural justice if a child, before 
it acquires the use of reason, were withdrawn from the care of its 
parents, or if anything were done with it against the wish of the 
parents.<p> 

<A NAME="TheIn"><b>The Incarnation.</b></a> -- In the third part of the 
Summa, St. Thomas treats of the Incarnation, of the sacraments 
instituted by Christ, and of eternal life.  We read in the life of St. 
Thomas that on three different occasions Christ spoke to His servant, 
saying:  "Bene scripsisti de me, Thoma -- Thou has written well of Me, 
Thomas."  This approbation of our Lord should be understood as applying 
in a special manner to the third part of the Summa.  It is impossible 
to find anything more scientific and more sublime than St. Thomas' 
treatise on the Incarnation.  Starting out with the Scriptures in his 
hand, and with this one truth accepted on faith; Jesus was both God and 
man, he constructs a most remarkable treatise on the natures and person 
of Christ, on the acts and sufferings of God incarnate.  The tract 
contains fifty-nine questions, with an average of five or six articles 
to a question.  The Old and New Testaments, the councils, the decrees 
of the Popes, the writings of the Fathers, are all called upon to 
glorify Jesus Christ, the corner-stone on which our faith is built.  
The treatise is a most extraordinary combination of deep faith and 
piety, of theological learning and good sense.  What we know from good 
authority St. Thomas affirms with certainty, and no theologian can 
equal him when there is a question of determining the conclusions which 
can be drawn from the truths made known by faith.  On questions that 
depend on the will of God alone, if that will has not been made known 
to us, he wisely abstains from useless speculations.  In this he 
differs from writers of less renown who seem to be afraid of saying:  
There are some things which we do not know and cannot know until God 
speaks on the subject.<p> 

<A NAME="Bapti"><b>Baptism.</b></a> -- He applies the same rule in his 
treatise on the sacraments.  In his treatise, for instance, on the 
necessity of Baptism he first calls attention to the law of salvation 
laid down by our Savior Himself.  "Unless a man be born again of water 
and the Holy Ghost he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" (John, iii, 
5).  After that, when the question arises:  What, then is to become of 
children who die without having an opportunity to receive baptism?  St. 
Thomas answers:  As far as we know, men can do nothing for them; they 
are in the hands of God, who is all-powerful and just (3 P., q. 68, 
art. 11 and 1m).  Men may write for weeks and months; they may fill the 
pages of reviews and may publish books on this subject, but, since God 
has not deigned to make any special revelation concerning these 
children, they can give us no more satisfaction than that which is 
afforded by St. Thomas' short declaration:  Those children are in the 
hands of God; he will deal with them in justice and mercy.<p> 

<A NAME="TheEu"><b>The Eucharist.</b></a> -- His treatise on the 
Eucharist is one that would not disappoint those who expect something 
grand from the author of the Office of the Blessed Sacrament.  For St. 
Thomas the Eucharist, as a sacrament and as a sacrifice, was truly the 
center of the Christian religion.  Towards our Lord under the 
sacramental species he had a profound devotion and a tender piety; 
hence he threw his whole soul into his tract on this sacrament of love.  
The bread of the angels made the Angelic Doctor more angelic; the 
extraordinary perspicacity of his penetrating mind is nowhere more 
strikingly manifested than in the articles of this treatise where he 
develops the conclusions which flow from the dogmas of the Real 
Presence and of Transubstantiation, or where he answers the objections 
which had been made or could be made against this important doctrine of 
the Catholic Church.  Christ, in His sacred person and in the 
Eucharist, was the central object of St. Thomas' life and the center 
towards which all his theological treatises were directed.<p> 

For other specimens of St. Thomas' doctrine the reader is referred to 
that golden book, the Catechism of the Council of Trent, which was 
taken almost bodily from the "Summa Theologica," and was composed by 
three men who had spent their lives studying the works of the Angelic 
Doctor.  Cardinal Newman was in love with this book, and always spoke 
of it in terms of the highest praise.<p>

<A NAME="St Th3"><b>St. Thomas and the Encyclicals of Leo XIII.</b></a> 
-- We would also recommend most earnestly to those who wish to know St. 
Thomas the study of the dogmatic Encyclicals of the late Pope Leo XIII.  
Knowing the Pope to be an enthusiastic admirer of the Angelic Doctor 
our readers will not be suprised to learn that his dogmatic Encyclicals 
are to a great extent nothing more than development of principles laid 
down by St. Thomas.  This is in a special manner true of the 
Encyclicals on Scholastic Philosophy, the Christian Constitution of 
States, the Condition of Workingmen, the Study of the Scriptures, and 
Devotion to the Holy Ghost.  The Holy Father believed firmly that the 
principles of the Angelic Doctor would bring light and order into the 
darkness and confusion of the nineteenth century as they did in the 
thirteenth century.  We should feel very happy and fully repaid for the 
time spent on this volume if we could think that it might be the means 
of exciting a desire to know and to follow the words of advice 
addressed to the children of this troubled age, by the wise, learned 
and saintly Pope Leo XIII.<p>
