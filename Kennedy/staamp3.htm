<H1>The Experimental Sciences -- Albertus Magnus -- Roger Bacon</h1>

Very interesting in the history of philosophy in the Middle Ages is the 
chapter which treats of the condition of the experimental sciences 
amongst the Schoolmen.  The mere mention of this subject opens up a 
wide field of investigations, and before entering this field a few 
remarks should be made.<p>

<A NAME="CULTI">CULTIVATION OF EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCES NOT THE HIGHEST 
PERFECTION.</a> -- In the first place, it must not be supposed that 
proficiency in the physical and experimental sciences is the highest 
standard of perfection.  Nature is a book wherein we should study the 
wondrous works of the Creator; to leave this book unopened would be 
culpable negligence.  We must cultivate and develop all our faculties, 
yet it must be borne in mind that the highest perfection of man 
consists in the exercise of his highest faculties on their highest 
objects.  Now, we have faculties that are brought into use by 
observation, experiment, and analysis; and we have also the higher 
faculty of intelligence and reason.  All of these faculties can be 
exercised in the study of nature, if from nature we ascend to nature's 
God; but, be it remarked once for all, the observation, classification, 
and analysis of natural phenomena do not constitute the highest form of 
intellectual activity, especially if the devotees of this branch of 
knowledge studiously exclude from their investigations all that 
pertains to Metaphysics, Ethics and God.  Success in the experimental 
sciences is desirable; it is a perfection and a sign of progress; but 
it is not the highest form of progress and perfection, because there 
are higher and nobler objects on which the God-given faculties of our 
minds can be exercised.  In other words -- if we must make odious 
comparisons -- Plato was greater than Benjamin Franklin or Robert 
Fulton; St. Thomas Aquinas was greater than Edison; the author of a 
good catechism, or manual of religious instruction, is greater than the 
inventor of safety-matches.<p> 

It may be objected that such comparisons should not be made.  These men 
were all great, each in his own sphere, and they cannot be compared in 
relation to perfections pertaining to different orders and spheres.  
Well said; and the comparison shall not be made provided men refrain 
from speaking and acting as if the sum total of perfection were to be 
found in the cultivation of the experimental sciences, as if no man is 
entitled to be considered enlightened and learned unless he is an 
expert on suspension bridges and the latest patterns of the chainless 
bicycle.  We must do these things and not omit those.  We must guard 
against being carried away in the whirlwind of our busy, practical 
times, when we hear much in praise of inventors and those who make 
progress in the applied sciences, whilst there is little said in 
commendation of those who devote themselves to higher and nobler 
pursuits.  Very few dare to formulate these principles, proposing them 
as a theory or system, yet any intelligent observer knows that they are 
lik an under-current affecting the stream of public opinion in our 
days.  We must distinguish carefully between the dignity and the 
necessity or usefulness of certain kinds of knowledge. The practical 
value of a science or of sciences will be in proportion to the needs of 
mankind at certain epochs.  Most assuredly it would be the height of 
folly to claim that the educated men of America, France and England 
should devote their time and talents principally to philosophical 
speculations at the present time, when the work in chemical 
laboratories may decide the fate of a liberty-loving and 
knowledge-loving world.  Yet, who would not prefer the glory of an 
Augustine, a Thomas, even a Nicholas of Cusa, to the plaudits showered 
upon the inventors of liquid fire, the gas-mask, the depth bomb or the 
battling aeroplane?<p>

And to the peace-councils following the war, men of philosophic 
thought, historians, Christian statesmen and legislators, Christian 
gentlemen and scholars will be more valuable for the future peace and 
happiness of the world than the most ingenious inventor of 
death-dealing instruments.  Woodrow Wilson is not a "world-beater" in 
the applied sciences, but he is recognized as a world-leader.  From 
these considerations thoughtful men can draw their own conclusions, 
giving due value to the speculative and to the applied sciences.<p>

<A NAME="CHURC">CHURCH NOT OPPOSED TO SCIENCE.</a> -- In the next place 
it is to be observed that whoever wishes to make an impartial study of 
the subject which we are considering must banish forever from his mind 
the thought that the Catholic Church is opposed to knowledge or 
enlightenment of any kind, or that she does not desire or favor the 
progress of science.  How such a notion originated is not easily 
explained.  She has always, indeed, taught that preparation for a happy 
eternity is more important than the leading of easy and comfortable 
lives; hence the knowledge of those things that lead to Heaven is of 
more value than anything pertaining to earthly perfection.  In the ages 
of faith men were more anxious to lead good lives than to make progress 
in worldly affairs, and in this way it came to pass that they did not 
devote themselves to the natural sciences as much as men who have no 
thought of religion and no solicitude for the hereafter.  If this be 
opposition to the progress of science, then all right-minded believers 
must plead guilty of the crime with which the Church is charged.<p> 

The Church, too, frequently has reminded scientists that they should 
confine themselves to their own field of investigation; that they 
should not speak and act as if there were no light in Heaven or on 
earth except the light of their little lamps.  She has told them that 
they have no right to begin their investigations with the supposition 
that there is no God, that there is no such thing as revelation, that 
the first chapter of Genesis contains a false account of the creation 
of the world.  She has also told them that they must not jump at 
conclusions in the course of their investigations; but those words of 
advice and caution cannot be construed into opposition to the progress 
of science.  They have never been understood in this sense by her own 
children, and assuredly they ought to know her intentions better than 
outsiders.<p>

That the Church gladly welcomes any light that science may afford to 
aid in the explanation and defence of revealed truth is well-known to 
all who read the theological or scriptural treatises of Catholic 
writers.  Our faith is not built on the claims of science; we believe 
certain truths, not because science teaches them, but because they have 
been revealed by the Author of all truth and of all science.  We know, 
however, that the Faith has nothing to fear from the claims of science; 
hence the Church favors the most complete scientific investigation, 
provided it be conducted in the proper spirit, with the desire of 
arriving at the truth.<p>

<A NAME="PiusI"><b>Pius IX.</b></a> -- Pius IX, in various allocutions 
and letters, especially in those addressed to the bishops and 
theologians of Germany, fully recognized the importance of scientific 
investigation, provided science did not go beyond its own sphere.  He 
foreshadowed the definitions of the Vatican Council on the relations of 
reason to faith; and we defy our adversaries to find in the decrees of 
that Council a single word in condemnation of any just claims of 
science.<p> 

<A NAME="LeoXI"><b>Leo XIII.</b></a> -- It is well-known that Leo XIII, 
in many of his official acts, particularly in his Encyclical on the 
Restoration of Christian Philosophy, and his letters on the study of 
history and of the Sacred Scriptures, encouraged and exhorted Catholics 
to apply themselves to the study of the sciences, because the Faith has 
nothing to fear and men might gain much from the light of scientific 
investigations.<p> 

Let us pass over these words of advice and instruction, because some 
might say: These are recent acts; they are the words of progressive 
pontiffs; but it was not always thus, and the attitude of Rome was not 
always favorable to the natural sciences.  Now, we know that Rome never 
changes in matters of faith or doctrine.  But, in order to show that 
there is absolutely no ground for claiming that the Church was at any 
time opposed to scientific investigation, let us turn to the spectacle 
presented in the Middle Ages.<p>

<A NAME="Thirt"><b>Thirteenth Century.</b></a> -- What do we find in 
the thirteenth century, when the influence of the Church was paramount?  
We find that the greatest theologians of those days were also the most 
skillful scientists.  Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon are justly 
classed amongst the greatest scientists of any age; and it must not be 
supposed that they stand alone amongst the churchmen who were 
proficient in the natural sciences.  They are the best-known and most 
illustrious representatives of a school of men who strove to acquire 
eminence in all branches of knowledge.  The history of those schools 
and of those men stands before the world as a continual refutation of 
the calumnious assertion that the Church is opposed to the cultivation 
of the natural sciences.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n22">[22]</a><p> 

<A NAME="TimeN"><b>Time Necessary for Proficiency in the Natural 
Sciences.</b></a> -- In forming an estimate of their skill and 
proficiency we must bear in mind that the science of nature, like every 
other branch of human knowledge, was subject to the general law of 
evolution, or gradual development.  There was the time of incipiency, 
or growth and progress before the time of perfection.  Absolute 
perfection in this branch of knowledge will never be attained by man, 
because nature has many secrets which we shall never know, and it would 
be unfair to demand of men who lived six centuries ago that perfection 
of science which is easily attained by the specialists of our day.  
Just think of the wondrous changes wrought by the inventions and 
discoveries of scientists during the nineteenth century!  We do not 
blame men of the eighteenth century, or consider them ignorant, because 
they did not ride in automobiles or in Pullman cars lighted by 
electricity.  We do not consider ourselves unprogresssive because we 
cannot journey in twenty-four hours from New York to London in an 
airship.  In like manner we should not condemn men of the Middle Ages 
if they fall short of the twentieth century standard of perfection in 
the natural sciences.  We can require of them only a relative 
perfection, such proficiency as they could have attained, considering 
the time when they lived and the opportunities afforded them of making 
progress in the branches which depend so much on observation and 
experiment.<p> 

<A NAME="TWOGR ">TWO GREAT MEDIEVAL SCIENTISTS.</a> -- Judged by this 
standard the achievements of Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon are simply 
marvellous; and it is not surprising that they were regarded with a 
feeling akin to superstition whilst they were living, or that legends 
were intermingled with the true accounts of their scientific 
experiments and accomplishments.  The only serious criticism directed 
against them consisted in saying that they exaggerated the importance 
of philosophy and the natural sciences to the detriment of theological 
studies.  Here the critics are guilty of exaggeration.<p> 

Albertus Magnus was a great theologian, and he it was who moulded the 
mind of the greatest of all theologians, St. Thomas of 
Aquin.  According to the opinion of some writers, Roger Bacon did 
become so absorbed in the pursuit of natural sciences as to neglect 
certain branches of theology; but we must remember that only men of 
exceptional geniuis can become specialists in several branches.  In 
truth, he probably gave more time than his critics to the study of 
theology; and, even if he were too enthusiastic in his favorite study, 
we should be willing to pardon the fault, as we are inclined to 
rejoice rather than grieve over his successful pursuit of the natural 
sciences.<p>

These two remarkable men were contemporaries.  Albertus was born in 
1193 (according to some authorities in 1206), and died in 1280.  Bacon 
was born in 1214 and died in 1294.  They were Christian scientists in 
the true sense of the word, and they are entitled to the gratitude of 
the world for proving by their careers that a <i>good Christian can be 
a great scientist.</i>  The question was as actual in the thirteenth 
century as it is to-day, with this difference, that the theories then 
advanced in the name of science were more primitive, and perhaps more 
unreasonable, than modern scientific theories, though one needs strong 
faith to accept without doubting all that now passes under the name of 
science.<p>

Natural science, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, was looked 
upon with suspicion because it was presented under the garb of Arabian 
Aristotelianism.  Students of the universities seized with avidity 
everything that was presented in the name of science; sound judgment 
forbade the acceptance of all the foolish assertions of the alchemists 
and astrologers; the uninitiated either became superstitious or looked 
upon the philosophers as harmless dreamers; the educated scented danger 
to the faith from the writings of a pagan philosopher explained by the 
unbelieving Moors; the study of Aristotle's Physics was forbidden 
because false and dangerous systems were based upon the Stagyrite's 
works.  The world of students was thrown into confusion, and a 
master-mind was needed to establish order in the chaos of conflicting 
opinions and tendencies.<p>

<A NAME="Alber"><b>Albert the Great</b>.</a> -- That master-mind was 
Albertus Magnus, who is eulogized in an old Belgian Chronicle as 
<i>Magnus in magia, major in philosophia, maximus in theologia</i> 
(i.e., "Great in magic [natural sciences], greater in philosophy, 
greatest in theology").  He led the way for St. Thomas, who walked in 
the footsteps of  his master when he resolved to Christianize 
philosophy and systematize theology, accepting what was true and 
rejecting what was false in the writings of Aristotle.  In variety and 
extent of knowledge, and in soundness of judgment, the disciple 
surpassed the master, but Albert was the leader, and his first works 
were commentaries on the philosophy of Aristotle, which embraced the 
whole range of the natural sciences.<p> 

Albert the Great is undoubtedly one of the greatest men that ever 
lived.  The history of his career as a student at Paris, Padua, and 
Bologna, as a Dominican friar, and as professor at Hildesheim, 
Freiburg, Ratisbon, Strasburg, Paris and Cologne, as Provincial of his 
Order, and as Bishop of Ratisbon, would lead one to think that the 
active duties of the offices which he filled and the long journeys 
which he was compelled to make in those days of slow travelling, would 
leave him no time for writing; yet he has left "twenty-one folio 
volumes upon every then known subject that can be put under logic, 
metaphysics, psychology, natural science, ethics, theology, chemistry, 
botany, and the rest."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n23">[23]</a>  Commentaries 
on almost all the works of Aristotle; Natural Philosophy; Commentaries 
on Denis the Areopagite; Commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard; 
Summa Theologica, or Manual of Theology -- these are the headings under 
which we may classify the writings of the man who has merited the title 
of <i>Doctor Universalis,</i> the Universal Doctor.<p> 

<A NAME="Albe2"><b>Albert's Scientific Knowledge</b>.</a> -- We are 
dealing with his treatment of the natural sciences, and let us first 
separate true history from the legends that have been woven around his 
name.  It is certain that he was remarkable as a botanist, chemist, 
geographer, geologist, mechanic, and anatomist.<p> 

"Albertus Magnus," writes Humboldt in his "Cosmos," was equally active 
and influential in promoting the study of natural science and of the 
Aristotelian philosophy. . . .  His works contain some exceedingly 
acute remarks on the organic structure and physiology of plants.  One 
of his works, bearing the title of 'Liber Cosmographicus de Natura 
Locorum,' is a species of physical geography.  I have found in it 
considerations on the dependence of temperature concurrently with 
latitude and elevation, and on the effect of different angles of 
incidence of the sun's rays in heating the ground, which have excited 
my surprise."  Some writers assert that Albert could make gunpowder, 
and that as a geographer he anticipated the discovery of America.<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n24">[24]</a>  "The Jews looked upon his writings 
and discoveries with respect.  A certain Abraham translated into Arabic 
his <i>Summa</i> of natural philosophy; while the learned Jewish 
physician, Portaleone (1542-1612), pays a handsome compliment to 
Albert's treatment of 'precious stones.'"<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n25">[25]</a>  Augusta Theodosia Drane (Mother 
Raphael, O.S.D.), in her work on "Christian Schools and Scholars" 
(London, 1881), calls attention to a few of the scientific views of 
Albert which show how much he owed to his own sagacious observation of 
natural phenomena, and how far he was in advance of his age.<p> 

"He decides that the Milky Way is nothing but a vast assemblage of 
stars, but supposes, naturally enough, that they occupy the orbit which 
receives the light of the sun.  The figures visible on the moon's disk 
are not, he says, as had hitherto been supposed, reflections of the 
seas and mountains of the earth, but configurations of her own surface.  
He notices, in order to correct it, the assertion of Aristotle that 
lunar rainbows appear only twice in fifty years.  'I myself,' he says, 
'have observed two in a single year.'  He has something to say on the 
refraction of the solar ray, notices certain crystals which have a 
power of refraction, and remarks that none of the ancients, and few 
moderns, were acquainted with the properties of mirrors.  In his tenth 
book, wherein he catalogues and describes all the trees, plants, and 
herbs known in his time, he observes, 'all that is here set down is the 
result of our own experience, or has been borrowed from authors whom we 
know to have written what their personal experience confirmed; for in 
these matters experience alone can give certainty.'  (<i>Experimentum 
solum certificat de talibus.</i>)  Such an expression, which might have 
proceeded from the pen of Bacon, argues in itself a prodigious 
scientific progress and shows the medieval friar was on the track so 
successfully pursued by modern natural philosophy.  He had fairly 
shaken off the shackels which had hitherto tied up discovery and was 
the slave neither of Pliny nor of Aristotle.<p>

"He treats as fabulous the commonly received idea in which Bede had 
acquiesced, that the region of the earth south of the equator was 
uninhabitable, and considers that, from the equator to the south pole, 
the earth was not only habitable, but, in all probability, actually 
inhabited, except directly at the poles, where he imagines the cold to 
be excessive.  If there are any animals there, he says, they must have 
thick skins to defend them from the rigour of the climate, and are 
probably of a <i>white color</i>.  The intensity of cold, however, is 
tempered by the action of the sea.  He describes the antipodes and the 
counties they comprise, and divides the climate of the earth into seven 
zones.  He smiles with a scholar's freedom at the simplicity of those 
who suppose that persons living at the opposite extreme of the earth 
must fall off -- an opinion which can only arise out of the grossest 
ignorance -- 'for, when we speak of the <i>lower</i> hemisphere, this 
must be understood merely as relative to ourselves.'  It is as a 
geographer that Albert's superiority to the writers of his own time 
chiefly appears.  Bearing in mind the astonishing ignorance which then 
prevailed on this subject, it is truly admirable to find him correctly 
tracing the chief mountain chains of Europe, with the rivers which take 
their source in each, remarking on portions of coast which have in 
later times been submerged by the ocean, and islands which have been 
raised, by volcanic action, above the level of the sea, noticing the 
modification of climate caused by mountains, seas, and forests; and the 
divisions of the human race, whose differences he ascribes to the 
effect of the countries they inhabit.  In speaking of the British 
Isles, he alludes to the commonly received idea that another distant 
island, called Tile or Thule, existed far in the Western Ocean, 
uninhabitable by reason of its frightful climate, but which, he says, 
has perhaps not yet been visited by men.  He was acquainted with the 
sleep of plants; with the periodical opening and closing of blossoms; 
with the diminution of sap during evaporation from the cuticle of the 
leaves, and with the influence of the distribution of the bundles of 
vessels on the folial indentations.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n26">[26]</a>  
His minute observations on the forms and variety of plants indicate an 
exquisite sense of floral beauty.  He distinguishes the star from the 
bell flower, tells us that a red rose will turn white when submitted to 
the vapour of sulphur, and makes some very sagacious observations on 
the subject of germination.  The extraordinary erudition and 
originality of this treatise has drawn from M. Meyer the following 
comment: 'No botanist who lived before Albert can be compared to him, 
unless it be Theophrastus, with whom he was not acquainted; after him 
none has painted nature in such living colours, or studied it so 
profoundly, until the time of Conrad, Gesner, and Cesalpini.  All 
honour, then, to the man who made such astonishing progress in the 
science of nature as to find no one, I will not say to surpass, but 
even to equal him, for the space of three centuries.' . . . It was not 
extraordinary that one who had so deeply studied nature, and had 
mastered so many of her secrets, should by his wondering contemporaries 
have been judged to have owed his marvellous knowledge to a 
supernatural source, or that his mechanical contrivances, his knowledge 
of the power of mirrors, and his production of a winter garden, or 
hothouse, where, on the feast of the Epiphany, 1249, he exhibited to 
William of Holland, king of the Romans, plants and trees in full 
blossom, should have subjected him in the mind of the vulgar to the 
suspicion of sorcery."<p> 

<A NAME="Legen"><b>Legends about Albert</b>.</a> -- From the legends 
associated with the name of Albert we may select three as worthy of 
mention.<p> 

(1) There is the popular tradition that Albert furnished the plans for 
the Cathedral of Cologne.  Dr. Sighard,<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n27">[27]</a> an enthusiastic admirer of the great 
man, says that it is impossible to attribute to him the design of the 
Cologne basilica.  Probably, he was invited to take part in the 
deliberations with regard to the edifice, and may have spoken in favor 
of the wonders he had seen in Paris, and of the Gothic style of 
architecture, which had been adopted in almost all the Dominican 
churches; but he had no opportunity to gain such an insight into the 
artistic and practical details of architecture as was possessed by the 
author of Cologne's great cathedral.  Vaughan says "As an architect he 
gave plans for several churches; and the first design of the stately 
Cathedral of Cologne is said to have been copied from his drawings."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n28">[28]</a><p> 

(2) Another legend relates to an automaton that he labored thirty year 
to produce, which he succeeded in making to speak.  St. Thomas, the 
legend says, came unawares upon it in the workshop of Albert, and was 
so startled that he seized a stick, and shrieking <i>Salve! Salve!</i> 
smashed the fearful monster to pieces, thinking it to be some cruel 
savage who was about to attempt his life.  The truth is this: Albert 
could manufacture automata, which were made to move by means of 
mercury, after the manner of Chinese mannikins and tumbling-toys; and 
it is possible that he may have constructed small mechanical figures 
capable of emitting sounds, for he speaks of these inventions as things 
then known.  "The Barbiton," he says, "is a figure with a long beard, 
from the mouth of which comes a tube, with a bellows attached to one 
side.  It is set in motion by the introduction of air into the tube, so 
that the bearded mannikin appears to play the flute."  Albert probably 
manufactured an automaton of this kind, capable of moving and uttering 
the word <i>Salve</i>, so that the legend about St. Thomas's vigorous 
application of the stick is founded upon a historical fact.<p>

(3) Finally, wonderful things are told of Albert's <i>magic cup</i>, 
which is still preserved in the museum of Cologne.  "It is," writes Dr. 
Sighart, "an ordinary cup, the recess of which is formed of two plates 
of metal, the upper part being perforated.  Antimony (antimonium) was 
placed between the plates.  When water was poured into it, a portion of 
the antimony slowly dissolved, and the beverage had a laxitive effect.  
In wine, the dissolution was greater, and the liquid excited vomiting.  
Albert thus possessed a universal medicine; he could employ the two 
principal processes of the medical art, and there is no doubt that by 
this means he wrought the cure of many sick persons."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n29">[29]</a>  Sighart adds that most of the 
convents in Bavaria possessed, until recent times, cups of this 
description.<p> 

It is not surprising, then, that Albert should have been regarded by 
the common people as a magician or sorcerer, just as in our times 
people wondered whether Herman and Kellar possessed any secret methods 
of doing their remarkable "tricks."  "But is is certainly surprising," 
writes Mother Drane, "that such charges should be reproduced by modern 
critics, who, it might have been thought, would have condemned the very 
belief in witchcraft as a medieval superstition.  The more so as Albert 
devotes no inconsiderable portion of his pages to the exposure and 
refutation of those forbidden arts, which he will not allow to be 
reckoned among the sciences, such as geomancy, chiromancy, and a 
formidable list of other branches of magic."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n">[30]</a><p> 

<b>Roger Bacon</b>. - The Franciscan, Roger Bacon, was a contemporary
of Albertus Magnus, and devoted himself more exclusively
than the <i>Doctor Universalis</i> to the natural sciences.
Albert is greater as a metaphysician and theologian; Bacon 
merited the title of <i>Doctor Mirabilis</i> (Wonderful Doctor), by
the success of his studies and experiments in nature.  He cannot
justly be regarded as the founder of the experimental school of
philosophy, since all good philosophers recognized the importance
of observation and experiment as a means of arriving at the
knowledge of the truth, and before his time many had distinguished
themselves by the acuteness of their observations and
the success of their experiments.  Bacon urged more earnestly
than any of his predecessors or contemporaries the necessity of 
the experimental method, and has been reproached with the 
neglect of philosophy and theology.  Let us remember that he 
had received the degree of Doctor in Theology from the University
of Paris.  Returning to Oxford, he spent forty years of
his life in studying and lecturing on the natural sciences.  He
thus became a specialist, and we must not be surprised to find him
enthusiastic and exaggerated in his devotion to this branch of
study.  Humboldt says that he was the most important cultivator
of the natural sciences who appeared during the Middle Ages.<p>

<A NAME="Writi"><b>Writings of Bacon.</b></a> -- His writings included 
treatises on optics (then called perspective), mathematics, chemistry, 
arithmetic, astronomy, the tides, and the reformation of the calendar.  
His skill in the use of optical and mechanical instruments caused him 
to be regarded by many as a sorcerer.  He was acquainted with the 
properties of mirrors, knew the powers of steam and gunpowder, knew 
something about the microscope, and possessed an instrument very much 
like our telescope.  He claimed for this tube that it would make the 
most distant object appear near, that it would make stars appear at 
will, and, what is more, that it had the power of beholding future 
events.  This was an exaggeration, to say the least, unless we suppose 
that the wonderful friar, with the aid of his tube, could fortell 
storms and hot and cold waves, as our weather bureau does.<p> 

Devotion to his favorite science led Bacon into the wild theories of 
the alchemists.  "He believed in the possibility of contriving lamps 
that should burn forever, magic crystals, the elixir of life, and the 
philosopher's stone, and wrote treatises on the two last-named 
subjects."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n31">[31]</a><p> 

Notwithstanding these errors, which are excusable in one 
who lived six hundred hears ago, Montalembert wrote of Bacon:
"He rehabilitated and sanctified the study of nature; he classified
all the sciences and foresaw (if he did not accomplish), the
greatest discoveries of modern times."  Suspension bridges
(<i>Pontes ultra flumina, sine columna vel aliquo sustentaculo</i>),
diving-bells and flying machines, were amongst the possibilities
he predicted.  He did not know Santos-Dumont, Curtiss, or the
Wright brothers, but he wrote that it was possible to make a
contrivance, by which a man, sitting in the middle of an airship,
could, by turning a crank, move artificial wings, and sail through 
the air like a bird.  (<i>Instrumenta volandi, ut homo, sedens in
medio instrumenti, revolvens aliquod instrumentum, per quod 
alae artificialiter compositae aerum verberant, ad modum avis 
volant</i>.)<p>

We are not told whether it was the lack of a ship, Bacon's
own prudence, or the vigilence of his superiors, that prevented
him from "going up in the air"; but we are glad that he did not
experiment too much with his flying machine; otherwise his fate
would have been worse than that of Albertus Magnus' automaton,
which was broken to pieces by St. Thomas.<p>

Bacon was also a philologist, and, in his enthusiasm for the
study of languages, he held that all Christians should know
the Scriptures thoroughly, and be able to consult the Hebrew
and Greek manuscripts.  When it was objected that this was not
possible, he replied that he had invented a universal grammar,
with the aid of which he could teach any man Hebrew, Greek,
Latin, and Arabic in a few days.  He also boasted that he could
teach the whole course of arithmetic and geometry in a week.
These are exaggerations which must be attributed to his
enthusiasm and to the facility with which he himself acquired
knowledge.  They will be pardoned in one who has done do much
to prove that the Middle Ages were far from being buried in the
darkness of ignorance and superstition.<p>

In the course of these studies mention is made of men who
were eminent in learning in every age from the beginning of
the ninth to the end of the thirteenth century.  Some of them
were the greatest and most learned men that the world ever
knew; some were led into fanciful theories and dangerous errors;
but the history of these men and of their times gives evidence of
a desire for knowledge and of intellectual activity that has never
been surpassed, even in our own days of boasted enlightenments!
Why, then, should those centuries be called the "dark ages"?  In
the highest branches of human knowledge, sound philosophy and
intelligent theology, the Scholastics are still the leaders, and their
works are to this day the best models we possess of true science.<p>

In the experimental sciences Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon were 
far in advance of their times, and many of their
opinions are regarded with respectful admiration by the scientists
of to-day.  In the name of truth, then, and in the name of all
that is fair and decent, let men cease to say or to insinuate that
the Church is opposed to science or to true knowledge of any
kind.  Believers may search and investigate nature as much as
they will, provided they do not try to shut out the light which
Heaven gives to guide them in their investigations; and their
faith will be strengthened.  Unbelievers, too, may search as they
will.  Their investigations alone may not lead them to the faith,
which is based on the word of God, but we can assure them that
in all their investigations they will never find the least 
foundation for opposition to revelation; for revelation is the light of
God, and there can be no opposition between the light of science
and the light of God.  Both dispel darkness, and both should
always point out the way that leads to the bright, eternal Light
of Lights.<p>
