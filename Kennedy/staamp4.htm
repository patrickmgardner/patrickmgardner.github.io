<H1>Condition of Philosophy in the Thirteenth Century 
-- What St. Thomas Found at Paris</h1> 

<A NAME="STTHO">ST. THOMAS GOES TO PARIS.</a> -- In the year 1245, 
sometime between Easter and the midsummer, two travellers might have 
been seen trudging patiently and cheerfully along one of the many 
roads, not so numerous, indeed, then as now, but more picturesque in 
the grandeur of their natural beauty, which led out from the city of 
Cologne.  They travelled on foot, carried no provisions and had 
"neither purse nor scrip."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n32">[32]</a>  They 
were mendicant friars, journeying in truly apostolic fashion from 
Cologne to Paris, in obedience to the commands of the general chapter 
of the Order of St. Dominic, which was held that year at Cologne.<p> 

In those days it was not uncommon to see religious thus journeying from 
place to place, and our two friars would not have attracted special 
attention unless, perhaps, something of the nobility and greatness and 
sanctity of their souls manifested itself in their countenances.  
Historians, however, would give much to know what were their thoughts 
and what words were exchanged between them as they journeyed along, 
interrupting their prayers and meditations to converse about the 
mission on which they were sent and the plans of their superiors, which 
they were preparing to execute.  <i>Cognitio singularium non perficit 
intellectum,</i> is a principle laid down by St. Thomas.<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n33">[33]</a>  History is useless unless it teach 
something: the knowledge of what those who have gone before us said or 
did is worthless, unless it fill our minds with principles which will 
serve as beacon-lights, pointing out the efforts, the dangers, the 
successes of the past, throwing light on the paths in which we must 
walk in the future.  Ordinarily the sayings and doings of others are of 
no value, except in as far as they furnish subjects of amusement or 
occupation for those who might be doing something worse if they were 
not engaged in idle gossip; but the thoughts and sayings and the deeds 
of those who were truly great, and who exercised a salutary influence 
on their contemporaries and on future ages, must be carefully studied 
by all who wish to understand the philosophy of history.  Of our two 
travelling friars it may be said without exaggeration that they were 
starting on a mission which was to change the face of the world; not 
indeed by conquests gained with the sword, but by triumphs of the pen, 
which they were to wield so assiduously and so mightily in the service 
of God and religion.<p> 

<A NAME="Alber"><b>Albertus Magnus and St. Thomas Practical 
Men.</b></a> -- The two travelling friars were Albertus Magnus and 
Thomas Aquinas.  We often think and speak of the saints and of great 
men as if they were like wax figures or automata, or men who lived and 
moved in a dream-land, forgetting that in reality they were warm-
hearted, practical men.  They were not angels, although the sublimity 
of their thoughts and the purity of their lives made them angelic, and 
this is in a special manner true of St. Thomas.  They were <i>men</i>, 
living in the world, with temptations to overcome and duties to face.  
They did not always move about as if they were in a trance; they were 
not, either by virtue of necessity or by necessity of virtue, 
unpractical.  They lived, indeed, in a sphere elevated above that 
occupied by the generality of mankind.  Owing to the elevation in which 
they were placed they could survey with calmness and with cool, 
unbiased judgment, the strifes and turmoils that raged beneath them; 
but we must not forget that they were intelligent, and warm-hearted 
men; not indeed in the sense that they yielded to the vices or 
weaknesses which often prove but too forcibly the reality of our 
tainted nature, but in the sense that they did not go through the world 
stupidly or with their eyes closed.  They were alive to the times in 
which they lived, being ready to recognize the good and to apply a 
remedy to the evils which came under their intelligent observation.<p> 

There is no reason, then, for supposing that Bl. Albert and St. Thomas 
journeyed from Cologne to Paris without conferring together in regard 
to their plans for the future.  Moreover, they had serious matters to 
discuss.  Humility is not stupidity, and they would have been stupid if 
they did not understand that the  superiors of the Order had something 
important in view when the general chapter, held at Cologne in 1245, 
decreed that Albert should be sent to Paris to take the Doctor's cap 
and that he was to be accompanied by his young disciple, Thomas of 
Aquin, whom the General of the Order had brought all the way from 
Naples to Cologne that he might be trained under the care of one who 
was generally known as "the great professor."  They knew that the Order 
of St. Dominic from its very beginning had been devoted to the study of 
the sacred sciences.  Albert himself had been sent to Paris in the year 
1228 "to look thoroughly into the studies and to put them on a footing 
to meet the requirements of the age."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n34">[34]</a>  Many students and professors of the 
university had joined the new institution, and the general chapters 
each year made new regulations to perfect the system of studies and of 
graduation which was to produce such excellent results in the near and 
the distant future.  They had too much humility to consider themselves 
more important than other professors and students of the order, but 
they must have felt that the trust which the order reposed in them 
carried with it a responsibility which had not been imposed upon the 
others.  Bl. Albert and St. Thomas had learned to know each other at 
Cologne, and a strong, saintly affection had sprung up between the 
master and his favorite disciple.  The young novice was so meditative 
and silent that his companions called him a dumb ox.  Albert discovered 
the talent of the big, silent student, and ever afterwards his greatest 
care was to nurture, develop and direct the talent of the youth, 
concerning whom he had exclaimed in prophetic admiration;  "We call 
this young man a dumb ox, but so loud will be his bellowing in doctrine 
that it will resound throughout the world."<p> 

When they went together to Paris, Albert was about fifty-two years of 
age, and he knew from experience something of the remarkable 
intellectual activity which has caused the thirteenth century to be 
called "the classical epoch of the Middle Ages."  He had studied at 
Paris, at Padua and at Bologna; had lectured in various cities on the 
works of Aristotle and on the Scriptures.  People went in crowds to 
hear him and looked upon him as a prodigy of learning.  In truth he was 
one of the glories of the Middle Ages, and he could tell his young 
pupil much about the professors and students of Paris, and of the other 
universities in which he had studied, or which he had visited.<p>

<A NAME="THEUN">THE UNIVERSITY OF PARIS.</a> -- Paris by this time 
had become the first philosophical and theological school of the world, 
and her university was the most important of the many excellent 
universities which were much more numerous in those days than is 
generally supposed by those who know nothing about this period except 
what they read in the works of prejudiced authors.<p> 

The very importance of the university to which professors and students 
flocked from all parts of the world, became the occasion of many 
disorders; for, where there were so many gathered together, fired with 
ambition and enjoying the privileges which were lavished on teachers 
and students, it was but natural for youth to become relaxed, and for 
the professors to become haughty, ambitious and anxious to acquire a 
great name by upsetting old theories and introducing new doctrine.<p>

Of these dangers and dangerous doctrines did Albert speak to Brother 
Thomas, then about twenty years of age, as he brought to Paris the 
young Count of Aquino, who was to become the brightest light of the 
Paris University, and the greatest theologian of the Catholic church.<p>

The story of St. Thomas' vocation to the Order of St. Dominic, and of 
the violent opposition of his mother and brother is well known.<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n34a">[34a]</a>  His mother was ambitious to have her 
son become abbot of the celebrated Benedictine monastery of Monte 
Cassino, under the shadow of which he was born and within whose walls 
seven years of his boyhood had been spent.  She was, therefore, very 
much disappointed when her son, who had been sent to study at Naples, 
received the habit of the Friars Preachers.  The constancy of Thomas 
triumphed over all opposition, and he made his profession in the 
convent of Naples, whence he was soon afterwards transferred to 
Cologne, passing through Paris on the journey, in company with John the 
Teuton, who was master-general of the Order.  His course of studies had 
not been completed when, in 1245, Albert was ordered to Paris to take 
the Doctor's cap and Thomas was sent with him to continue his studies 
under the greatest master of the age.<p> 

<A NAME="WhatS"><b>What St. Thomas Found at Paris.</b></a> -- What did 
St. Thomas find at Paris?  An answer to this question must be given 
before we can understand his influence on religious thought.  A 
complete and perfectly satisfactory answer cannot be given in the space 
of one article, and from the innumerable topics that might be treated 
the most important only will be selected with a view to establishing 
the following proposition:  The thirteenth century needed a learned and 
saintly man to <i>Christianize philosophy</i> and to <i>systemize 
theology</i>.  This was the life work of St. Thomas, whom Cardinal 
Bessarion called "the most saintly of learned men and the most learned 
of the saints."  Because he accomplished this gigantic task in such a 
perfect manner that down to our own times no improvement has been made 
on his work, except in the acts of the Councils of the Church, which is 
always guided by the Holy Ghost, Leo XIII, adding new words of praise 
to the many enconmiums which had been heaped upon the name of St. 
Thomas by his predecessors, proposed the Angel of the Schools as the 
model teacher and Doctor, and appointed him to be the special patron of 
all Catholic schools, colleges, and universities throughtout the 
world.<p> 

<A NAME="THETH">THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY.</a> -- Pope Leo XIII did 
many things which astonished the non-thinking people of our age.  He 
was known to be a learned scholar as well as a saintly man.  He was 
revered and even loved by many non-Catholics, and for this reason his 
acts have not been severely criticised; but outsiders must be puzzled 
to know why this enlightened nineteenth century pope so repeatedly 
called his children back to the standard of the thirteenth century, as 
he did in several of his immortal encyclicals, especially in his 
Letters on the Rosary, on the Restoration of Scholastic Philosophy, on 
the Christian Constitution of States, and on the Condition of the 
Working Classes.  Many persons will be suprised to learn that the 
thirteenth century deserves to be called a golden age in the history of 
the world.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n35">[35]</a>  When St. Thomas went to 
Paris it was the most important centre of learning in the world, and 
was particularly noted as a school of theology.  Here, as elsewhere, 
the Christian schools and episcopal seminaries had become the 
foundations of universities.  The change had been brought about so 
gradually that it is very difficult to assign the exact date of the 
foundation of the University of Paris.  We know that in 1215, Innocent 
III, who had studied at Paris, gave to his Alma Mater a body of 
academic statutes, and from that day forward it was in a special manner 
under the protection of the Roman Pontiffs; but this act of Pope 
Innocent supposes that the University had been established.<p> 

A. T. Drane, in her "Christian Schools and Scholars," says that 1200 
was the date of the formal recognition of the University.  Church and 
state vied with each other in encouraging and assisting both professors 
and students, and the University of Paris could at one time boast of 
forty thousand students gathered within its walls from all parts of the 
world.<p>

<A NAME="Intel"><b>Intellectual Activity and Progress.</b></a> -- In 
the thirteenth century the human race attained the summit of 
intellectual greatness.  Before that time Plato and Aristotle had 
carried human reason as high as unaided reason could go; but they were 
pagans and, great as they undoubtedly were, they made many mistakes.  
The study of their works will convince any candid mind of a truth which 
was defined by the Vatican Council, viz., that revelation is necessary 
for the human race in its present condition, in order that even those 
truths about things divine which of themselves are not beyond reason 
may be known in a short time, by all, with certitude and without 
error.<p> 

In the thirteenth century intellectual progress, under the guidance of 
faith, had reached that point where it could be said with truth:  
"Reason could go no higher; faith could not receive more numerous or 
stronger arguments from reason to explain and defend her dogmas."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n36">[36]</a>  This perfection was attained only 
after St. Thomas had lived and had written his immortal <i>Summa</i>.  
This is the great accomplishment which, according to Leo XIII, made St. 
Thomas the prince of all Christian philosophers.  Towards this object 
were directed, under the the guidance of Providence, the mightly 
efforts made in those times for the progress of mankind in all branches 
of knowledge.  Paris, Bologna, Padua, Toulouse, Montpelier, Bordeaux, 
Siena, Bourges, Orleans, Salamanca, Valladolid, Vienna, Heidelberg, 
Cologne, Oxford, and Cambridge -- to say nothing of less important 
places -- are indebted for their universities and for their renown as 
seats of learning to that grand movement of intellectual activity which 
was at its height in the thirteenth century, and which continued in the 
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, so that, before the period of the 
Reformation, sixty-six such institutions had been founded in various 
European countries.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n37">[37]</a><p> 

The world was progressing rapidly.  Man is naturally inquisitive, 
anxious to know; hence there has always been an effort to establish 
schools and to perfect methods of training young minds.  The history of 
these schools in various countries, from the birth of Christianity, 
when St. Mark established the first Christian school in Alexandria, 
down to our own times, forms one of the brightest and most interesting 
pages in the history of the Catholic Church.<p>

In the thirteenth century men were no longer satisfied with the old 
Christian schools and seminaries.  For years the <i>Trivium,</i> i.e., 
grammar, logic, and rhetoric, had formed the standard of perfection for 
the ordinary schools, whilst the higher schools taught the 
<i>Quadrivium,</i> which embraced arithmetic, geometry, music and 
astronomy.  To these was added in the episcopal seminaries a practical 
training in chant and the liturgy, together with the study of the 
Scriptures.<p>

In the thirteenth century men wanted something higher; they wanted a 
university, i.e., "an aggregation of schools governed by a body of 
Doctors, who divide among themselves the several branches of 
instruction which, in the public schools, are united under one 
master."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n38">[38]</a>  In other words, instead of 
having all branches taught by one man, who was supposed to know almost 
everything, they decided that it would be better to have a body of 
teachers, each one a specialist in his own branch, without being 
ignorant of other branches; hence they established the universities, 
the most illustrious of which was the University of Paris.<p> 

Why had not this idea been more fully realized before the thirteenth 
century?  Why were not our modern battleships built many centuries ago?  
Rome was not built in a day, and in like manner centuries passed before 
man had progressed up to the standards of the universities.
   
<A NAME="Schol"><b>Scholasticism.</b></a> -- Scholasticism can be 
traced from its rise in the ninth century to its perfection in the 
thirteenth.  The celebrities of the ninth century were Alcuin (735-
804), Rabanus Maurus (776-856), Scotus Erigena, Henry of Auxerre, and 
his pupil, Remigius, the first who publicly taught dialectics at Paris.  
Then came the tenth century, called the age of iron, because it was a 
time of sterility.  The eleventh century was noted for the disputes on 
the nature of the Universals, with the Nominalism of Roscelin, the 
exaggerated Realism of William of Champeaux, and the moderate Realism 
of St. Anselm, who also established the true principles on which reason 
should be proceed in her inquiries into the mysteries of revealed 
religion.  In the twelfth century there were many aberrations.  
Abelard, puffed up with pride and self-sufficiency, introduced a very 
dangerous species of Rationalism; Amaury de Bene and David of Dinant 
fell into Pantheism; Averroes and other Arabian philosophers gave out 
poisonous interpretations of Aristotle's works; whilst on the other 
hand, the justly celebrated Peter Lombard became the father of 
systematized theology by writing his famous "Book of the Sentences," 
which was the favorite text-book of the twelfth and thirteenth 
centuries, being afterwards replaced by the "Summa Theologiae" of 
Alexander of Hales, and finally, by the much more celebrated "Summa 
Theologica" of St. Thomas.  In the meantime, Hugh and Richard, sweet 
mystics of the school of St. Victor, had endeavored both by written 
words and saintly example to remind the world of scholars that, though 
Abelard was great in the eyes of men, his opponent, St. Bernard, was 
great in the eyes of God, that reason is at best but a weak instrument 
of knowledge, unless it be strengthened by faith, and that the science 
of the love of God was much more important than skill in dialectics and 
the art of syllogizing.<p> 

The grand intellectual movement which we are considering culminated in the 
glories of the thirteenth century, giving to the world first, William of 
Auvergne, Alexander of Hales (<i>Doctor Irrefragabilis</i>), Vincent of 
Beauvais, author of the famous <i>Specula</i> or Encyclopedia of all 
knowledge, Roger Bacon (<i> Doctor Mirabilis</i>), Henry of Ghent (<i>Doctor 
Solemnis</i>), and Raymond Lullus (<i>Doctor Illuminatus</i>), author of the 
<i>Ars Universalis</i> or <i>Ars Magna</i>, wherein he taught a universal 
method and classified all knowledge and all things known.<p>

These great minds constitute only the lesser lights of the thirteenth 
century.  They are eclipsed by the greater lights that came afterwards, 
Albertus Magnus, St. Thomas, St. Bonaventure, and Duns Scotus.  Here we have 
Scholasticism in the truest and best sense of the word -- reason applied to 
revelation, defending, systematizing, explaining and developing the 
mysteries of faith.<p>

<A NAME="Advan"><b>Advantages of the New System.</b></a> -- This 
universal mental activity and the system of studies to which it gave 
rise produced many desirable results, but it became at the same time 
the occasion of many evils, which were not suppressed in a day but were 
gradually crushed or extirpated, thanks to the vigilance of the bishops 
and to the influence of learned and saintly men who were raised up by 
Providence just at the time when they were most needed.  The task which 
confronted St. Thomas was that of discerning and determining what was 
good that he might exert his influence to promote and encourage it, and 
what was bad, that he might contend against it with all the force of 
his voice and pen.  Some were rash enough to cry out against the new 
system simply because it was a departure from the simplicity of ancient 
times.  They should have paused to think that the world will not remain 
stationary, and that many evils will always be found mixed in the 
beneficial results of rapid progress.  As a matter of fact the 
establishment of the universities, with the progress of the Scholastics 
in philosophy and theology, notwithstanding certain evils much 
deplored, conferred upon the world benefits which have produced 
salutary results even down to our own times.<p> 

The men of those times could give us lessons on methods of learning and 
the time that should be devoted to the acquisition of knowledge.  They 
did not make the mistake of supposing that a few years spent in a 
school and a few more spent in college made a man fit to enlighten the 
world and to propound luminous principles for the guidance of mankind.  
We know at least one scholar, John of Salisbury, the friend of St. 
Thomas &agrave; Becket, whose academic career extended over the space 
of twelve years, at the end of which time "he found himself possessed 
of a vast fund of erudition and an empty purse."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n39">[39]</a>  This was not, perhaps, the general 
rule, for John of Salisbury was the first scholar of his day, but it is 
certain that the system then followed required so much time as to draw 
from Fleury the remark that, "the system was excellent had its 
execution been possible; but life was too short to allow of a man's 
perfecting himself in every known branch of learning before entering on 
his theological studies."  According to the statutes of Innocent III, 
promulgated at Paris in 1215 by his legate, Robert de Cour&ccedil;on, 
no one was to profess the arts before the age of twenty-one, or without 
having previously studied for six years under some approved master.  To 
teach theology the statutes required that a man should be at least 
thirty-five years of age and that he should have studied under some 
approved master.<p> 

The rule was for a Bachelor to begin by explaining the Sentences in the 
school of some doctor for the space of a year.  At the end of that time he 
was presented to the chancellor of the cathedral of Paris, and if on 
examination he was judged worthy, he received a license and became 
Licentiate, until he was received as Doctor, when he opened a school of his 
own in which he explained the "Sentences" for another year.  At the end of 
that time he was allowed to receive some Bachelor under him.  The whole 
Doctor's course called for three years of teaching; nor could anyone take a 
degree unless he had taught according to these regulations.  It was this 
thorough course of studies wich produced the great doctors of the twelfth 
and thirteenth centuries.<p>

<A NAME="Unive"><b>University Colleges.</b></a> -- For training the 
intellect the system was perfect, but the discipline of the soul was 
sometimes neglected, and to guard against this evil, colleges were 
established where the young men were exercised in religious duties and 
enjoyed the benefit of a regular training, in order to preserve the 
purity of their morals in the midst of many dangers and temptations. 
All the religious orders -- the Trinitarians, Franciscans, Bernardines, 
Carmelites, Augustinians, Benedictines, Premonstratensians, Dominicans, 
and even the Carthusians and monks of Cluny -- had their colleges or 
houses, where their subjects lived and enjoyed the benefits of the 
university course without being exposed to the corrupting influences by 
which they were surrounded.<p> 

The bishops, in order to protect their students, imitated the example of the 
regulars, and established colleges which were to take the place of the 
episcopal seminaries.<p>

<A NAME="TheSo"><b>The Sorbonne.</b></a> -- The first and most famous 
of these colleges was the Sorbonne, named after its founder, Robert de 
Sorbon, who was chaplain to St. Louis.  This college, which was opened 
for the reception of secular students in 1253, was called by Crevier 
the greatest ornament of the university.  In time it came to be 
regarded as the first theological school in the world, and its name has 
often been applied to the University itself.<p> 

<A NAME="Evils"><b>Evils of the New System</b>.</a> -- Before the 
university and Scholasticism reached the perfection which they had 
attained when the Sorbonne was established there was a period of 
formation and of gradual growth and development during which, besides 
the lack of discipline and the corruption of morals, there existed 
other imperfections and evils against which thoughtful men of the day 
raised their voices and took up their pens.<p> 

<A NAME="Johno"><b>John of Salisbury and the "Cornificians."</b></a> -- 
John of Salisbury, in the twelfth century, complained bitterly that the 
study of dialectics and the prominence given to logical disputations 
had caused the neglect of good literature; and his caustic pen was ever 
ready to attack the "Cornificians," by which term he designated those 
who devoted themselves to philosophy rather than to the study of 
grammar, rhetoric, etc.  Some justification for his severe criticisms 
is to be found in the conduct of the dialecticians themselves.  They 
regarded logic and subtle reasoning as an end, not as a means of 
acquiring further knowledge.  They wasted their time and talents in 
discussing useless questions, and fell into many serious errors.<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n40">[40]</a><p> 

<A NAME="Ratio"><b>Rationalism in the Schools.</b></a> -- Before 
Scholastic criticism was introduced scholars were diligent readers more 
than profound thinkers.  They could tell what others had written on a 
subject, but they seldom investigated for themselves, and their 
writings were compilations rather than original compositions.  With the 
revival of philosophical studies men began to investigate for 
themselves; and it is not surprising that they soon went to the other 
extreme, with the result that there was introduced into the schools an 
insidious species of Rationalism which, without denying the mysteries 
of faith, contended that reason could prove and explain them.<p> 

<A NAME="Raymo"><b>Raymond Lullus.</b></a> -- Raymond Lullus 
(1235-1315), in a proposition which was condemned in 1376 by Gregory 
XI, asserted that "all articles of faith, and the sacraments of the 
Church can be proved and are proved by reasons which are demonstrative, 
necessary and evident."  Faith, he said, was necessary for rustics but 
not for philosophers, and reason is a safer guide than faith for 
knowing the things that are of faith.<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n41">[41]</a><p> 

<A NAME="Abela"><b>Abelard.</b></a> -- Raymond Lullus, however, did 
little more than re-echo the errors of one who had preceded him by more 
than a century, the celebrated and unfortunate Abelard (1079-1142), who 
enjoys the unenviable distinction of being the great champion of 
Scholastic Rationalism.  Abelard was talented and brilliant, but he 
lacked humility, and pride marred a career which might have been 
productive of much good to the Church.  He would not submit to 
authority; he would not even consent to be taught.  He attended the 
lectures of William of Champeaux, not with a desire to listen and to 
learn but with the secret design of shining before his fellow-students 
and perplexing his master by proposing subtle, vexatious questions, and 
soon set up an independent school, where he taught not only logic, but 
even Scripture and Theology.  This was against the established custom, 
according to which no scholar could teach who had not previously gone 
through a regular course of study under an approved master, and Abelard 
was really attempting to teach branches which he had never studied.  
Logic, in his hands, became not a means for acquiring the knowledge of 
truth, but an end; and he used it not for the purpose of knowing the 
truth but rather to prove that what others said was not true.  His 
brilliancy and wit attracted crowds of students, his pride became 
greater as his fame increased, and he soon attempted to explain the 
profoundest mysteries of faith by the light of reason.  To believe 
without doubting, he said, was the religion of women and children; to 
doubt all things before we believe them was alone worthy of the dignity 
of man, and proofs of the truths of revealed religion were to be 
furnished by reason.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n42">[42]</a><p> 

The school of St. Victor opposed the errors of Abelard.  St. Bernard emerged 
from the solitude of Citeaux to attack the new heresy and Abelard's treatise 
on the Holy Trinity was condemned at the Council of Soissons, and also at 
Sens in 1140.<p>

Abelard died a few years later, but the seeds of Rationalism which he 
had sown were to bear fruit after his death.  Crevier relates the story 
of Simon of Tournai, "who blasphemously boasted that it was as easy for 
him to disprove, as to prove the existence of God.  He offered to do so 
on the following day, but in the midst of his impious speech was struck 
with apoplexy, and the event was regarded as a manifestation of the 
Divine displeasure."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n43">[43]</a>  We have 
already seen that his errors were afterwards revived by Raymond Lullus, 
who lived from 1235 to 1315; and in the time of St. Thomas there was 
need of a master-mind to determine the true relations of faith and 
reason.<p> 

<A NAME="Averr"><b>Averroes.</b></a> -- Another false system which was 
introduced into Paris in the twelfth century, and which perhaps more 
than any other error of the times, exercised an influence on the 
writings of St. Thomas, was named after its author, Averroism.  
Averroes, the son of an Arabian physician, was born at Cordova, in the 
beginning of the twelfth century.  It is difficult to determine his 
religion since he scoffed alike at Christianity, Judaism, and 
Mohammedanism.  He is the most illustrious representative of the 
Moorish school of philosophy, and was remarkably well-versed in 
grammar, medicine, jurisprudence, philosophy and theology.  He is best 
known as the great "Commentator" on the works of Aristotle, and his 
works found their way to Paris at a time when there existed a veritable 
craze for the study of philosophy.  St. Thomas says that he was "not so 
much a Peripatetic as a perverter of Peripatetic philosophy." (<i>Non 
tam fuit Peripateticus quam peripateticae philosophiae 
depravator</i>.)<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n44">[44]</a>  In his works are 
to be found Rationalism, Pantheism, destruction of the human 
personality, and denial of the immortality of the individual soul.  
These errors cluster around one grand principle, viz., that all mankind 
has one common intellect.  This hypothesis was invented by the 
"Commentator" to explain the existence of universal ideas as found 
alike in all minds.  All men have the same ideas of a horse, a dog, an 
angel, a circle, a quadrangle, etc., and Averroes concluded from this 
that all men had one intellect.  It would be charitable to suppose that 
the Parisian doctors did not see the far-reaching conclusions of this 
pernicious doctrine, which they embraced with the avidity of men hungry 
for knowledge, being blinded and infatuated with the desire of 
singularity.  We find them teaching that after death all souls are 
merged in one, and thus that all distinction of reward and punishment 
would be impossible.<p> 

The love of novelty turned the heads of Christian philosophers, and 
professors of a Catholic university maintained such propositions as the 
following:  That the will is not free; that there is but one intellect 
for all men; that all lower things are under the necessary influence of 
the heavenly bodies; that God cannot bestow immortality; that the soul 
corrupts; that God does not know individual things; that the acts of 
men are not governed by a Divine Providence, and many other equally 
erroneous and startling.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n45">[45]</a> 
                                                                      
<A NAME="PANTH">PANTHEISM.</a> -- <B>Amaury de Bene.</b> -- Almaric 
(Amaury) de Bene (1205) publicly taught that human nature could be 
identified with the Divinity; that the Eternal Father became incarnate 
in Abraham, the Eternal Son in Mary, and the Holy Ghost in us, and that 
all things in reality are one because all things in reality are God.  
This was Averroistic pantheism.  Because all things are one in the mind 
of God, followers of Averroes concluded that the one intellect of all 
men was the intellect of God, and thus the distinction between God and 
His creatures soon vanished.<p> 

<A NAME="David"><b>David of Dinant.</b></a> -- David of Dinant taught 
that God is the primary substance of all things.  St. Thomas applies to 
this man's argument in support of his error one of the strongest 
expressions used in his "Summa," calling it very foolish 
(<i>stultissime posuit</i>).<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n46">[46]</a>  David 
taught that God and the first matter (<i>materia prima</i>) were 
identical, because since both were simple, there was nothing which 
could constitute a difference between them.  No, says St. Thomas, they 
are so far apart that there could not be such a slight distinction 
between them as a Scholastic difference (<i>differentia</i>); they are 
entirely diverse,<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n47">[47]</a> hence they cannot 
be identical.  Albertus Magnus, in his old age, took up his pen to 
write against these pernicious doctrines, which were promptly condemned 
by the Church.<p> 

<A NAME="Decre"><b>Decree Against Aristotle.</b></a> -- Radically to 
extirpate these evils it was determined at a Council held at Paris in 
1210 to forbid the study of Aristotle's Physics and Metaphysics.  The 
prohibition was afterwards modified by Gregory IX, but the evil had not 
been fully abated, and, before the end of the thirteenth century, the 
Parisian doctors again taught pagan errors.  "Even those who did not 
push the abuse to such extremes," says Crevier, "altered, at least in 
part, the purity of the Christian dogma by interpretations more 
conformable to the spirit of Aristotle than of the Fathers," and it was 
this evil more than any other which vitiated the Christian philosophy 
of the thirteenth century when St. Thomas went to Paris.<p> 

<A NAME="Remed"><b>Remedy for Evils.</b></a> -- Contemplating this sad 
state of affairs in the first theological school in the world, we may 
well ask:  What remedy did Providence apply to this great evil?  And 
the answer comes:  He sent into the world St. Thomas of Aquin, who was 
to regenerate philosophy and to become the Christian Aristotle.  How 
St. Thomas accomplished the task which Providence had prepared for him 
and for which he was providentially prepared will be more fully 
explained in another article.<p> 

<A NAME="Light"><b>Light in the Darkness.</b></a> -- Suffice it to say, 
for the present, that, with the discerning eye of a genius and of a 
saint, he surveyed the field, and soon determined in his own mind what 
course was to be pursued.  First he saw that it would be impossible, 
even if it were desirable, to suppress the general movement in favor of 
deep philosophical studies, which swept over the world as irresistibly 
as the tide of the mighty ocean advances to the seashore.<p> 

<A NAME="Arist"><b>Aristotle to be Christianized.</b></a> -- In the 
next place, he saw that the most deplorable errors of the times sprang 
from reading Aristotle as he was misrepresented by the Arabian 
commentators; and he knew well from his master, Albert, and from the 
writings of Boethius and St. Isidore of Seville, that the doctrines of 
the Stagyrite would not necessarily make a philosopher rationalistic, 
Averroistic, or pantheistic.  Cardinal Gonzalez, in his history of 
philosophy (Fr. tr., vol. II, p. 114), justly rejects the oft-repeated 
statement that Europe is indebted to the Arabian philosophers, and 
especially to Averroes, for the knowledge of Aristotle's writings.  
Nothing could be more false, he says; Boethius, who lived in the sixth 
century, St. Isidore, who lived in the sixth and part of the seventh, 
were well acquainted with the writings of Aristotle.  Boethius, who had 
spent a number of years in Greece, tells us that he translated and 
commented upon all the works of Aristotle that came into his hands.  
Neither Boethius nor St. Isidore fell into any of the extravagant 
errors which were taught at Paris, and St. Thomas saw that the evil lay 
not in Aristotle but in Aristotle misunderstood and misrepresented, as 
he was in the writings of Averroes and other Arabian philosophers.  He 
resolved, therefore, to purify and Christianize the philosophy of 
Aristotle, in order to make it what it should be, the handmaid of 
Christian theology.  God, Who is the Author of reason as well as of 
revelation, by His grace and in His mercy moved St. Thomas to make this 
resolution when he saw the condition of philosophy in the thirteenth 
century.<p>
