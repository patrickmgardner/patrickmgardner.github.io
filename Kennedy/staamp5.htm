<hr><H1>Influence of St. Thomas on Philosophy</h1>

The brief and imperfect sketch of the condition of philosophy in the 
thirteenth century, which was given in the preceding chapter, will 
suffice to determine what judgment should be passed on those who can 
see nothing but darkness in the Middle Ages.  Notwithstanding the 
imperfections and errors which accompanied the rise of Scholasticism, 
the establishment of the universities and the general revival of 
philosophical and theological studies, it must be admitted by candid 
observers that our own enlightened century cannot boast of greater 
intellectual activity, or of more rapid progress in those branches of 
knowledge which make men truly great in mind.<p>

When we remember that two hundred years before printing was invented 
the medieval universities had reached a state of perfection of which 
Yale and Harvard might well be proud at the beginning of the twentieth 
century, we can form some conception of the patient toil and giant 
energy which characterized the professors and scholars of the 
thirteenth century, and we shall be disposed to judge kindly of their 
imperfections and of the errors into which they fell.<p>

<A NAME="PROVI">PROVIDENCE RULES THE WORLD.</a> -- That those errors 
were serious and of such a nature as to cause alarm is evident from a 
cursory glance at the history of the medieval universities.  The days 
preceding the arrival of St. Thomas at Paris were indeed very dark.  
The atmosphere was filled with gloomy forebodings of schism, heresy, 
infidelity, and of all those dangers to the faith which necessarily 
flow from the destruction of the principles regulating the relations of 
faith and science.  When the professors of a Catholic university openly 
taught Rationalism and Pantheism to say nothing of a host of minor 
errors, men might well have asked:  "If the salt of the earth lose its 
savor, wherewith shall it be salted?"<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n48">[48]</a>  Judging by the rules of merely human 
prudence one would have said that the University of Paris was fast 
drifting into infidelity, and dragging the world with it.<p> 

To suppose, however, that such a state of things was to continue, and 
that no remedy would be found to check the growing evil, would be to 
fall into the error of those who do not count upon Divine Providence in 
reading the history of the past or in prophesying with regard to the 
future.  The one grand lesson to be learned from the reading of history 
in the light of Christianity is this:  That there is a God Whose wisdom 
and power direct the affairs of this world in such a manner as to 
promote the ends which He wishes to attain.  In order to manifest this 
truth to men God from time to time permits the recurrence of those dark 
and gloomy periods when no ray of light can be hoped for unless it be 
sent from above.  Paris in the thirteenth century furnishes a striking 
illustration of such a period, of such a crisis in human affairs; and 
the angelic intellect of St. Thomas was the bright ray of light sent 
forth from the Eternal Sun of truth to remind philosophers of "the true 
light which enlighteneth every man that cometh into the world,"<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n49">[49]</a> pointing out with unerring accuracy 
the paths leading to true science and solid virtue, conducting men to 
the throne of the Almighty, who rules over the world of minds as well 
as over the material world.<p> 

<A NAME="Prede"><b>Predecessors and Contemporaries of St. 
Thomas.</b></a> -- This statement must not be understood as detracting 
in any way from the praise which is due to other great philosophers and 
theologians who illustrated the Church at the time when Scholasticism 
came to be the handmaid of religion.  It would be a sin against justice 
as well as a crime against historical truth to ignore the influence for 
good exerted by such men as St. Anselm, St. Bernard, Alexander of 
Hales, St. Bonaventure, Albertus Magnus, and a host of less renowned 
but very learned and saintly men whose lives were devoted in the 
eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries to the defence and 
development of Christian doctrine.  But, with all due respect for their 
claims to our admiration and gratitude, it is universally admitted 
that, in the midst of the darkness and confusion of the thirteenth 
century, St. Thomas was the one grand, bright star in the firmament, 
shedding light into the darkness, throwing order into the confused mass 
of philosophical and theological opinions which prevented a clear and 
systematic conception of the truths of revelation.<p> 

<A NAME="LEOXI">LEO XIII ON ST. THOMAS.</a> -- "Amongst the 
Scholastic doctors," writes Leo XIII, "Thomas Aquinas stands pre-
eminent, being the Prince and Master of all."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n50">[50]</a>  The Pontiff then quotes the words of 
Cardinal Cajetan, who wrote of St. Thomas:  "Because he had the deepest 
veneration for the sacred Doctors of old, he acquired, in a measure, 
the intelligence of them all." (<i>Doctores sacros, quia summe 
veneratus est, ideo intellectum omnium quodammodo sortitus est</i>.)<p> 

St. Thomas himself, in his Christian humility and solid good sense, was 
the first to recognize the advantages he had derived from those who 
preceded him.  It is edifying as well as instructive to note with what 
reverence and affection he mentions Plato and Arisotle, St. Augustine, 
Boethius, St. Isidore, Peter Lombard, the "Master of Sentences," 
Albertus Magnus, and other authors whose works are quoted in his 
writings.  He would not accept our words of praise if, in exaggerated 
admiration of his mighty work, we failed to recognize and proclaim the 
influence exerted on his mind by those who went before him, especially 
by the authors just mentioned.  St. Thomas does not need any words of 
exaggerated praise.  His true glory comes from this, that having acquired, 
by study and with the assistance of Heaven, a knowledge of the true 
principles of Christian philosophy, he applied them in such a manner 
that posterity, in grateful recognition of his services to the Faith, 
has unanimously saluted him as the Christian Aristotle and the prince 
of theologians.<p>

<A NAME="NEWMA">NEWMAN'S DEFINITION OF A GREAT MIND.</a> -- "A truly 
great intellect," writes Cardinal Newman, "and one recognized to be 
such by the common opinion of mankind, such as the intellect of 
Aristotle or of St. Thomas, of Newton or of Goethe -- is one which 
takes a connected view of old and new, past and present, far and near, 
and which has an insight into the influence of all these one on 
another, without which there is no whole and no centre.  It possesses 
the knowledge, not only of things but also of their mutual and true 
relations; knowledge not merely considered as acquirement, but as 
philosophy."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n51">[51]</a><p> 

Educated in quiet, trained in piety, strong in faith, obedient to 
authority, St. Thomas, with his all-embracing and penetrating mind, 
surveyed the world of the universities.  He saw the old and the new, 
the past and the present; he recognized all that was good whether in 
the old or new; his keen eye quickly detected the errors which were 
countenanced at Paris in the thirteenth century; and he was not slow in 
determining to devote his life to the work of <i>Christianizing 
philosophy</i> and <i>systemizing theology</i>.<p>

<A NAME="RECON">RECONCILIATION OF FAITH AND REASON IN THE THIRTEENTH 
CENTURY.</a> -- The great triumph of the thirteenth century was the 
reconciliation of faith and reason; and for this victory we are 
indebted principally to St. Thomas, of whom Leo XIII writes:  "He 
distinguished reason from faith, but he joined them together in 
friendly union, preserving the rights and recognizing the dignity of 
each; so that reason, reared aloft on the wings of St. Thomas, could 
scarcely soar higher, and it was almost impossible even for faith to be 
supported by additional or stronger aids from reason than had already 
been furnished by the Angelic Doctor."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n52">[52]</a> In these words of Pope Leo we have a 
r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the life-work of St. Thomas.<p> 

<A NAME="CHOIC">CHOICE OF ARISTOTLE AS MODEL.</a> -- The first step 
he took in the accomplishment of his Heaven-given task was to choose 
Aristotle as the model philosopher, whose works he was to use and whose 
principles he was to apply even in what he did for the perfection of 
theological science.  History has proved the wisdom of his choice, 
which was not made without exciting some adverse criticism.  If St. 
Thomas ever spoke to others of his plans we can imagine his brethren 
attempting to dissuade him from what many must have looked upon as the 
dream of an enthusiastic Utopian.  Was not Aristotle responsible for 
the Rationalism and Pantheism which disgraced the University of Paris?  
Had not Robert de Cour&ccedil;on, the papal legate, forbidden the 
reading of Aristotle's Physics and Metaphysics?  These representations 
were made with sincerity and with much force, but St. Thomas was 
unmoved.  From Boethius and St. Isidore and especially from his old 
master, Albertus Magnus, he had learned to know Aristotle and the value 
of his works.  Moreover, granting for the sake of argument that, 
speculatively speaking, it would have been better to have chosen Plato, 
or to cry down philosophical studies which had been abused at Paris, 
and advocate a return to the study of the Fathers and of the 
Scriptures, there was a practical aspect of the question which St. 
Thomas did not overlook.  The movement in favor of Aristotle was so 
strong that it could not be resisted.<p> 

"The university professors of the thirteenth century," writes Mother 
Drane, "regarded Aristotle much as the masters of Carthage had done, of 
whom St. Augustine says that they spoke of the Categories of that 
philosopher with their cheek bursting with pride, as of something 
altogether divine."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n53">[53]</a>  Hence it would 
have been impossible to dissuade them from reading the works of the 
Stagyrite.  Had that attempt been made, they would have complained that 
the Church was opposed to the spread of learning and of philosophical 
enquiry.  Notwithstanding all that was done of Albertus Magnus, St. 
Thomas, and other Scholastic doctors, that calumny has been spread and 
repeated, and our own ears may have heard utterances founded on a 
lurking suspicion that the Church <i>is</i> opposed to the universal 
diffusion of knowledge and scientific investigation.  There would have 
been a specious pr../resource for the charge had the great Scholastic doctors 
risen up in arms against Aristotle.  It must now be branded as an 
infamous calmny by every intelligent man who has even an imperfect 
knowledge of the career of St. Thomas, and of the honors which learned 
men of all classes, during the last six centuries, have united in 
heaping upon the great Christian Commentator of Aristotle.  Wisely, 
then, did St. Thomas resolve to use his influence and devote his 
energies, not to the suppression of Aristotle, but to the purification 
of his works.<p> 

<A NAME="Texto"><b>Text of Aristotle Corrected and Purified.</b></a> -- 
His first care was to obtain an accurate copy of the works of 
Aristotle.  William of Moerbeke, O.P., who was afterwards appointed 
archbishop of Corinth (in 1277), translated Aristotle's works directly 
from the Greek for the use and at the request of St. Thomas, "who 
himself understood the language well enough to criticise his friend's 
version."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n54">[54]</a>  He next set himself to 
the task of purifying the text of the pagan philosopher from all errors 
that were opposed to the truths of Christianity.  This he did in his 
Commentaries on Aristotle, which alone would have sufficed to render 
his name immortal.  They fill five volumes (small quarto) in the Parma 
edition of his works.<p> 

<A NAME="Averr"><b>Averroes Annihilated.</b></a> -- St. Thomas never 
lost sight of that arch-enemy of Christianity, Averroes, whose writings 
had contributed more than any other cause to the perversion of the 
principles of philosophy at Paris.  One feels like saying that this 
"perverter of Peripatetic philosophy," as St. Thomas calls him, had the 
genius of a fallen angel, so insidious are the errors which he 
cunningly wove into his explanantions of Aristotle's theories.  Abelard 
had been captivated by the vigor and originality of his writings, and 
became, in consequence, the parent of Rationalism.  Amaury de Bene fell 
into Pantheism because he was blinded by the insidious and specious 
Averroistic theory which asserted that all men had but one intellect.  
In fact, most men of ordinary capacity either would have been carried 
away by the current of universal enthusiasm and admiration for the 
Commentator, or would have shrunk with horror from the study of a 
philosophy which caused the professors of a Catholic university to 
forget the principles of their faith and to ignore the warning words of 
the authority appointed by Jesus Christ to point out the ways of truth.  
St. Thomas, in the calmness of his transcendant and penetrating genius, 
took a more elevated and practical view of the situation.  Averroes, 
not Aristotle, was the cause of all the confusion; hence Aristotle was 
to be retained, Averroes was to be confounded, refuted, and rejected by 
all means known to champions of the true faith.<p> 

Hence it is that the errors of Averroes are mentioned and refuted on 
almost every page of St. Thomas' writings, and after the example of his 
master, Albertus Magnus, he wrote one book, "De Unitate Intellectus," 
which is devoted entirely to a refutation of the fundamental theory of 
Averroes, viz., that all men had but one intellect.  Because universal 
ideas are alike in all minds, therefore, concluded Averroes, they are 
the product of one intellect; hence there is but one intellect in all 
men.  Amaury de Bene, considering that this intellect is the noblest 
part of man, and that which makes him like unto God; considering also 
that all things are one in the mind of God, concluded that the 
intellect of God and the intellect of man were identical.  This was 
downright Pantheism, yet these strange theories were openly taught by 
professors of the University of Paris.  St. Thomas refuted these 
pernicious theories by establishing a true conception of the nature and 
powers of man's intellect and of his knowledge of universal ideas.<p> 

<A NAME="Souli"><b>Soul is the Form of the Human Body.</b></a> -- 
Rejecting Plato's dualistic theory which made the soul and body of man 
two distinct beings joined together without substantial unity, he 
adopted, explained, and defended the teaching of Aristotle, that the 
soul is the substantial form of the human body, distinct from it, but 
united so intimately with it that the two form one substantial being, 
which is an individual of the human species.<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n55">[55]</a>  The soul alone is not the man; the 
body is not the man; but the soul and body united constitute an 
individual man, a person, e.g., John, or Peter, or Paul.  This doctrine 
was afterwards solemnly defined as a dogma of the Catholic faith at the 
Council of Vienne (1311-1312), and its proclamation by St. Thomas was a 
death-blow to Averroism.  If the soul belongs to a particular 
individual, then there is no place for the Averroistic dream of one 
intellect for all men.  Moreover, there is no foundation for such a 
oneness of intellect as Averroes imagined.  Universal ideas are alike 
in all men, but they are not numerically identical.  By my intellect I 
form the same kind of idea that you form in your mind.  The matter of 
these ideas is furnished by the senses, which perceive the objects of 
the external world, but from the same material furnished by the senses 
I form my idea and you form your idea, as each one knows from 
pyschologoical experience.  Likeness of the ideas formed is no proof of 
the identity of the intellects forming them; just as a strong 
resemblance between two beautiful faces does not prove -- and no one 
thinks it does prove -- that the two beauties are one person.<p> 

<A NAME="Panth"><b>Pantheism Refuted.</b></a> -- This doctrine of 
Aristotle and St. Thomas removes the foundation on which was built the 
Pantheism of Amaury de Bene.  If ideas which are alike can be formed by 
intellects which are distinct, this is no reason for supposing that 
God's intellect -- the Mind in Which all things are one -- is identical 
with the intellect of individuals.  The wild error of Amaury is nothing 
but the exaggeration and perversion of a great truth.  Contemplating 
his intellect every man should exclaim with the Psalmist:  "The light 
of Thy countenance, O Lord, is signed upon us," but he is not justified 
in saying, as did the Pantheists of old and the Ontologists in our 
days, that the light is God Himself.<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n56">[56]</a><p> 

Our minds are participations and effects of the one great, supreme 
Intellignece; they are rays emanating from the great Sun of justice and 
truth; but effects are distinct from the causes which produce them, and 
rays are distinct from the light which sends them forth.  The intellect 
of each man is a substantial unity, with its own powers and its own 
operations, and the very imperfection of those powers and of those 
operations should have been sufficient to convince men that they were 
distinct from the Divinity, being mere shadows, when compared with the 
great light by which the minds of all men are enlighted.<p> 

<A NAME="RATIO">RATIONALISM REJECTED</a> -- TRUE RELATIONS OF FAITH 
AND REASON. -- The next great service which St. Thomas rendered to 
Philosophy was to determine the true relations between faith and 
reason.  Leo XIII writes in his Encyclical "AEterni Patris":  "One 
would almost say that St. Thomas was present at all the Councils of the 
Church held since his time and that he presided over the deliberations 
of the assembled Fathers."  In the last General Council, held at the 
Vatican under Pope Pius IX, decrees were promulgated against the 
Rationalism of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  Whoever takes 
the pains to read the chapter of the Council on Faith and Reason will 
see that the principles therein proposed and defined are almost 
verbatim the same as the principles which St. Thomas proposed and 
elucidated in order to confound the Rationalists of his days.  St. 
Thomas was not a Don Quixote, fighting against spectres and windmills; 
he was a living, practical philosopher, and he used the poewrful 
intellect which God gave him to destroy theories and errors which were 
actually in vogue when he wrote.  Whether the Rationalism of the 
thirteenth century should be ascribed principally to the infidelity of 
Averroes, who had no faith, or to the pride of Abelard, who was full of 
conceit and self-sufficiency, or to the exaggerated enthusiasm for 
philosophical studies, which blinded men in so far that "fools rushed 
in where angels feared to tread," certain it is that Rationalism was 
one of the living errors which St. Thomas was called to destroy.  
Philosophers attempted to prove and explain everything, even the 
sublimest mysteries of faith.  Disciples of Averroes taught that the 
doctrines of faith and the conclusion of reason might be contradictory; 
but that made little difference, because then the mind simply came to 
no conclusion; in other words, it believed nothing at all, and truth 
became a mere matter of words.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n57">[57]</a><p> 

St. Thomas' whole person and life and all his writings are a 
contradiction and refutation of this doctrine.  He was a living proof 
of the truth that faith and science should not be enemies, but should 
live in harmony, and that strong faith does not preclude the fullest 
exercise and development of man's highest faculty, reason.  He was a 
firm believer in all the truths of Christianity, yet no scientist of 
any age used his reason more than St. Thomas did; but he was careful to 
determine with the pen of a master the province of faith and the limits 
beyond which reason must not venture.  St. Thomas determined so 
accurately and so luminously the true relations of faith and reason 
that, since his time, nothing more has been required to refute any 
error that may have arisen on this subject than to call attention to 
his principles; and the principal motive which impelled Leo XIII to 
write his Encyclical on the restoration of Scholastic philosophy was 
the desire to see reason united with faith and serving it in our time 
as it did in the days of St. Thomas.<p> 

The following is a summary of his principles determining the true 
relations of faith and reason.  They are found chiefly in "Cont. 
Gent.," Book I -- "Exposit. in lib. Boethii de Trinit.," Quest. II, 
art. 3., and in the "Summa Theol.," passim, especially in Quest. I.<p> 

<A NAME="Disti"><b>Distinction Between Natural and Supernatural.</b></a> 
-- (1) There are two distinct classes of truth, the natural and 
supernatural.  Natural truths are those which can be known by the 
reason of man unaided by revelation.  Man, by the power of his 
intellect, without any especial assistance from God, can know many 
things about himself, about the material world, and about God; or, as 
St. Thomas says, about things that are beneath him, things that are in 
him, and things that are above him.<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n58">[58]</a><p> 

Supernatural truths are those mysteries,<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n59">[59]</a> hidden from ages and generations in 
God, which man never could or would have known, had they not been 
revealed by the Spirit of God, which "searcheth all things, even the 
deep things of God."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n60">[60]</a>  The elevation 
of man to the supernatural order, the Trinity of Persons in one God, 
the Incarnation, the Real Presence of Our Lord in the Eucharist, the 
efficacy of Baptism and of the other sacraments -- to give a few 
examples -- are truths which man can know only because God has deigned 
to make them known by revelation.  Hence it is wrong to suppose with 
Abelard and other Rationalists that all things are to be measured by 
the mind of man.  Our intellect is finite, but it tells us with 
certainty that God is infinite, hence we could prove <i>a priori</i> a 
truth which we know from experience, that there are more things in 
heaven and on earth than are dreamed of in our philosophy.<p> 

<A NAME="NoOpp"><b>No Opposition Between Faith and Reason.</b></a> -- 
(2) Although the truths of faith are distinct from natural truths, and 
faith is above reason, there can never be any real contradiction 
between faith and science.  God is the Author of reason as well as of 
revelation; God cannot contradict Himself or teach error; hence, as St. 
Thomas wrote,<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n61">[61]</a> revelation does not 
destroy the light of reason, but rather completes and perfects it, as 
grace perfects nature and the faculties of the soul.<p> 

How can any intelligent man for an instant suppose that there could be 
real opposition between faith and reason, both of which come from God?  
There may be an apparent contradiction, but this only proves that what 
we suppose to be a certain teaching of science was not science, or that 
we had a false conception of God's revelation.  Admit God, and it must 
be admitted that He cannot contradict Himself.<p> 

<A NAME="Faith"><b>Faith and Reason United in Harmony.</b></a> -- (3) 
Faith and reason should go hand in hand, not indeed as equals, because 
one is the light of God and the other is the light given to a creature 
by God, but as a mistress and her servant live together in peace and 
harmony.<p> 

<A NAME="Fait2"><b>Faith Protects Reason from Error.</b></a> -- (1) 
Faith, or revelation, protects reason and prevents it from falling into 
error. We know from history that the greatest among the pagan 
philosophers fell into many errors even concerning truths that could 
have been known by reason.  Cicero denied God's fore-knowledge.  Plato 
admitted the eternity of matter, and in his ethico-political system 
defended communism, the suppression of individual rights and the 
supremacy of the state.  Aristotle, who was perhaps the greatest of all 
the philosophers of antiquity, improved upon the political system of 
Plato, but retained some of his errors.  Moreover, he denied the 
universality of God's providence, and to this day it is an open 
question whether he denied the eternity of matter and whether he 
affirmed the immortality of the human soul.  Without revelation, says 
St. Thomas, sublime, natural truths would be known only by a few, and 
after long investigation, and even then doubt and error would be 
intermingled with their knowledge.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n62">[62]</a>  
See what wild theories are proposed to-day by those who do not follow 
the guidance of faith!<p> 

<A NAME="Widen"><b>Widens the Field of Investigation.</b></a> -- (2) 
Moreover, faith opens up new fields of investigation.  Outsiders think 
that believing Christians are very much restricted in the use of their 
reason.  Why do they not pause to think more seriously?  We have as 
wide a field for investigation as they have, plus the very wide and 
fertile field furnished by the revelation of truths which to them are 
unknown.  The difference consists in this:  they investigate as groping 
around in the dark, we investigate under the direction of a Guide Who 
can neither deceive nor be deceived.  If they will take the pains to 
read a good work on Catholic philosophy and theology, they will soon 
see how much has been added to the science of philosophy by the efforts 
of those who investigated and penetrated, as far as it is possible for 
the human mind to penetrate, into the depths of the mysteries which 
were revealed by God to man.<p> 

<A NAME="WHATR">WHAT REASON SHOULD DO FOR FAITH.</a> -- This brings 
us to the point where St. Thomas (especially "Exposit. in Boethium De 
Trin."), definitely and accurately points out the service which reason 
should render to faith.  In sacred doctrine, says St. Thomas, we can 
use philosophy in three ways:  (1) to prepare for faith, (2) to explain 
the truths of faith, (3) to defend the truths of faith.  Revelation in 
itself does not need the service of reason; because revelation, 
objectively taken, is God's own knowledge, which is perfect in itself 
and in no manner depends on the mind of man.  But this revelation, if 
it is to guide man, must be received by him, and understood by him; the 
work of preparing man to receive the faith and to understand what he 
believes is the work of reason.<p> 

<A NAME="Reaso"><b>Reason Proves the Preambles of Faith.</b></a> -- In 
the first place, there are certain truths which faith presupposes -- 
<i>preambula fidei</i> -- preambles to faith -- St. Thomas calls them.  
Before we can believe what God has revealed we must first know that we 
have a soul capable of grasping metaphysical truth; that there is a God 
Who knows all things and is incapable of deceiving us, and that we have 
good reasons for believing that God has spoken to men, revealing truths 
which otherwise would not have been known.  Moreover, we should not be 
prepared to believe what is revealed with regard to the supernatural 
and ineffable joys of Heaven if we did not first hold that our souls 
are immortal.  To prove these truths and thus prepare men for faith is 
the first service of reason to revelation.<p> 

<A NAME="Reas2"><b>Reason Explains and Develops the Doctrine 
Revealed.</b></a> -- In the next place, reason may be used to explain, 
to put in order and to develop the revealed doctrines.  St. Augustine, 
for instance, in his books on the Trinity, makes use of many 
similitudes taken from philosophy in order to give some faint 
conception of the unity of God's nature in three Divine Persons.  
Moreover, the truths accepted on faith must be put in order, lest there 
be confusion in the mind of the believer.  Some people cannot tell just 
what they do believe, and it is easy to find men who stumble over the 
Immaculate Conception or papal infallibility after accepting, without 
the least hesitation, the greatest of all revealed mysteries, the 
Trinity.  They would not be so illogical if they made better use of 
their reason.  Then, again, the truths revealed are like seeds or germs 
containing in themselves many other truths which may be evolved or 
developed from the principles of faith.  For instance, when it has been 
declared that Jesus Christ was God and man, this truth, scientifically 
explained and developed, furnishes us with a number of truths with 
regard to the Body, the Mind and the Will of Christ, and with regard to 
the nature of the union between the divinity and humanity.  But these 
truths will remain hidden unless reason deduces them as theological 
conclusions from the principles of faith.<p> 

<A NAME="Reas3"><b>Reason Defends Faith.</b></a> -- The third service 
of reason to revelation consists in defending the faith.  The dogmas of 
the Christian religion are not accepted by all mankind.  Some attempt 
to undermine the foundations of our faith, and some, without paying any 
attention to the foundations, attack the sacred edifice in spots which 
to them appear weak.  Against such attacks we cannot use any weapons 
except those furnished by reason, because our opponents do not admit 
the principles of faith.  Reason, says St. Thomas, can defend the faith 
in two ways:  First, positively, by showing that the objections brought 
forward are founded in falsehood; second, negatively, by showing that, 
whatever truth may be in them, they at least do not prove the falsity 
of the Christian dogma against which they are urged.<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n63">[63]</a><p> 

To sum up: reason prepares the mind for faith; reason explains the 
truths of faith; reason defends the truths of faith.  These principles 
are frequently laid down by St. Thomas, and they were applied in all 
his works, especially in the "Summa contra Gentiles" and in the "Summa 
Theologica."  There is no exaggeration in saying that these principles 
form an undercurrent which runs through all his works, coming to the 
surface from time to time, as if to remind his readers that they 
furnish the key to St. Thomas' plans for reforming and perfecting 
philosophy.<p> 

<A NAME="StTho"><b>St. Thomas Proves the Preambles.</b></a> -- (1) St. 
Thomas surpasses all ecclesiastical writers in his masterful treatises 
on those truths which are necessary as a preparation for faith.  The 
chapters which he wrote on the reality of intellectual knowledge, on 
the existence and veracity of God, on the spirituality and immortality 
of the human soul, and on the reasonableness of Christian faith, 
supported as it is by God's own arguments, miracles and prophecies, 
stand to-day and will continue to stand as monuments to his genius.<p> 

<A NAME="StTh2"><b>St. Thomas Explains and Develops Faith.</b></a> -- 
(2) His explanations and developments of the dogmas of faith, in the 
"Summa against the Gentiles" and in the "Summa Theologica," affords a 
justification for all the encomiums that have been heaped upon him by 
popes, councils, universities and religious orders, and have caused his 
"Summa Theologica" to be considered the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of human 
reason explaining the truths of revelation -- a masterpiece of human 
genius, the greatest masterpiece that the world has ever known.<p> 

<A NAME="StTh3"><b>St. Thomas Defends Faith.</b></a> -- (3) In 
defending the truths of faith and in answering objections St. Thomas is 
truly wonderful.  Those who are acquainted with his works are not 
surprised at the words of Leo XIII:  "He alone confuted all the errors 
of past times, and at the same time supplied invincible weapons for 
overcoming those which were constantly to arise in the future."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n64">[64]</a><p> 

St. Thomas saw all sides of a question and it is a well-known fact that 
it is almost impossible to find an argument brought forward by modern 
heresy or unbelief which was not proposed and answered by St. Thomas.  
In the "Summa Theologica" alone ten thousand objections are proposed 
and answered.  Thus did St. Thomas press reason into the service of 
faith.<p> 

This compendious and imperfect description of his labors for the 
reformation of Christian philosophy will suffice to show that he was in 
reality the Heaven-sent genius who introduced order into the confused 
efforts and systems Christian philosophers in the thirteenth century.  
Much might be said concerning the army of learned teachers, preachers, 
and writers whose talents have been devoted to the service of God, and 
who gloried in being called disciples of St. Thomas, whom the 
University of Paris calls the <i>fons doctorum</i> -- the source, 
or fountain, from which doctors spring.  The history of these 
disciples, from the close of the thirteenth century down to our own 
days, would be very interesting and instructive, but such a study would 
extend far beyond the scope of a short sketch.  Whoever knows, though 
it be only in outline, the writings of the Angelic Doctor, will see 
clearly that his was the master-mind which, after Christianizing the 
philosophy of the thirteenth century, became, and will continue to be, 
the type of perfection for all Christian philosophers.<p>
