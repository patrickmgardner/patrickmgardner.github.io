<hr><H1>The Rise of Scholasticism -- St. Anselm  (1034-1109)</h1>

Much attention has been given, especially in recent times, to questions 
relating to evolution. This is a very broad subject, including in its 
various aspects many theories and discussions concerning the origin and 
development of all forms of created being and life.  Naturally 
inquisitive and studious, man attempts to explain the nature of all 
things that come under his observation, and becomes deeply interested 
in the study of their origin and development, whether the subject of 
his investigation be the oak springing from the acorn, the visible 
world created by Almighty God, or the human soul, created also by God, 
and gradually developing its faculties until man reaches the highest 
perfection attainable world.<p> 

Some persons think that the most important study in evolution is 
offered by the visible world in which we live. The story of the 
Creation comes to us in an inspired book, commanding all the attention 
and respect due to any book of which God is the author. But, were it 
possible to abstract from the fact that faith and revelation are 
necessarily involved when we consider the origin and evolution of the 
universe, it is certain that more attention should be given to the 
history of the mind than to the history of the material beings of our 
visible world.<p>

In the history of minds there is no chapter more interesting or more 
instructive than that which deals with the progress of men in the 
knowledge of philosophy during the Middle Ages, from the beginning of 
the ninth to the end of the thirteenth century. Those centuries are so 
little known, and have been so grossly misrepresented, that many men, 
even amongst those who consider themselves educated and fair-minded, 
are not prepared to hear that the Middle Ages can be considered as 
model or ideal in any respect whatsoever. Nevertheless, it can be 
boldly asserted and proved that the centuries, which too often have 
been called "dark," were the ages in which men reached the summit of 
mental progress and intellectual perfection. In the experimental 
sciences, and in all that pertains to material progress, the twentieth 
century surpasses the thirteenth, which may be called the banner 
century of the Middle Ages; but when this concession has been made, we 
may ask: In what else can our times claim superiority? In faith and 
spirituality, in literature and architecture, in philosophy and 
theology, our days will suffer very much in the comparison. And it must 
be borne in mind that the branches in which the Middle Ages excelled 
are the very branches which constitute, or presuppose, the cultivation 
and development of all that is highest and noblest in man's nature.<p>

Have men been so blinded by prejudice that they lose sight of the 
superiority of mind over matter? It is scarcely credible that 
intelligent men are willing to assert that the remarkable engineering 
feats, the elegant trains lighted by electricity, the automobiles and 
airships of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries are sufficient 
indications of progress and perfection to settle the question of 
superiority. The men of the thirteenth century deserve more credit for 
one beautiful Gothic cathedral than we are entitled to claim for all 
our automobiles and airships, and when we consider the development of 
man's mind and his progress in the art of knowing, any candid observer 
must admit that we have much to learn from the much-abused Middle Ages. 
The experimental sciences will be more fully considered in a subsequent 
chapter (<A HREF="staamp3.htm">Ch. III</a>).<p>

<A NAME="SCHOL">SCHOLASTICISM.</a> -- The study of Scholastic 
philosophy and the use of philosophical knowledge in explaining and 
defending the truths of faith are distinguishing features of the Middle 
Ages. So well did the philosophers and theologians of those times 
understand the true relations of faith and reason that their principles 
were solemnly adopted and proclaimed in our own times, viz., the 
Vatican Council.  Rome was not built in a day; the philosophical 
systems of the schoolmen were not built in a day. There were years of 
investigation, doubt and dispute before their systems were formulated. 
We can trace the rise and progress and the perfection of Scholasticism. 
We begin the study of the subject by considering all that is brought to 
mind by the name of St. Anselm, who is usually styled the "Father of 
Scholasticism" in the Western Church.<p> 

<A NAME="WhatS"><b>What Scholasticism is not.</b></a> -- Scholasticism 
has been misunderstood and misrepresented more than any other feature 
of life in the Middle Ages. To this very day there are many for whom 
the word is synonymous with subtlety and logic-chopping. That there 
have been abuses of Scholasticism, and that these abuses furnished 
pr../resources for rejecting the system, is freely admitted. The existence 
and causes of those abuses will be considered in subsequent chapter. 
Nevertheless, here, as elsewhere, we should apply the principle that 
what is good should not be condemned or rejected because it has been 
abused.<p> 

He is a poor student of history and philosophy who thinks that subtlety 
is the quintessence, or even a necessary element or property, of 
Scholastic philosophy.  Many of its terms are not readily understood by 
the ordinary student and they cannot lay claim to elegance in latinity. 
But, is it not true that medicine, jurisprudence, chemistry, botany, 
biology, and other sciences employ technical terms that are not 
understood by the uninitiated? We do not on that account reject those 
sciences. Why should we apply a different rule to Scholastic 
philosophy, especially since we are not prepared to offer a suitable 
substitute for the teaching and terminology of the Schoolmen? Correct 
the abuses; suppress idle discussions; banish confusing subtleties; but 
retain what is good in Scholasticism, for it is of great value. 
Scholasticism, in the first place, represents the highest form of 
intellectual activity and intellectual perfection; in the second place, 
for those who are Christians, it is of the utmost importance in 
explaining and defending the mysteries of faith.<p>

<A NAME="Whati"><b>What is Philosophy?</b></a> -- Philosophy is the 
love, desire, and pursuit of wisdom.  Taken in its broadest sence it 
includes the knowledge of all things in as far as they can be known by 
the light of reason: "<i>Rerum divinarum et humanarum causarumque 
quibus hae res continentur scientia</i>";<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n1">[1]</a> the knowledge of human and divine things 
and of the causes by which they are related to each other. Philosophy, 
in a restricted sense, is "the knowledge of things in their highest and 
most universal causes, so far as such knowledge is attainable by the 
natural light of reason."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n2">[2]</a>  Ordinary 
scientific knowledge is satisfied when it assigns the immediate or 
proximate causes of things that come under our observation; wisdom, or 
philosophy, refers those same things to their still higher and more 
universal causes; that is, it seeks to understand and explain them in 
their essence, as it is absolutely and must be.  Philosophy seeks to 
explain the intrinsic nature of things and their relation to more 
universal truths."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n3">[3]</a> It is, to  make use 
of a common expression, the knowledge which consists in "going to the 
bottom of things," penetrating into the deepest recesses of their 
being, and assigning the very last and highest, and deepest reasons for 
all that is asserted concerning the object of the investigation.<p> 

Philosophy as a special science, and, as it is taught nowadays, is 
taken in a much more restricted sense. It is not the knowledge of all 
things, but the <i>knowledge of certain higher things</i>, higher truths, 
<i>in as far as they can be known by the light of natural reason.</i><p>

This special science has six parts: <b>Logic</b>, which treats of the 
laws of right reasoning;  <b>Ontology</b>, or <b>Metaphysics</b>, which 
has for its object the  essential predicates of all things, and deals 
with  truths which are strictly and absolutely universal; 
<b>Cosmology</b>, which treats of the visible world;  
<b>Anthropology</b>, which treats of man, especially of the soul.  
<b>Natural Theology</b>, which treats of God; <b>Ethics</b>, or 
<b>Moral Theology</b>, which treats of moral good and the rules of 
conduct.<p>

<b>Physics</b>, which for many centuries was considered a part of 
general philosophy, is now a special treatise on matter and material 
bodies and their phenomena.<p>

<A NAME="Perio"><b>Periods in History of Philosophy.</b></a> -- In the 
history of philosophy various stages or periods are distinguished. (A) 
The period of <b>ancient philosophy</b>, the philosophy of the Jews, 
the Greeks, and the Romans down to the time of Christ. (B) Then came 
the philosophy of the <b>Fathers of the Church</b>, which was gradually 
developed into (C) the <b>Scholastic</b> system. (D) The decline of 
Scholasticism, and the philosophy of the <b>Renaissance</b>. Finally 
(E), we have <b>modern philosophy</b>, i.e., the philosophy of the  
seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries.<p> 

(A) -- The first period -- the time before Christ -- was a period of 
effort and struggle. Great and noble were the efforts of pagan 
philosophers to arrive at the knowledge of the truth; great were 
Cicero and Seneca, great were Plato and Aristotle; but reason without 
revelation, in the state of fallen nature, never had and cannot have a 
perfect knowledge of truths even of the natural order. In his 
Encyclical "AEterni Patris," on the restoration of philosophical 
studies, Leo XIII says: "Even those who were considered the wisest of 
ancient philosophers, but who had not the gift of faith, erred most 
grievously in many things. They often taught, along with many truths, 
things false and absurd, and very many that were doubtful and uncertain 
respecting the nature of God, the first origin of things, the 
government of the world, the divine knowledge of futurity, the cause 
and origin of evil, man's last end and eternal happiness; respecting 
virtues and vices, and many other subjects a true and certain knowledge 
of which is of the utmost importance to the human race.<p>

(B) -- With the introduction and spread of Christianity came 
<b>Christian Philosophy</b>, which is represented in the first ages of 
the Church by the Apologists and the Fathers. Christian Philosophy is 
nothing more than reason used in the service of faith and revelation. 
The Fathers, guided by St. Paul,<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n4">[4]</a> 
cautioned the followers of Christ against philosophy and vain deceit 
according to the traditions of men, but they did not condemn sound 
philosophy and the right use of reason, "by which," St. Augustine says, 
"wholesome faith is begotten, nourished, defended, and strengthened."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n5">[5]</a><p> 

In the first eight centuries of the Christian era we have the names of 
such philosophical writers as Dionysius the Areopagite, first century; 
St. Justin, Athenagoras, St. Irenaeus, second century; Tertullian, 
clement of Alexandria, Origen, third century; St. Augustine, fourth 
century; Boethius, Isidore of Seville, Cassiodorus, sixth century; 
Venerable Bede and St. John Damascene, eighth century. This brings us 
down to the period of Scholastic philosophy. St. John Damascene is 
called the "Father of Scholasticism" in the Eastern church, as St. 
Anselm is in the Western Church, because they were the first notable, 
orthodox writers who applied the principles of Aristotle's <i>Logic</i> 
and <i>Metaphysics</i> to the study of Theology.<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n6">[6]</a><p> 

(C) -- Etymologically and historically Scholastic Philosophy is simply 
the philosophy which was taught in the schools, in the time of 
Charlemagne, and afterwards, whether they were the schools properly so 
called, opened at the courts, at the episcopal sees, and in the 
monasteries, or the episcopal seminaries and the universities. All 
knowledge acquired in those days was called scholastic, and Scholastic 
philosophy was simply that method of philosophizing and of teaching 
philosophy which was adopted in the schools because it was well adapted 
to their needs.<p>

Charlemagne was a great patron of learning, and it is to the schools 
and masters of his time that we trace the beginnings of Scholasticism. 
Venerable Bede and St. John Damascene, who lived in the eighth century, 
may be regarded as the last representatives of Patristic philosophy, 
and St. John is the connecting link between the Fathers and the 
Scholastics.<p>

Great things in this world usually have modest beginnings, and 
Scholasticism, which has exercised such a remarkable influence on the 
theology and history of the church, is not an exception to the rule. 
The ninth century marks the beginning of Scholasticism; and the first 
Scholastics were men who did not devote themselves exclusively, or 
principally, to the study of philosophy. Alcuin, Rabanus Maurus, Scotus 
Erigena, and Remigius of Auxerre were rather the great schoolmasters of 
their times; and a schoolmaster in those days was supposed to he 
skilled in all branches of learning, literature, history, and the 
Sacred Scriptures being the favorite studies.<p>

In the schools the pupils were instructed in the seven liberal arts, 
under the name of the Trivium, embracing grammar, logic, and rhetoric, 
and the Quadrivium, which included arithmetic, geometry, music, and 
astronomy.<p>

Remigius of Auxerre was the first to teach logic in the schools of 
Paris. Alcuin, and his disciple, Rabanus Maurus, who were the greatest 
scholars of their age, wrote treatises on philosophy and commentaries 
on some of the works of Aristotle. Then began that extraordinary zeal 
for learning and eagerness for the study of philosophy and theology 
which was continued in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries, 
culminating in the glories of the university of Paris and the great 
Scholastic doctors of the thirteenth century, Alexander of Hales, St. 
Bonaventure, Albertus Magnus, and St. Thomas of Aquin. Whoever reads 
the history of those times will find it impossible to understand how 
anything but ignorance and prejudice could account for the assertion 
that the Church is the enemy of science and learning.<p>

All parts of the picture are not equally bright and attractive. There 
was the barrenness of the tenth century, called by Baronius "the iron 
age." There were the strange theories and errors of Gotteschalk, Scotus 
Erigena, and Abelard, and the almost endless disputes on the 
Universals. All this is freely admitted, but in this very excitement, 
in these errors, and in the struggles for sound doctrine, we find 
proofs of that intellectual activity which characterizes the ninth, 
eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth centuries, and which finally gave to 
the world those intellectual giants of the thirteenth century, whose 
greatness has never been called in question, and who remain to this day 
unsurpassed in the extent, accuracy, and solidity of their learning.<p>

The human mind was developing its latent energies; men applied 
themselves with avidity to the solution of all problems that could be 
proposed; reason was exercised, cultivated and puffed up; sound 
philosophy was needed to determine the limits of reason, and to point 
out the true relations of faith and reason.<p>

In the very beginning of the Scholastic movement philosophy was called 
upon to serve as the handmaid of religion. Alcuin in the Council of 
Aix-la-Chapelle (799), used his knowledge philosophy to refute the 
error of the Adoptionists, who, by stating that Christ was the adopted 
son of God, revived the error of the Nestorians. Adoption, he argued, 
is predicated of a person; if Christ is the adopted son of God, then 
there is in Christ a human personality as well as the divine 
personality; and this is the heresy of Nestorius.<p>

Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims, was not so happy in choosing Scotus 
Erigena to oppose the teachings of Gotteschalk, the ex monk of Fulda, 
who had broached opinions on the subject of predestination which were 
afterwards openly professed by the Jansenists and the Calvinists; for 
Erigena proved to be a poor champion of the faith. In his work on 
Predestination he favored the errors which he had been asked to refute, 
and sowed the seeds of Rationalism by asserting the supremacy of reason 
over authority in matters of faith. In his philosophical treatise, "De 
Natura Rerum," he fell into Pantheism, representing the Creator and the 
creature as essentially one and the same. Thus in the very beginning we 
find that mixture of good and evil, that use and abuse of philosophy 
and reason, that conflict of faith and human pride, which darkened many 
pages of the Church's history, and furnished a pr../resource for many harsh 
things that have been said and written against the Scholastics. Men 
sometimes seem to forget that all good things can be abused. It is not 
surprising that, in the first burst of enthusiasm and success, 
philosophers should have been carried away on the wings of pride, and 
should have attempted to attain by reason to the knowledge of secrets 
which God alone can reveal.<p>

Before condemning Erigena and Abelard, of whom more will be said 
hereafter, before passing too severe a judgment on those who made 
mistakes nine hundred years ago, when the scientific study of 
philosophy was in its infancy, it would be well to cast a glance over 
the history of more recent times, and to remember how many erroneous 
opinions concerning the true relations of faith and reason have been 
proposed, professed, and condemned in later days, e.g., in the latter 
half of the last century. Some of the early Scholastics erred, but 
their errors were at once detected and condemned; sound reason and 
orthodoxy always found champions to defend their claims.<p>

<A NAME="SAINT">SAINT ANSELM.</a> -- The great champion of sound 
philosophy and of orthodoxy in those days was the pious and learned St. 
Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury. Born in the year 1034, at Aosta, in 
Piedmont, he came to France, studied for three years in Burgundy, and 
in 1059, when he was twenty-five years of age, entered the famous 
school of Bec, in Normandy, which was the most celebrated school of the 
eleventh century. Three years later he became prior, and in 1078 was 
made abbot of the monastery, succeeding his countryman, Lanfranc of 
Pavia, who had been made archbishop of Canterbury. Lanfranc died in 
1089, and four years later Anselm was appointed to the see of 
Canterbury, where he died in 1109.<p> 

Anselm represents all that is best in the first period of 
Scholasticism. The extent of his learning has never been called in 
question; his judgment was enlightened and sound; and, at a time when 
even the learned might have been confused by the multiplication of 
strange theories occasioned by the efforts of scholars to cultivate all 
branches of learning, he was the champion of truth and orthodoxy. Loyal 
to the faith, he made due allowance for the claims of reason, and held 
that it was a "sacred duty to reduce the truths of faith to scientific 
form, the neglect of which would expose Christians to the opprobrium of 
heing inferior to the pagans." This is the underlying principle of his 
"Prosologium," which has been called <i>Fides quaerens intellectum</i>, 
or, the truths of faith scientifically explained and developed.<p>

<A NAME="Argum"><b>Arguments to Prove the Existence of God.</b></a> -- 
It was in this work that he proposed his celebrated argument to prove 
the existence of God. This argument was afterwards proposed, though in 
a modified form, by Descartes, in the seventeenth century, and it is 
still a subject of controversy among writers on philosophy. The famous 
argument is as follows: Every man has an idea of God; even atheists, 
who deny the existence of God, must admit that they have mental 
conceptions of such a Being. Now, what is the idea of God? It is the 
idea of a being greater than which nothing can be conceived. But such a 
being necessarily exists outside of the mind; because, if it exists 
only in the mind, we could think of something greater, namely, of this 
same being as existing outside of the mind. Therefore, that Being 
greater than which nothing can be conceived necessarily exists.<p> 

This argument was at once assailed by Gaunilo, a monk of Marmoutiers, on 
the ground that it was not lawful to conclude from a mental conception 
to an objective reality. St. Thomas Aquinas,<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n7">[7]</a> without mentioning St. Anselm's name, 
rejects his argument, because in it there is a transition from the ideal 
to the real, from the subjective to the objective. What is conceived may 
exist, but the fact that we conceive it does not prove that it does 
exist.  In other words, the conclusion of the argument should be: 
Therefore, when we think of the Infinite we must think of It as 
existing.  From this, however, it does not follow that the Infinite does 
exist, unless you begin with the supposition that there exists outside 
the mind something greater than which nothing can be conceived; and, if 
you do this, you are guilty of a <i>petitio principii</i>, because you 
begin by presupposing the thing to be proved.  This has been the general 
verdict concerning St. Anselm's argument, although there have been in 
every century some who maintained, and there are still many who 
maintain, that it is a valid proof.  The necessity of repelling Kant's 
attacks against all metaphysical ideas caused men to consider more 
attentively the objective character of our mental conceptions, and it 
cannot be affirmed with absolute certainty that there is no possibility 
of making the argument valid by justifying the apparent transition from 
the ideal to the real.<p> 

However this may be, St. Anselm's title to fame and to our gratitude is 
not based on this argument alone.  He rendered signal services to the 
cause of truth by determining the place which reason should occupy in 
investigating the truths of faith.  These services mark an epoch, and 
bring out the most important features of the first period of 
Scholasticism.<p>

First, he was called upon to refute the Nominalism of Roscelin (1009), 
which Anselm called a dialectical heresy, and which became an error in 
faith when Roscelin applied his theory to the mystery of the Trinity.  
Since he did not admit the existence of an idea common to many 
individuals, saying that universals were mere sounds of the voice -- 
<i>flatus vocis</i> -- Roscelin denied that there was one divine nature 
common to the three Persons of the Trinity. From this it followed that 
there were three Gods -- three substances (<i>tres res</i>) -- each 
possessing divine nature.  In this we see how easily mistakes which at 
first seem to be merely philosophical errors can be applied to the 
doctrines of faith.<p>

<A NAME="Dispu"><b>Disputes about Universals.</b></a> -- Apart from 
this relation to faith, it must not be supposed for an instant that the 
dispute about the nature of universal ideas involved nothing more than 
a quibble about words.  "The principles involved lie at the very 
foundation of human science, inasmuch as on its issue depends the 
possibility or impossibility of any demonstration whatsoever within the 
scope of knowledge accessible to man."  The truth of this remark, made 
by Alzog in his "Church History,"<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n8">[8]</a> is 
borne out by the history of philosophy.  Idealism, Scepticism, modern 
Pantheism, Traditionalism, and Ontologism can all be traced to false 
conception about universals.  Without entering deeply into this 
question, the dispute and the different opinions may be summed up as 
follows:<p> 

By the senses we perceive particular objects, such as John Smith, that 
tree, that horse, etc.; and the ideas, or representations of such 
objects in our minds are <i>particular ideas</i>.  Besides these 
particular ideas, we have in our intellect ideas of something which is 
common to many individuals whereby they may be classed together, as 
when we speak of men, trees, etc.  Individual beings are the direct 
objects of our senses; the universals are the direct objects of the 
intellect.  We see, e.g., the individual men, trees, horses, etc., and 
the intellect forms the abstract idea of man, substance, life, cause, 
effect, roundness, whiteness, and the like.<p>

<A NAME="Nomin"><b>Nominalists.</b></a> -- The Nominalists say there 
are no such ideas, and the distinctions just enumerated are mere sounds 
of the voice, corresponding to no external reality.<p> 

<A NAME="Conce"><b>Conceptualists.</b></a> -- The Conceptualists found 
it easy to refute them, saying with truth: Words mean nothing unless 
they signify a conception of the mind; hence the universal ideas exist 
as <i>concepts</i> by which the mind represents to itself all the 
individuals of a class, collectively and individually, but there is 
nothing in the individuals corresponding to the universal idea in the 
mind.<p> 

<A NAME="Reali"><b>Realists.</b></a> -- The Realists say: Our 
conceptions would be false if there were not in the things represented 
something corresponding to the representation in the mind; hence 
humanity, and the nature of a tree, and whiteness, etc., really exist 
in individual men, trees, and white objects.<p> 

<A NAME="Willi"><b>William of Champeaux.</b></a> -- William of 
Champeaux and his followers carried this conclusion too far, and held 
that the universals were the only realities; hence the universals 
actually exist in the individuals, which are only appearances or 
modifications of the universals.<p> 

The <i>true opinion</i>, defended by St. Anselm and adopted by all the 
great Scholastics, is a happy medium between Conceptualism and the 
exaggerated Realism of William of Champeaux.  There is something in the 
individuals corresponding to the universal ideas in the mind; the 
universals are real, otherwise they could not be predicated of the 
individuals; it would not be true to say, e.g., Peter is a man, since 
the equivalent of that proposition is this: Peter has in him that which 
is represented in my mind by the concept of human nature.  But, in the 
individuals, that nature is particular and incommunicable; in the mind, 
it is abstract and universal.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n9">[9]</a>  Hence 
the representation of a universal is not a mere thought of the mind, but 
the representation of a truth and of a reality; because a tree, e.g., 
has in it the nature of a tree, which nature is represented in my mind 
as abstract and universal -- common to all trees.  The question is 
fundamental in Metaphysics.<p> 

<A NAME="Kant"><b>Kant.</b></a> -- Kant, who attacked Metaphysics in 
the eighteenth century, began by denying the objective reality of 
metaphysical concepts, and he thereby became the parent of a school of 
subjectivists, idealists, and sceptics, whose false theories affected, 
and still affect, all systems of philosophy that abandoned the 
teachings and the methods of the Scholastics.<p> 

<A NAME="Tradi"><b>Traditionalism and Ontologism.</b></a> -- 
Traditionalism and Ontologism would never have been accepted if some 
writers had not been too timid to assert boldly that there is a reality 
corresponding to our metaphysical or universal ideas.<p> 

<A NAME="St.An"><b>St. Anselm's Works.</b></a> -- St. Anselm's best 
known works are his "Monologium" (Soliloquy) and the "Prosologium" 
(Continuation of Meditations).  In these works he carefully 
distinguished faith from reason, and became a living and influential 
opponent of the rationalistic tendencies which had been excited by the 
writings of Scotus Erigena.  He did more.  In the two works just 
mentioned, and in his treatises on the Trinity, the Incarnation, the 
Procession of the Holy Ghost, on the Sin of Satan, on Original Sin, and 
"De Conceptu Virginali," he laid the foundations of scientific 
theology.<p> 

"Hitherto," writes Mother Drane, "ecclesiastical writers had, for the 
most part, been content to gather up and reproduce the traditionary 
wisdom of the Fathers; but now, when those traditions had become firmly 
established, a scientific superstructure was to be raised on that broad 
foundation, and the theology of the Church was to be built up into a 
compact and well-ordered system.  This was the work of the scholostic 
theologians, of whom St. Anselm may be considered the first."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n10">[10]</a><p> 

To appreciate fully the services that he rendered, it must be borne in 
mind that he was a pioneer in the field in which he labored.  
Philosophy had been cultivated in Greece and Rome.  The Christian 
Apologists had used reason, had used it well, in defence of their 
faith.  The Fathers of the Church were not strangers to the learning 
and literature of their times; they were fearless giants, ready at all 
times to compete with the most powerful adversaries of Christianity.  
But the defence and explanation of Christian truths had not attained 
the perfection of a compact and well-ordered system.  Many timid souls 
feared to use what was good in the works of the pagan philosophers.  
The schoolmaster, however, was abroad in the land: scholars would be 
misled if their studies were not properly directed; there was need of a 
saint and scholar who could direct philosophical studies with the 
assurance that the use of reason would not be detrimental to the 
Christian faith.  This St. Anselm did by his character and career, as 
well as by his writings, which inaugurated, in the Western Church, the 
systematic explanation and defence of Christian doctrine.  He was a 
pioneer in determining the true relations between faith and reason, 
showing that one could be at the same time a great philosopher and a 
good Christian.  Later we shall see how St. Thomas perfected the system 
which St. Anselm built upon the works of St. Augustine, Boethius and 
the early Christian Apologists.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n11">[11]</a><p>

The work begun by St. Anselm was continued by Peter Lombard, Albertus 
Magnus, Alexander of Hales, St. Bonaventure and St. Thomas of Aquin, to 
whom the world is indebted for those celebrated <i>Summae</i>,<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n12">[12]</a>  or <i>Manuals of Theology</i>, which served 
as the models of all subsequent theological treatises.<p> 

To St. Anselm is due the honor of inaugurating this important 
scientific movement, and for this reason he has been called the "Father 
of the Scholastics."<p>
