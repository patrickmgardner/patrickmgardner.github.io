<H1>The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas</h1>

A <i>Summa Theologica</i> is, broadly speaking, a compendium, summary, 
or manual of theology.  There is not in the English language an exact 
equivalent of the Latin word <i>Summa</i> as it was used by medieval 
writers.  Perhaps the words "Complete Manual" would best convey to 
people using our language the idea which was in the minds of those who 
invented the Latin term.  We always think of a compendium, or summary, 
as of a book or <i>Excerpta,</i> in which many things are omitted, some 
of these being either necessary or important.  In a Summa there must be 
no such omissions.  Things may be left out which properly would find a 
place only in a compete elucidation and development of a subject 
considered in all its aspects; but the Summa must contain a statement, 
explanation and proof of all that is necessary for the comprehension of 
the subject as a whole and in all its essential parts.  Some latitude 
is allowed in the choice of divisions, arguments and illustrations.  
Summae composed by different men treating the same subject may not be 
similar in all respects.  In all cases, however, the doctrine must be 
complete, briefly stated, sufficiently proved, illustrated and 
defended.  Many such books were composed in the Middle Ages, some 
dealing with history, some with philosophy, some with theology or 
kindred subjects, the best known and most important of these being the 
<i>Summa Theologica</i> of St. Thomas Aquinas (see Catholic 
Encyclopedia, <i>s.v. Summae</i>).<p> 

Nearly six and a half centuries have passed since the death of St. 
Thomas (d. 1274), and yet his work is still considered the simplest and 
most perfect sketch of universal theology to be found in any language.  
Its value is recognized not only by Catholics but also by outsiders, 
even by the enemies of revealed religion.  On this subject readers are 
referred to the Encyclical Letter "AEterni Patris," of Leo XIII and to 
the article "Thomas Aquinas, Saint," in the Catholic Encyclopedia.  St. 
Thomas' renowned work is a Summa in the best sense of the word.  In it 
nothing is superfluous, nothing is wanting.  It is a compendious, but 
complete, exposition of sacred doctrine, written in language so clear 
and concise that one is in constant admiration of the genius and 
sanctity of one who could express so well his knowledge of God and all 
things pertaining to God.  Pope Pius X, shortly before his death, viz., 
in June, 1914, issued a document imposing the obligation of using the 
Summa of St. Thomas as the text-book in all higher schools in Italy and 
the adjacent islands which enjoyed the privilege of conferring academic 
degrees in theology.  All institutions failing to comply with the 
Pontifical order within three years were to be deprived of the power to 
confer degrees.  It is not probably that Benedict XV, an admirer of Leo 
XIII and a friend of Pius X, will revoke or modify the decree of his 
saintly predecessor.  The Summa of St. Thomas is still a living and 
valuable book.<p> 

The following pages cannot claim to be even a good summary of its 
merits and excellencies; they are simply a few pertinent remarks which 
will be interesting, it is hoped, and modestly helpful to two classes 
of readers.  For students of theology they will serve as an 
introduction and an incentive to deeper study of a work which cannot be 
fully known and appreciated until the general plan and all details of 
the execution have been examined in a close and reverent inspection of 
the immortal pages penned by the Angelic Doctor.  For those who are not 
students of theology these sketches will furnish a coveted peep into 
the treasury where so many riches are said to be stored.  To those who 
are not familiar with the Latin language the Summa of St. Thomas has 
been as a sealed book.  Translations of the full text into French and 
English are now in course of publication (see Catholic Encyclopedia, 
l.c.), and soon will afford our laymen an opportunity to learn more 
about the great medieval theologian's immortal work.  For the benefit 
of both classes of readers it has been considered opportune to publish 
the plan of the Summa both in Latin and English.  The chart facing page 
87 gives in St. Thomas' own words the plan which he followed in writing 
on God in Himself, and on God as the Alpha and Omega -- the beginning 
and end of all things, especially of rational beings.  <A 
HREF="summa.htm">The same plan, translated into English is given at 
page 109</a>.  These two charts, in their wonderful simplicity and 
grandeur, are more valuable than any words of explanation and comment.  
For the benefit of those who desire to know more about St. Thomas and 
his Summa there is added a short bibliography which will be helpful 
both to students and general readers.  Sincere thanks are due to the 
Editor of the <i>Catholic University Bulletin</i> for the permission, 
graciously granted, to reprint the following pages.<p> 

<A NAME="TheSu"><b>The Summa and the Catechism.</b></a> -- "The 
Catholic Church," writes Ozanam, a distinguished modern author, 
"possesses two incomparable monuments, the Catechism and the <i>Summa 
Theologica</i> (Sum of Theology) of St. Thomas Aquinas; one is for the 
unlettered (persons of ordinary capacity), the other is for the 
learned."  The truth of this remark is admitted by all theologians who 
have studied and examined the Summa of St. Thomas after having learned, 
as we must learn, the outlines of the Christian religion from that dear 
little book, the Catechism.  The Catechism contains a compendious 
enumeration and short explanations of the principal doctrines of the 
Christian religion; the Summa of St. Thomas contains a complete list of 
those same doctrines, explained and developed and defended by the 
genius of a Master who is universally recognized as the "Prince of 
Theologians."  Had St. Thomas written nothing but his theology, his 
name would have been immortal, because nothing new is said in stating 
that the "Summa Theologica" is universally admitted to be the greatest 
masterpiece of human genius that the world has ever known.  This work 
contains the cream of St. Thomas' philosophy and theology, being in 
reality a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, or sum, of all his other writings; it 
represents the perfection of the human mind in its application to the 
truths of faith, the perfection of Christian philosophy and theology.  
Those who read it are filled with enthusiastic admiration for the 
author, and they know not which should be more admired, the grandeur of 
the plan or the extraordinary genius manifested in the execution of the 
grand conception.<p> 

<A NAME="Lacor"><b>Lacordair compares the Summa to the 
Pyramids.</b></a> -- "Shall I attempt," exclaims Fr. Lacordaire, 
speaking of St. Thomas, "shall I attempt to describe this man and his 
work?  As well might I attempt to give a perfect idea of the pyramids 
by telling their height and breadth.  If you wish to know the pyramids, 
be not content with listening to a description; cross the seas; go to 
the land where so many conquerors have left their footprints; go into 
the sandy deserts, and there behold standing before you something 
solemn, something grand, something calm, immutable and profoundly 
simple -- the pyramids!"  St. Thomas' Summa, in its majestic simplicity 
may well be compared to the grandest of the pyramids.  We may look upon 
it with admiring eyes; but no tongue can tell, no pen can adequately 
describe the wonders of its simple grandeur; it is the masterpiece of a 
genius who has had neither a superior nor an equal.  This great manual 
of theology comes to us from that much maligned thirteenth century, of 
which Vaughan writes:  "The masterpieces of medieval science were 
produced at the very time that the great architectural masterpieces 
were conceived and at least partially realized."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n65">[65]</a>  The thirteenth century was an age of 
construction as well as of destruction.  The men of those days upset 
and destroyed many idols of preceding centuries; but in their stead 
they constructed imperishable monuments both in the material and in the 
intellectual world, which to this day excite the unbounded admiration 
of all lovers of true genius; and the architects of our day would be 
happy if they could produce something worthy of being compared to the 
great cathedrals and churches and libraries and town-halls which were 
conceived and executed by the architects of the Middle Ages.  This is a 
special manner true of the greatest of all masterpieces of medieval 
science, the Summa of St. Thomas.  No writer of theology has attempted 
to make an improvement upon this greatest of all manuals of theology.  
The Church, guided by the Holy Ghost, has held her councils and has 
issued instructions and definitions to which not even the most 
enthusiastic admirer of St. Thomas would dare compare his writings when 
there is a question of a teacher that is infallible as well as 
accurate; but it is a fact well known to theologians that many of those 
definitions were taken almost verbatim from the works of St. Thomas.  
Amongst men the Summa has been looked upon as the groundwork and model 
for all theologies written since his time, and the greatest praise that 
could be bestowed upon any philosophy or theology consists in saying 
that the book really deserves to bear on the title-page the 
inscription:  "ad mentem D. Thomae" -- in other words, that it was 
formed on the model of St. Thomas and really represents his 
teachings.<p> 

<A NAME="Whend"><b>When did St. Thomas resolve to write the 
Summa?</b></a> -- It is impossible to determine at what epoch in his 
lifetime St. Thomas resolved to write the Summa.  We know that in his 
infancy those who cared for him were frequently astonished on hearing 
the child ask, with unexpected seriousness, "What is God?"  It may be 
supposed that thus early in life grace was perfecting nature in this 
favored child, preparing him gradually to become in due time the most 
distinguished representative of that science which takes its name from 
God, of whom it treats.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n66">[66]</a>  His sojourn 
at Monte Cassino, his studies at Naples, his reading of the Scriptures 
and of Aristotle, his study of the "Sentences," in which Peter Lombard 
gave a compendium of the most important texts of the Fathers relating 
to theology, his training under Albertus Magnus, who was deeply 
impressed with the order and accuracy of Aristotle's writings, and who 
was himself fond of experimenting and of collecting materials for 
rebuilding the edifice of philosophy and theology -- all this tended to 
prepare St. Thomas for giving to the world what Ozanam calls "a vast 
synthesis of the moral sciences, in which was unfolded all that could 
be known of God, of man, and their mutal relations, a truly Catholic 
philosophy."<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n67">[67]</a><p> 

<A NAME="Origi"><b>Origin of the Summa.</b></a> -- In preceding 
chapters something was said of the chaos produced at Paris and 
elsewhere by the introduction of new studies and new methods into the 
universities.  With brilliant professors anxious to obtain fame by 
giving their names to new systems, with Averroes' commentaries on 
Aristotle regarded at Paris as the perfection of philosophical 
knowledge, with rationalism and pantheism publicly taught by professors 
of a Catholic university, with contempt for old systems and the love of 
novelty growing in the minds of men, while the sweet and pious mystics 
of the school of St. Victor sought to induce men to give up "philosophy 
and empty fallacies" in order to return to the contemplation of 
heavenly truths and the study of the Scriptures, there was a confusion 
that puzzled even learned theologians, and poor beginners could do 
nothing but follow the systems of their masters.<p> 

<A NAME="Influ"><b>Influence of Albertus Magnus on St. Thomas.</b></a> 
-- St. Thomas was a witness of this confusion.  He had not suffered as 
much as others from the disordered state of philosophy and theology, 
because he had enjoyed the advantage of being instructed under a master 
whose clear vision was not dimmed by the darkness which surrounded him.  
Albertus Magnus -- "honor to whom honor is due" -- pointed out to St. 
Thomas the dangers and the needs of the thirteenth century, and to him 
principally, under God, we are indebted for the immortal Summa.  
Although St. Thomas himself had not experienced the difficulties under 
which others labored, he knew what those difficulties were, and he 
resolved with all due humility, and with the hope of assistance from 
heaven, to write a book that would be a remedy for the confusion and 
uncertainty which prevented students from forming a clear conception of 
the doctrines of Christianity.<p> 

<A NAME="TheSu"><b>The Summa written for Beginners.</b></a> -- In 
making this statement there is no necessity of drawing upon the 
imagination or of resorting to <i>ex post facto</i> suppositions.  St. 
Thomas himself tells us -- the declaration will perhaps surprise those 
who hear it for the first time -- that his Summa was written for the 
special benefit of students; of beginners, as we call them.  This 
declaration was made in the Prologue to the Summa.  "We have 
reflected," he writes, "that beginners in this sacred science find many 
impediments in those things which have been written by divers authors; 
partly on account of the multiplication of useless questions, articles 
and arguments, partly because those things which are necessary for the 
education of novices are not treated according to the order of 
discipline (scientific order), but as the exposition of certain books 
or the occasion of dispute demanded, and partly because the frequent 
repetitions beget confusion and disgust in the minds of the learners."  
Those "impediments," or trials of beginners as we may call them, St. 
Thomas wished to avoid, hence he adds:  "I shall endeavor, trusting to 
the assistance of heaven, to treat of those things that pertain to this 
sacred science with brevity and with clearness, in so far as the 
subject to be treated will permit."<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n68">[68]</a><p> 

These are St. Thomas' few plain and simple words of introduction to his 
immortal Sum of all theology.  They contain a promise, and never was a 
promise more faithfully fulfilled.  He did not write simply in order to 
explain or refute books that had been written before his time.  He did 
not wish to make a show of learning by heaping up useless questions and 
arguments, thereby causing great confusion in the minds of his readers.  
No, with humble confidence in the Almighty, he intended to use the 
talents that God had given him to compose a complete, but at the same 
time brief and lucid, exposition of the truths made known by 
revelation.  In other words, he promised to write a scientifically 
arranged theology, and he fulfilled his promise in such a manner as to 
become the Prince and master of all theologians, with no one to dispute 
his claim to the title.<p> 

<A NAME="Quest"><b>Question I.  Sacred Doctrine.</b></a> -- After these 
few preliminary remarks, which, by the way, contain more than many a 
long-winded preface, as prefaces are often written, the Angelic Doctor 
enters into the consideration of his subject, beginning with an 
introductory question on Sacred Doctrine, by which term he means either 
revelation in general, or theology in particular.<p> 

Besides philosophy which can be known by reason, he says, revelation is 
also necessary for the human race, first because without revelation men 
could know nothing of the supernatural end to which they must tend, and 
secondly, without revelation even the truths concerning God which could 
be proved by reason, would be known only by a few, after a long time 
and with the admixture of many errors (Art. I, cf. Vat. Council, Const. 
"Dei Filius," c.2).<p> 

<A NAME="Whati"><b>What is Scholastic Theology?</b></a> -- The 
principles of revelation having been once received, the mind of man 
proceeds to explain them and to draw conclusions from what was 
revealed.  From this results in man's mind theology properly so-called, 
which is a science, speculative and practical, higher in dignity than 
the other sciences, deserving to be called wisdom, because the 
principles from which it proceeds are made known by revelation which 
manifests God as the highest cause of all things (art. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).  
The object, or subject, of this science is God; all other things are 
treated in it only in so far as they relate to God (art. 7).  Reason is 
used in theology not to prove the truths of faith -- which are accepted 
on the authority of God -- but to defend, explain and develop the 
doctrines which have been revealed (art. 8).  Revelation is made known 
to us by the Sacred Scriptures.  God, the author of the Scriptures, 
embraces all things in His infinite mind; and when He deigns to speak 
to man, if we take into account the intention of God, considering the 
spiritual or mystical as well as the literal sense of the words, a 
single text of Scripture may contain a world of meaning (art. 9, 
10).<p> 

<A NAME="Plano"><b>Plan of the Summa.</b></a> -- Having laid down these 
principles, St. Thomas announces the order he intends to observe in his 
theology.  This is one of the most important features of the Summa.  In 
ten lines of a half column, as the words are printed in the Migne 
edition of his works,  the Angel of the Schools sketches that wonderful 
plan which introduced unity into all theological treatises.  Under 
three headings he classifies all the parts of dogmatic and moral 
theology; not one of them can be omitted in a complete theology; it is 
not necessary to add another, because they embrace everything, they 
cover the whole field.<p> 

<A NAME="Gener"><b>General Outlines.</b></a> -- Now, what are those 
three headings, those three leading ideas?  "Since the principal object 
of sacred doctrine is to give the knowledge of <i>God,</i> not only as 
he is in Himself, but also as He is the <i>Beginning</i> of all things 
and the <i>End</i> of them all, especially of rational beings, we shall 
treat first, of God; secondly, of the tendency of the rational creature 
to God, and thirdly, of Christ, who as man is the way by which we tend 
to God."  This is the grand division, these are the general outlines of 
the "Summa Theologica."  God in Himself and as He is the Creator; God 
as the End of all things, especially of man; God as the Redeemer -- 
these are the leading ideas under which all that pertains to theology 
is contained.<p> 

<A NAME="Subdi"><b>Subdivision; 1a Pars.</b></a> -- The First part, of 
God in himself and of God as Creator, is subdivided into three tracts.  
(1) Of those things which pertain to the essence of God, (2) the 
distinction of persons in God, i.e., on the Trinity, (3) of the 
procession of creatures from God; under which St. Thomas treats (1) of 
the production of creatures, (2) of the distinction of creatures, (3) 
of the preservation and government of creatures.  Under the heading of 
the distinction, he treats of the distinction of creatures, (1) in 
general and (2) in particular, i.e., of good and evil, of creatures 
that are purely spiritual (the angels), of creatures that are purely 
corporeal (the material world), and of man, who is composed of body and 
spirit.  This makes in all nine tracts in the first part:  (1) On the 
essence of the one God.  (2) On the Trinity.  (3) On the creation. (4) 
On the distinction of things in general.  (5) On the distinction of 
good and evil.  (6) On the angels.  (7) On purely corporeal creatures.  
(8) On Man.  (9) On the preservation and government of the world.<p> 

<A NAME="2aPar"><b>2a Pars.</b></a> -- The Second part, which treats of 
the tendency of rational creatures to God, <i>i.e., of God as He is the 
end of man,</i> contains the moral theology of St. Thomas or his 
treatise on the end of man and on human acts.  It is subdivided into 
two parts knowns as the 1a 2ae and the 2a 2ae, or the First of the 
Second, and the Second of the Second.  The first five questions of the 
2a pars are devoted to proving that man's last end, or his beatitude, 
consists in the possession of God.  Man attains to that end or deviates 
from it by human acts, of which he treats, first in general (in all but 
the first five questions of the prima secundae), secondly, in 
particular (in the whole of the 2a 2ae).<p> 

The treatise on human acts in general is divided into two parts, (1) on 
human acts in themselves, (2) on the principles or causes of those 
acts.  Of the acts performed by man some are peculiar to him as man, 
others are common to him and the lower animals; hence St. Thomas 
speaks, (1) of human acts, (2) of the passions.  Here I may pause to 
remark that in these two tracts,  St. Thomas, following Aristotle, 
gives the most perfect description and the keenest analysis of the 
movements of man's mind and heart that ever came from the pen of man.<p> 

The principles (or causes) of human acts are <i>intrinsic</i> or 
<i>extrinsic</i>.  The intrinsic principles are the <i>faculties</i> of 
the soul and <i>habits</i>.  The faculties of the soul were explained 
in the first part, in treating of the soul of man; hence in the prima 
secundae St. Thomas considers habits, first, in general, then, in 
particular, i.e., the virtues and vices, in explaining which his power 
of analysis is again displayed in a remarkable manner.  The extrinsic 
principles of human acts are <i>the devil</i> who tempts us, and 
<i>God,</i> who instructs us by His <i>laws</i> and moves us by His 
<i>grace</i>.  Of the temptation of the demons St. Thomas treated in 
the first part, when he was explaining God's manner of governing the 
world.  The prima secundae closes with the treatise on laws and on 
grace.<p> 

2a 2ae.  The second part of the second treats of the virtues and vices 
in particular.  In it St. Thomas treats first of those things which 
pertain to <i>all men,</i> no matter what may be their station in life; 
secondly, of those things which pertain to <i>some men</i> only.  
Things that pertain to all men are reduced by St. Thomas to seven 
headings:  faith, hope and charity -- the three <i>theological 
virtues</i> -- prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance -- the four 
<i>cardinal</i> or principal moral virtues.  Under each title St. 
Thomas, in order as he himself tells us, to avoid frequent repetitions, 
treats not only of the virtue itself, but also of the vices opposed to 
it, of the commandment given to practise it, and of the gift of the 
Holy Ghost which corresponds to it.  Under the second heading -- of 
those things which pertain to some men only -- St. Thomas treats first 
of the <i>graces freely given</i> by Almighty God, to certain 
individuals for the good of the Church, such as the gift of tongues, 
prophecy, the power to work miracles, etc.  Secondly, of the <i>active 
and contemplative life</i>.  Thirdly, of <i>particular states</i> in 
life, and of the duties of those who are in different stations, 
especially of bishops and religious.<p> 

<A NAME="3aPar"><b>3a Pars.</b></a> -- In the third part of his Summa, 
St. Thomas treats of our Blessed Redeemer and of the benefits which he 
confers upon man; hence the three tracts; first, on the 
<i>Incarnation</i> and on what our Saviour did and suffered when He was 
on earth; second, on the <i>Sacraments,</i> which were instituted by 
our Saviour and have their efficacy from his merits and sufferings; and 
the third, on the <i>end of the world,</i> the resurrection of our 
bodies, judgment, the punishment of the wicked, and the everlasting 
happiness of those who through the merits of Christ are brought back to 
the bosom of God.  <p> 

These are the grand outlines of the Summa, which was the first, and 
which remains to this day the most perfect, scientifically arranged 
theology that was ever written.  I have said nothing of the 
subdivisions under each grand heading; they bear the impress of the 
same all-embracing and penetrating mind which conceived the general 
plan.  The Summa contains 38 tracts, 631 questions and about 3,000 
articles, in which more than 10,000 objections are answered.  Take up 
any one of these articles, and by referring to the beginning of the 
treatise you can see at a glance what place it occupies in the general 
plan, which embraces all that can be known of <i>God,</i> of 
<i>man,</i> and of <i>their mutual relations.</i>  This scientific 
arrangement of questions is one of the most prominent features of the 
Summa, and the making out of this plan was in itself a greater benefit 
to theology than anything that had been done before or has been done 
since the time of St. Thomas.  Writers who preceded St. Thomas had 
deserved well of religion and of the Church; they had written wisely 
and well, and to some of those who immediately preceded him or were 
contemporary with him must be given the credit of having prepared the 
way for the Summa by collecting the materials which he moulded into one 
vast synthesis; but they had not written a scientific theology.  Those 
who came after St. Thomas have deemed it an honor and a pleasure to 
follow the order of the Summa.  They may have added some new 
developments or cited some facts and definitions which came after the 
thirteenth century, but they have never dreamed of attempting to write 
a better theology.  St. Thomas remains the master and the model; the 
nearer they approach to him, the better right they have to be 
considered good theologians.<p> 

It must not be supposed, however, that all the excellencies of the 
Summa have been enumerated when the general plan has been pointed out 
and a short list has been given of the principal questions treated in 
it.  St. Thomas was not only a great architect, he was also a practical 
builder and he attended with the greatest diligence to every detail of 
the grand edifice which he constructed.  Reading over his works we 
involuntarily exclaim:  Verily Pope John XXII expressed a truth when he 
said that St. Thomas wrought as many miracles as he wrote articles.<p>

<A NAME="TheSt"><b>The Style of the Summa.</b></a> -- Let us consider, 
for instance, the style of his writings.  The style of St. Thomas is 
something unique and inimitable; it is a most extraoardinary 
combination of brevity, accuracy and completeness.  The Scholastics 
generally were not so careful of style as were the predecessors in the 
learned world; they were more solicitous about their thoughts than 
about the language in which their ideas were expressed.  Hence the 
lamentations of John of Salisbury, who was a finished classical scholar 
and a writer of elegantly polished letters.<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n69">[69]</a>  St. Thomas' style is a medium between 
the rough expressiveness of the ordinary Scholastic and the almost 
fastidious elegance of John of Salisbury.  We know that his hymns in 
honor of the Blessed Sacrament are incomparably grand and beautiful.  
Santeuil said he would give all the verses he ever wrote for the 
following words of the "Verbum Supernum," which immediately precede the 
"O Salutaris":<p> 

         Se nascens dedit socium<br>
         Convescens in edulium<br>
         Se moriens in pretium<br>
         Se regnans dat in praemium.<A 
HREF="staampfn.htm#n70">[70]</a><p> 

But I am speaking of his style of writing on philosophy and theology, 
concerning which Pope Innocent declared that, with the exception of the 
canonical writings, the works of St. Thomas surpass all others in 
accuracy of expression.  In a few well chosen words he tells all that 
one wishes to know on a question, and after reading all that others 
have written, students return to St. Thomas, who always gives something 
satisfactory.  No one can appreciate this without actually reading the 
writings of St. Thomas.  For the sake of comparison I should like to 
see some modern authors attempt to put into a given space as much 
accurate and satisfactory information as St. Thomas usually gives in 
the space of one article.  Bossuet, Lacordaire and Monsabr&eacute;, 
three of the greatest of authors, studied and admired St. Thomas' 
style, and in reading their discourses we can recognize the influence 
of the Angelic Doctor.  Writers on philosophy and theology have studied 
his style; they could not imitate it, because it is <i>sui generis,</i> 
possessing an excellence which makes it inimitable.  Cajetan knew his 
style better than any of his disciples, yet Cajetan is beneath St. 
Thomas in clearness and accuracy of expression, in depth and solidity 
of judgment.<p> 

<A NAME="Sound"><b>Sound Judgment.</b></a> -- This soundness and 
soberness of judgment in another characteristic of St. Thomas.  It is a 
well known fact that St. Thomas was noted for his singular calmness and 
meekness; even under the most trying circumstances he never lost his 
temper, notwithstanding the many provocations he met with in his life 
as a student, as a professor, and as a champion of the religious orders 
against the malicious attacks of William of St. Amour.  This quiet 
self-possession runs through all his writings, so much so that every 
candid reader, even though he paid no attention to the supernatural 
meekness and humility of a saintly disciple of Jesus, would be 
compelled to admire him as a perfect specimen of the philosopher with a 
well-balanced mind.  St. Thomas was full of what we take delight in 
praising as good, sound sense.  He and Albertus Magnus introduced new 
methods into the schools.  Besides praising and making known the works 
of Aristotle, upon which some looked with suspicion, they insisted on 
the necessity of experiment and observation in an age when men too 
often contented themselves with reading what had been written by 
others.<p> 

In philosophy, says St. Thomas, arguments from authority are of 
secondary importance (2 Sent. Dist. 14, Art. 2, ad. 1); experiment, and 
reason the thing out for yourself, and do not swear by the words of a 
master.  "Philosophy does not consist in knowing what men said but in 
knowing the truth."  We now understand the importance of this 
principle; perhaps we should not have understood it so well, and might 
not have proposed it so courageously had we lived in the middle of the 
thirteenth century.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n71">[71]</a>  The good 
judgment of St. Thomas is displayed in a remarkable manner in settling 
disputed questions.  If he tells you that he is certain of the truth of 
his solution, you may rest assured that his arguments are convincing; 
otherwise he will simply give an opinion, stating that it is probably 
or more probable than the opposite; or he will admit that the question 
is doubtful, and then he suspends judgment.  He does not hesitate at 
times to say plainly:  This is something about which we know nothing, 
differing in this from many of his time and of our times who foolishly 
imagine that it is unphilosophical to say:  "I don't know."  On 
reflection we know that judgments should be formed in accordance with 
the nature of the arguments adduced, but as a matter of fact very few 
writers observe this rule.  St. Thomas observed it invariably, and for 
this reason he has always been considered a safe guide, because he 
judged always in justice and in truth.  <p> 

<A NAME="NoExc"><b>No Excellence Without Labor.</b></a> -- It would be 
a mistake to suppose that St. Thomas attained to this perfection of 
scholastic writing without an effort, and that he affords an exception 
to the general rule expressed in the old saying:  "There is no 
excellence without labor."  He was indeed a singularly blessed genius, 
but he was also an indefatigable worker, and by continued application 
he reached that stage of perfection in the art of writing where the art 
disappears.  Some years ago the Abb&eacute; Ucceli published a 
facsimile of the original manuscript of the "Summa Contra Gentiles."  
The text was corrected and changed in almost as many places as it 
remained intact, thus proving that even the genius of St. Thomas was 
not dispensed from the law of labor in attaining to excellence.<p> 

Another remarkable feature of the Summa is St. Thomas' wonderful 
knowledge of the Scriptures, of the Councils of the Church, of the 
Works of the Fathers and the writings of the philosophers.  He seems to 
have read everything and to have understood everything.  Father Daniel 
d'Agusta once pressed him to say what he considered the greatest grace 
he had ever received from God (sanctifying grace, of course, excepted).  
"I think, that of having understood whatever I have read," he replied, 
after a few minutes of reflection.  St. Antoninus says in his Life, 
that "he remembered everything he had once read, so that his mind was 
like a huge library."  Whoever has read the Summa will at once admit 
the truth of these statements.<p>

<A NAME="Scrip"><b>Scripture.</b></a> -- St. Thomas must have known by 
heart the greater portion of the Scriptures.  There is scarcely an 
article of the Summa that does not contain quotations from the 
Scriptures, and frequently he takes pains to explain the meaning of 
obscure passages.  It must be borne in mind that he wrote at a time 
when there was no such book as a "Concordance," or a "Thesaurus 
Biblicus," or "Divine Armory of the Holy Scriptures," or other books of 
that kind which make it easy for writers of our times to fill their 
pages with quotations from the holy writings.  Not only did he know the 
Scriptures themselves, he was also acquainted with the Commentaries on 
the sacred text; and whenever it was necessary or useful, he was 
prepared to give the different opinions of various authors, sometimes 
refuting their interpretations, sometimes leaving the reader free to 
choose for himself from several interpretations, all of which were 
considered equally good.  The bare enumeration of texts quoted or 
explained in the Summa fills eighty small-print columns in the Migne 
edition of his works, and it is supposed by many that St. Thomas 
learned the Scriptures by heart while he was imprisoned in the Castle 
of St. Giovanni, shortly after he received the habit of the Order of 
St. Dominic.<p> 

<A NAME="Tradi"><b>Tradition.</b></a> -- He was also filled with the 
deepest veneration for all the traditions of the Church.  He was a man 
of intense faith, and no arguments had greater weight with him than 
those taken from the <i>consuetudo ecclesiae</i> -- the practice of the 
Church, which, he said, should prevail over the authority of any Doctor 
(2a 2ae, Q.X.A. 12).  This same spirit of faith is manifested in his 
quotations from the Acts of Councils, the Definitions of the Roman 
Pontiffs, and the works of the Holy Fathers.  His acquaintance with 
these important souces of theological arguments is astonishing, 
especially when we remember that books were very rare and precious in 
his time -- two centuries before the invention of printing.  In the 
"Summa Theologica" he quotes from nineteen Councils, forty-one Popes, 
and fifty-two Fathers of the Church or learned Doctors.  Among the 
Fathers, his favorite is St. Augustine, whose opinions, however, he 
does not always adopt, when St. Augustine puts forth a private opinion 
and is not bearing witness to a doctrine that was handed down from the 
ancients.  In departing from St. Augustine's opinion he usually, 
through respect for that Father, refrains from mentioning his name, 
preferring that the readers should not be unnecessarily reminded of the 
fact that even St. Augustine made some mistakes.<p> 

<A NAME="Philo"><b>Philosophers.</b></a> -- In the introduction to the 
Summa, St. Thomas lays down the principle that a theologian can make 
use of the writings of philosophers, not indeed as if theology needed 
them, but because she has the right to use them as her servants (Q. 1, 
Art. 5 ad. 2) in order to illustrate the truth of faith (Q. 1, Art. 8, 
ad. 2).  Acting on this principle he extensively used the works of the 
pagan philosophers and poets in order to render more intelligible and 
attractive his explanations of Christian doctrines and practices.  In 
the Summa he quotes from the writings of forty-six philosophers and 
poets, Aristotle, Plato and Boethius being his favorite authorities.  
From Aristotle he learned that love of order and accuracy of expression 
which are the most conspicuous features of the Summa.  From Boethius he 
learned that Aristotle's works could be used without detriment to 
Christianity; and in the works of that philosopher he found several 
exact definitions which he adopted, and which are still used in the 
schools of theology (def. of Person and of Eternity).  He did not 
follow Boethius in his vain attempt to reconcile Plato and Aristotle.  
St. Thomas saw that the teachings of those two great philosophers were 
not the same, especially in regard to the nature of universal ideas and 
the union of the soul and body in man.  He adopted Aristotle's 
doctrines on those subjects, and in general the Stagyrite was his 
master; but the elevation and grandeur of St. Thomas' conceptions, and 
the majestic dignity which characterizes all his writings speak to us 
of the great and sublime Plato, who would have been greater than 
Aristotle, had he condescended to descend to facts rather than to soar 
aloft, even unto the Divinity, on the wings of sublime theories.  St. 
Thomas is as sublime as Plato, and more reliable than Aristotle, 
because Aristotle backed the light of Christian faith, which alone can 
safely guide the human mind through the intricacies and obscurities of 
philosophy.  St. Thomas then, is the Christian Aristotle, the greatest 
of all philosophers, and the Prince of Theologians.  The importance and 
value of his Summa, which I have very imperfectly described, pointing 
out in a general way a few of its excellencies, were recognized and 
admitted as soon as it became known, and shortly after his death the 
Summa supplanted the Book of Sentences of Peter Lombard which for years 
had been the favorite text-book in the theological schools of the 
Middle Ages.<p> 

<A NAME="Popes"><b>Popes, Universities and Religious Orders.</b></a> -- 
Roman Pontiffs, the universities and religious Orders vied with one 
another in sounding the praises of the Angelic Doctor.  The 
universities and many religious orders bound themselves to follow his 
doctrine of which Pope Innocent VI said:  "Those who followed it never 
deviated from the path of truth; those who attacked it were always 
suspected of error."  Heretics (Beza, Bucer) unwillingly proclaimed his 
greatness by boasting that if his works were removed they could destroy 
the Catholic Church.  "The hope indeed was vain, but the testimony has 
its value," writes Leo. XIII (AEt. Patris).<p> 

COUNCILS:  <A NAME="Counc"><b>Council of Trent.</b></a> -- The 
greatest praise that can be bestowed upon St. Thomas is to be found in 
the history of the General Councils of the Church.  "In the Councils of 
Lyons, Vienne, Florence, and in the Vatican Council," writes Leo XIII, 
"you might say that St. Thomas was present in the deliberations and 
decrees of the Fathers and, as it were, presided over them, contending 
against the errors of the Greeks, the heretics, the rationalists, with 
overpowering force and the happiest results.  And it was an honor 
reserved to St. Thomas alone, and shared by none of the other Doctors 
of the Church, that the Fathers of Trent in their hall of assembly 
decided to place on the altar side by side with the Holy Scriptures and 
the Decrees of the Roman Pontiffs the Summa of St. Thomas, to seek in 
it counsel, arguments and decisions for their purpose" (<i>ib</i>).<p> 

<A NAME="Vatic"><b>Vatican Council.</b></a> -- I have heard it related, 
on very good authority, that at the Vatican Council the Bishop who was 
considered one of the best theologians among the assembled Fathers was 
Mgr. Gill, Archbishop of Saragossa, afterwards Cardinal.  Pius IX spoke 
of him as "the oracle of the council," and always asked him to give an 
opinion before the decrees were put to a final vote.  The Archbishop 
afterwards, replying to the congratulations of his brethren in 
religion, humbly protested that if he had said anything of value during 
the sessions of the Council, all the glory should be attributed to St. 
Thomas "because," he said, "whatever I may know about theology I 
learned from my two favorite books, the Summa of St. Thomas and the 
treatise 'De Locis Theologicis' of Melchoir Canus [a disciple of St. 
Thomas]."<p> 

Nothing more than this simple fact is required to prove the wisdom of 
Pope Leo XIII in calling upon his children throughout the world to 
study the works and the method of St. Thomas.  The reasons for this 
action of the Supreme Pontiff are set forth at length in the Encyclical 
"AEterni Patris."  Permit me to remark that, even from what has been 
said in these imperfect sketches of St. Thomas' influence on religious 
thought, it is evident that in his works are to be found the principles 
which would destroy the principal intellectual evils of our times, 
Rationalism, Indifferentism, and the foolish belief that there is a 
conflict between faith and science.  St. Thomas' career and every page 
of his writings are a contradiction and a standing refutation of those 
errors.  His works, indeed, should not be studied now as they would 
have been used in the thirteenth century; they should be adapted to the 
needs of the twentieth century.  His principles and his methods are 
suited to all times because, as Father Lacordaire remarks, granting 
that he has not foreseen and refuted all errors, he has said all that 
was necessary to refute them.<A HREF="staampfn.htm#n72">[72]</a><p> 

<A NAME="Shoul"><b>Should the Summa be Considered a Miracle.</b></a> -- 
If you ask How did it happen that this man, living six hundred years 
ago wrote a theology suited to the needs of all times?  I answer in the 
words of Pope John XXII:  Doctrina ejus non potroit esse sine miraculo 
(His learning cannot be explained without admitting a miracle)."<p>
