<h1>Chapter VIII: Of The Natural Law of Conscience.</h1>

<hr><p><h2>Section I. -- <i>Of the Origin of Primary Moral Judgments.</i></h2>

1. IT is an axiom of the schools, that whatever is
received, is received according to the manner of
the recipient.  We have spoken of the law that
governs the world, as that law has existed from
eternity in the mind of God. We have now to consider 
that law as it is received in creatures, and
becomes the inward determinant of their action.  
Action is either necessary or free. The great multitude 
of creatures are wholly necessary agents. Even
in free agents, most of what is in them, and much
that proceeds from them, is of necessity, and beyond
the control of their will. Of necessary action,
whether material or mental, we shall have nothing
further to say.  It is governed by the Eternal Law,
but it is not matter of moral philosophy.  Henceforth 
we have to do with that law, only as it is
received in free agents, as such, to be the rule of
their conduct.  The agents being free, the law must
be received in a manner consonant with their freedom. 
It is proper to a free and rational being to
guide itself, not to be dragged or pushed, but to
go its own way, yet not arbitrarily, but according
to law. The law for such a creature must be, not
a physical determinant of its action, but a law
operating in the manner of a motive to the will,
obliging and binding, yet not constraining it: a law
written in the intellect after the manner of knowledge: 
a law within the mind and consciousness of
the creature, whereby it shall measure and regulate
its own behaviour. This is the <i>natural law of 
conscience</i>. It is the Eternal Law, as made known to
the rational creature, whereby to measure its own
free acts.  The Eternal Law is in the Mind of God:
the Natural Law in the minds of men and angels.  
The Eternal Law adjusts all the operations of
creatures: the Natural Law, only the free acts of
intellectual creatures.  And yet, for binding force,
the Natural Law is one with the Eternal Law.  On
a summer evening one observes the sunset on the
west coast; the heavens are all aglow with the sun
shining there, and the waters are aglow too, reflect.
ing the sun's rays.  The Eternal Law is as the sun
there in the heavens, the Natural Law is like the
reflection in the sea. But it is one light.<p>

2. It is called the <i>Natural Law</i>, first, because it
is found, more or less perfectly expressed, in all
rational beings: now whatever is found in all the
individuals of a kind, is taken to belong to the specific
nature, or type of that kind. Again it is called the
<i>Natural Law</i>, because it is a thing which any rational
nature must necessarily compass and contain within
itself in order to arrive at its own proper perfection
and maturity. Thus this inner law is natural, in
the sense in which walking, speech, civilization are
natural to man. A man who has it not, is below the
standard of his species. It will be seen that dancing,
singing -- at least to a pitch of professional excellence -- 
and a knowledge of Greek, are not, in this sense,
<i>natural</i>. The Natural Law is not <i>natural</i>, in the
sense of "coming natural," as provincial people say,
or coming to be in man quite irrespectively of training and 
education, as comes the power of breathing.  
It was absurd of Paley (<i>Mor. Phil.</i>, bk. i., c.v.) to look
to the wild boy of Hanover, who had grown up in
the woods by himself, to display in his person either
the Natural Law or any other attribute proper to a
rational creature.<p>

3. We call this <i>the natural law of conscience</i>,
because every individual's conscience applies this
law, as he understands it, to his own particular
human acts, and judges of their morality accordingly.  
What then is conscience? It is not a faculty, not a
habit, it is an act. It is a practical judgment of the
understanding. It is virtually the conclusion of a
syllogism, the major premiss of which would be some
general principle of command or counsel in moral
matters; the minor, a statement of fact bringing
some particular case of your own conduct under
that law; and the conclusion, which is conscience,
a decision of the case for ourself according to that
principle: <i>e.g.</i>, 'There is no obligation of going to
church on (what Catholics call) a <i>day of devotion</i>:
this day I am now living is only a day of devotion;
therefore I am not bound to go to church to-day.'
Such is the train of thought, not always so explicitly
and formally developed, that passes through the
mind, when conscience works. It is important to
remember that conscience is an act of intellect, a
judgment, not on a matter of general principle, not
about other people's conduct, but about my own
action in some particular case, and the amount of
moral praise or blame that I deserve, or should
deserve, for it. As regards action already done,
or not done, conscience <i>testifies, accusing or excusing</i>.
As regards action contemplated, conscience <i>restrains</i>
or <i>prompts</i>, in the way of either obligation or counsel.<p>

4. Conscience is not infallible: it may err, like
any other human judgment. A man may be blind,
if not exactly to his own action, at least to the
motives and circumstances of his action.  He may
have got hold of a wrong general principle of conduct. 
He may be in error as to the application of
his principle to the actual facts. In all these ways,
what we may call the conscientious syllogism may be
at fault, like any other syllogism. It may be a bad
syllogism, either in logical form, or in the matter of
fact asserted in the premisses. This is an erroneous
conscience. But, for action contemplated, even an
erroneous conscience is an authoritative decision.
If it points to an obligation, however mistakenly,
we are bound either to act upon the judgment or get
it reversed. We must not contradict our own reason:
such contradiction is moral evil. (c. v., s. iii., n. 3, p. 74.)
If conscience by mistake sets us free of what is
objectively our bounden duty, we are not there and
then bound to that duty: but we may be bound at
once to get that verdict of conscience overhauled and
reconsidered. Conscience in this case has proceeded
in ignorance, which ignorance will be either vincible
or invincible, and must be treated according to the
rules provided in the matter of ignorance. (c. iii., s. i.,
nn. 3-5, p. 27.) An obligation, neglected in invincible 
ignorance, makes a merely <i>material sin</i>. (c. iii.,
s. ii., n. 7, p. 33.)<p>

5. There is another element of mind, often confounded 
under one name with conscience, but distinct
from it, as a habit from an act, and as principles
from their application. This element the schoolmen
called <i>synderesis</i>. [On the derivation of this 
word, whether from <b>suneid&ecirc;sis</b> or 
<b>sunt&ecirc;r&ecirc;sis</b> see <i>Athenaeum</i>, 
1877, vol. i., pp. 738, 798, vol, iii. pp. 16, 44.]<p>

<i>Synderesis</i> is an habitual hold upon primary moral
judgments, as, that we must do good, avoid evil,
requite benefactors, honour superiors, punish 
evildoers. There is a hot controversy as to how these
primary moral judgments arise in the mind. The
coals of dispute are kindled by the assumption, that
these moral judgments must needs have a totally
other origin and birth in the mind than speculative
first principles, as, that the whole is greater than the
part, that two and two are four, that things which
are equal to the same thing are equal to one another.
The assumption is specious, but unfounded. It looks
plausible because of this difference, that moral 
judgments have emotions to wait upon them, speculative
judgments have not. Speculative judgments pass
like the philosophers that write them down, unheeded
in the quiet of their studies. But moral judgments
are rulers of the commonwealth: they are risen to
as they go by, with majesty preceding and cares
coming after. Their presence awakens in us certain
emotions, conflicts of passion, as we think of the
good that we should do, but have not done, or of the
evil that goes unremedied and unatoned for. Commonly 
a man cannot contemplate his duty, a difficult
or an unfulfilled duty especially, without a certain
emotion, very otherwise than as he views the axioms
of mathematics.  There is a great difference emotionally, 
but intellectually the two sets of principles,
speculative and moral, are held alike as necessary
truths, truths that not only are, but must be, and
cannot be otherwise: truths in which the <i>predicate</i>
of the proposition that states them is contained
under the subject.  Such are called <i>self-evident 
propositions</i>; and the truths that they express, <i>necessary
truths</i>. The enquiry into the origin of our primary
moral judgments is thus merged in the question, how
we attain to necessary truth.<p>

6. The question belongs to Psychology, not to
Ethics: but we will treat it briefly for ethical purposes. 
And first for a clear notion of the kind of
judgments that we are investigating.<p>

"The primary precepts of the law of nature
stand to the practical reason as the first principles
of scientific demonstration do to the speculative
reason : for both sets of principles are self-evident.  
A thing is said to be self-evident in two ways, either
<i>in itself</i>, or <i>in reference to us</i>. In itself every 
proposition, the predicate of which can be got from consideration 
of the subject is said to be self-evident. But
it happens that to one who is ignorant of the definition 
of the subject, such a proposition will not be
self-evident: as this proposition, <i>Man is a rational
being</i>, is self-evident in its own nature, because to
name man is to name something rational; and yet,
to one ignorant what man is, this proposition is not
self-evident. And hence it is that, as Boethius
says: 'there are some axioms self-evident to all
alike.' Of this nature are all those propositions
whose terms are known to all, as, <i>Every whole is
greater than its part</i>; and, <i>Things which aye equal to
the same thing are equal to one another</i>.  Some propositions 
again are self-evident only to the wise, who
understand the meaning of the terms: as, to one
who understands that an angel is not a body, it is
self-evident that an angel is not in a place by way of
circumscription;* which is not manifest to others,
who do not understand the term." (St.  Thos., 1a 2ae
q. 94, art. 2, in corp.) [*<i>Circumspective</i>, which 
word is explained by St. Thos., 1a, q. 5a. art. 1.]<p>

One more extract. "From the very nature of
an intellectual soul it is proper to man that, as soon
as he knows what a whole is, and what a part is, he
knows that every whole is greater than its part; and
so of the rest. But what is a whole, and what a
part, that he cannot know except through sensory
impressions.  And therefore Aristotle shows that
the knowledge of principles comes to us through the
senses." (St.  Thos., 1a 2ae, q. 51, art. 1, in corp.)<p>

7. Thus the propositions that <i>right is to be done,
benefactors to be requited</i>, are self-evident, necessary
truths, to any child who has learned by experience
the meaning of <i>right</i>, of <i>kindness</i>, and of a 
<i>return of kindness</i>. 'Yes, but' -- some one will say -- 
'however does he get to know what <i>right</i> and <i>wrong</i> are?
Surely sensory experience cannot teach him that.'
We answer, man's thoughts begin in sense, and are
perfected by reflection.  Let us take the idea of
<i>wrong</i>, the key to all other elementary moral ideas.
The steps by which a child comes to the fulness of
the idea of <i>wrong</i> may be these. First, the thing is
<i>forbidden</i>: then one gets <i>punished</i> for it. Punishment
and prohibition enter in by eye and ear and other
senses besides. Then the thing is <i>offensive</i> to those
we love and revere. Then it is <i>bad for us</i>. Then it
is <i>shameful, [s]habby, unfair, unkind, selfish, hateful to God</i>.  
All these points of the idea of wrong are grasped by
the intellect, beginning with sensory presentations of
what is seen and felt and heard said. Again with
the idea of <i>ought</i>. This idea is sometimes said to
defy analysis. But we have gone about (c. vi.) to
analyse it into two elements, <i>nature requiring, nature's
King commanding</i>.  The idea of <i>wrong</i> we analysed
into a breach of this natural requirement, and this
Divine command or law. Primary moral ideas, then,
yield to intellectual analysis.  They are of this style:
<i>to be done, as I wish to be rational and please God: not
to be done, unless I wish to spoil myself and disobey
my Maker</i>. But primary moral ideas, compared
together, make primary moral judgments.  Primary
moral judgments, therefore, arise in the intellect,
by the same process as other beliefs arise there
in matters of necessary truth.<p>

8. Thus, applying the principle known as <i>Occham's
razor</i>, that "entities are not to be multiplied without
reason," we refuse to acknowledge any Moral Sense,
distinct from Intellect. We know of no peculiar
faculty, specially made to receive "ideas, pleasures
and pains in the moral order." (Mackintosh, <i>Ethics</i>,
p. 206.) Most of all, we emphatically protest against
any blind power being accredited as the organ of
morality. We cannot accept for our theory of
morals, that everything is right which warms the
breast with a glow of enthusiasm, and all those
actions wrong, at which emotional people are prone
to cry out, <i>dreadful, shocking</i>.  We cannot accept
emotions for arbitrators, where it most concerns
reasonable beings to have what the Apostle calls
enlightened eyes of the heart" (Ephes. i. 18), that
we may "know to refuse the evil and to choose
the good." (Isaias vii. 15.) A judge may have his
emotions, but his charge to the jury must be dictated,
not by his heart, but by his knowledge of the law.
And the voice of conscience, whatever feelings it may
stir, must be an intellectual utterance, and, to be
worth anything in a case of difficulty, a reasoned
conclusion, based on observation of facts, and application 
of principles, and consultation with moral
theologians and casuists. A subjective and emotional 
standard of right and wrong is as treacherous
and untrustworthy as the emotional justification of
those good people, who come of a sudden to "feel
converted."<p>

9. It would be unnecessary, except for the wrongheadedness 
of philosophers, to observe, that conscience 
requires educating.  As moral virtue is a
habit of appetite, rational or irrational, a formation
resulting from frequent acts; and as the child needs
to be aided and assisted from without towards the
performance of such acts, in order to overcome the
frequent resistance of appetite to reason (c. v., s. ii.,
n. 4, p. 71): so the springs of conscience are certain
intellectual habits, whereby the subject is cognisant
of the principles of natural law, and of their bearing 
on his own conduct, habits which, like the habits
of moral virtue, require to be formed by acts from
within and succour from without, since merely the
rudiments of the habit are supplied by nature.  Even
the first principles of morality want formulating and
pointing out to children, like the axioms of geometry.  
The mother tells her little one: 'Ernest, or Frank,
be a good boy:' while the schoolmaster explains to
Master Ernest that two straight lines cannot possibly
enclose a space.  There is something in the boy's
mind that goes along with and bears out both the
teaching of his master and his mother's exhortation:
something that says within him: 'To be sure, those
lines can't enclose a space:' 'Certainly, I ought
to be good.' It is not merely on authority that he
accepts these propositions. His own understanding 
welcomes and approves them: so much so, that
once he has understood them, he would not believe
the contrary for being told it.  You would not persuade 
a child that it was right to pull mother's
hair; or that half an orange was literally, as Hesiod
says, "more than the whole." He would answer
that it could not be, that he knew better.<p>

10.  On one ground there is greater need of education 
for the conscience than for any other intellectual
formation: that is because of the power of evil to
fascinate and blind on practical issues of duty.
Cicero well puts it:<p>

"We are amazed and perplexed by variety of
opinions and strife of authorities; and because there
is not the same divergence upon matters of sense,
we fancy that the senses afford natural certainty,
while, for moral matters, because some men take
one view, some another, and the same men different
views at different times, we consider that any settlement 
that can be arrived at is merely conventional,
which, is a huge mistake.  The fact is, there is no
parent, nor nurse, nor schoolmaster, nor poet, nor
stage play, to corrupt the judgments of sense, nor
consent of the multitude to wrench them away from
the truth. It is for minds and consciences that
all the snares are set, as well by the agency of
those whom I have just mentioned, who take us in
our tender and inexperienced age, and ingrain and
fashion us as they will, as also by that counterfeit
presentment of good, which lurks in the folds of
every sense, the mother of all evil, pleasure, under
whose seductive blandishments men fail to recognise 
the moral good that nature offers, because it is
unaccompanied by this itching desire and satisfaction." 
(Cicero, <i>De Legibus</i>, i., 17.)<p>

Newman, <i>Grammar of Assent</i>, pp. 102-112.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- <i>Of the invariability of Primary Moral 
Judgments.</i></h2>

1. The following narrative is taken from Grote's 
History of Greece, c. 81.:<p>

"It was a proud day for the Carthaginian general 
[Hannibal, B.C. 409, therefore not the victor of Cannae.]
when he stood as master on the ground of
Himera; enabled to fulfil the duty, and satisfy the
exigencies, of revenge for his slain grandfather.  
Tragical indeed was the consummation of this
long-cherished purpose. . . . All the male captives,
3,000 in number, were conveyed to the precise spot
where Hamilkar had been slain, and there put to
death with indignity, as an expiatory satisfaction
to his lost honour. No man can read the account
of this wholesale massacre without horror and
repugnance. Yet we cannot doubt, that among all
the acts of Hannibal's life, this was the one in which
he most gloried; that it realized in the most complete 
and emphatic manner, his concurrent aspirations
of <i>filial sentiment, religious obligation, and honour as
a patriot</i> [Italics mine]; hat to show mercy would have been
regarded as a mean dereliction of these esteemed
impulses. . . . Doubtless, the feelings of Hannibal
were cordially shared, and the plenitude of his
revenge envied, by the army around him.  So
different, sometimes so totally contrary, is the tone
and direction of the moral sentiments, among different 
ages and nations."<p>

We may supplement this story by another from
Herodotus (iii., 38):<p>

Darius, after he had got the kingdom, called
into his presence certain Greeks who were at hand,
and asked, 'What he should pay them to eat the
bodies of their fathers when they died.' To which
they answered, that there was no sum that would
tempt them to do such a thing. He then sent for
certain Indians, of the race called Callatians, men,
who eat their fathers, and asked them, while the
Greeks were standing by, and knew by the aid of an
interpreter all that was said -- 'What he should give
them to burn the bodies of their fathers, at their
decease?' The Indians exclaimed aloud, and bade
him forbear such language. Such is the way of
men; and Pindar was right in my judgment, when
he said, 'Convention is king over all.'<p>

2. If any one held that the natural law of conscience 
was natural in the same way as the sense
of temperature: if one held to the existence of a
Moral Sense in all men, settling questions of right
and wrong, as surely as all men know sweet things
from bitter by tasting them: these stories, and
they could be multiplied by hundreds, abundantly
suffice to confute the error. There is no authentic
copy of the moral law, printed, framed, and hung
up by the hand of Nature, in the inner sanctuary of
every human heart. Man has to learn his duties
as he learns the principles of health, the laws of
mechanics, the construction and navigation of vessels,
the theorems of geometry, or any other art or science.
And he is just as likely to go wrong, and has gone
wrong as grievously, in his judgments on moral
matters as on any other subject of human knowledge. 
The knowledge of duties is <i>natural</i> (as
explained in the previous section, n. 2), not because
it comes spontaneously, but because it is necessary
to our nature for the development and perfection of
the same. Thus a man <i>ought</i>, so far as he can, to
learn his duties: but we cannot say of a man, as
such, that he ought to learn geometry or navigation.
If a man does not know his duties, he is excused
by ignorance, according to the rules under which
ignorance excuses. (c. iii., s. i., nn. 3-5, p. 27.) If
a man does not know navigation, there is no question of 
<i>excuse</i> for what he was not bound to learn,
but he may suffer <i>loss</i> by his want of knowledge.<p>

3. It was furthermore observed above (l.c.), that
the <i>natural</i> law was so called as being found expressed
more or less perfectly in the minds of all men, and
therefore being a proper element of human nature.
It remains to see how much this universal natural
expression amounts to. That is at once apparent
from our previous explanation of <i>synderesis</i>. (s.i., 
nn. 5, seq., p. 139.) Not a complete and accurate knowledge 
of the natural law is found in all minds, far
from it; but <i>synderesis</i> is found in all. This is
apparent from Mr. Grote's own phrases, "aspirations of filial 
sentiment," " religious obligation,"
honour as a patriot," <i>Parents are to be honoured,
we must do our duty to God and to our country</i>: there
Hannibal was at one with the most approved
teachers of morality. Callatian and Greek agreed
in the recognition of the commandment, <i>Honour thy
father and thy mother</i>. That was the major premiss of
them both, in the moral syllogism (s. i., n. 3, p. 135),
which ruled their respective consciences. Their
difference was upon the <i>applying minor</i>, as it is
called; the Greek regarding the dissolution of the
body into its elements by fire, and so saving it from
corruption, as the best means of honouring the dead:
the Callatians preferring to raise their parents as it
were to life again, by making them the food of their
living children. Hannibal, again, had before his
mind the grand principle of retribution, that wrongdoing 
must be expiated by suffering. But he
had not heard the words "Vengeance is Mine;"
and mistakenly supposed it to rest with himself to
appoint and carry out his own measure of revenge.
Whether he was quite so invincibly ignorant on this
point, as Grote represents, is open to doubt. At
any rate he was correct in the primary moral
judgment on which he proceeded.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section III. -- <i>Of the immutability of the Natural Law.</i></h2>

1. Besides printing, many methods are now in
vogue for multiplying copies of a document. Commonly
the document is written out with special ink
on special paper: the copy thus used is called a
stencil; and from it other copies are struck off. We
will suppose the stencil to be that page of the Eternal
Law written in the Mind of God, which regulates
<i>human acts</i>, technically so called.  The copies struck
off from that stencil will be the Natural Law in the
mind of this man and of that. Now, as all who are
familiar with copying processes know too well, it
happens at times that a copy comes out very faint,
and in parts not at all. These faint and partial
copies represent the Natural Law as it is imperfectly
developed in the minds of many men. In this sense,
and as we may say subjectively, the Natural Law is
mutable, very mutable indeed. Still, as no one would
say that the document had been altered, because
some copies of it were bad, so it is not strictly
correct to say that the Natural Law varies with these
subjective varieties. Appeal would be made to a full
and perfectly printed impression of the document,
one that rendered the stencil exactly. The Natural
Law must be viewed in like manner, as it would
exist in a mind perfectly enlightened concerning
the whole duty of man, and exactly reproducing 
itself that portion of the Eternal Law which
ordains such duty. Were such a mind to discern
a natural obligation to lie differently at two different
times, all the relevant circumstances being alike in
both cases, and the moral solution different, then
only could the Natural Law be held to have changed.<p>

2. But this is clearly impossible. The conclusion
of a geometrical theorem is a truth for all time.
There is no difference here between a complicated
theorem, having many conditions, and a simpler
theorem with fewer. It is indeed easier for a few
than for many conditions to be all present together:
but the enunciation of the conclusion supposes all
the conditions, whatever their number. The same
in a practical manner, as in the stability of a bridge.
The bridge that would stand in England, would
stand in Ceylon. If it would not, there must have
occurred some change in the conditions, as the heat
of the tropical sun upon the girders. A point of
casuistry also, however knotty, once determined, is
determined for ever and aye, for the circumstances
under which it was determined.  The Natural Law
in this sense is absolutely immutable, no less in
each particular application than in the most general
principles. We must uniformly pass the same
judgment on the same case. What is once right
and reasonable, is always right and reasonable, in
the same matter. Where today, there is only one
right course, there cannot to-morrow be two, unless
circumstances have altered. The Natural Law is
thus far immutable, every jot and tittle.

3. No power in heaven above nor on earth
beneath can dispense from any portion of the
Natural Law. For the matter of the negative
precepts of that law is, as we have seen, something 
bad in itself and repugnant to human nature,
and accordingly forbidden by God: while the matter
of the positive precepts is something good and
necessary to man, commanded by God.  If God
were to take off His command, or prohibition, the
intrinsic exigency, or intolerableness, of the thing
to man would still remain, being as inseparable
from humanity as certain mathematical properties
from a triangle. Pride is not made for man, nor
fornication, nor lying, nor polygamy: [There is a 
theological difficulty about the polygamy of the
patriarchs, which will be touched on in Natural Law, 
c. vi., s. ii., n. 4, p. 272.] human
nature would cry out against them, even were the
Almighty in a particular instance to withdraw His
prohibition. What would be the use, then, of any
such withdrawal? It would not make the evil thing
good. An evil thing it would still remain, unnatural,
irrational, and as such, displeasing to God, the
Supreme Reason. The man would not be free to
do the thing, even though God did not forbid it.  It
appears, therefore, that the Divine prohibition, and
similarly the Divine command, which we have proved
(c. vi., s. ii., nn. 10, 11, p. 121) to be necessarily 
imposed in matters of natural evil and of naturally
imperative good, is imposed as a hard and fast line,
so long as the intrinsic good or evil remains the same.<p>

4. There is, therefore, no room for Evolution in
Ethics and Natural Law any more than in Geometry.
One variety of geometrical construction, or of moral
action, may succeed another; but the truths of the
science, by which those varieties are judged, change
not. There is indeed this peculiarity about morality,
distinguishing it from art, that if a man errs 
invincibly, the evil that he takes for good is not
<i>formally</i> evil, or evil as he wills it, and the good that
he takes for evil is<i>formally</i> evil to him. (c. iii., s. ii.),
n. 7, p. 33.) So there is variation and possible Evolution 
in bare formal good and bare <i>formal</i> evil, as,
ignorance gradually changes into knowledge; and
likewise Reversion, as knowledge declines into
ignorance. Even this Evolution and Reversion have
their limits: they cannot occur in the primary 
principles of morality, as we saw in the last section. But
morality <i>material</i> and objective, -- complete morality
where the formal and material elements agree, where
real wrong is seen to be wrong, and real right is
known for right-in this morality there is no Evolution. 
If Hannibal offered human sacrifices to his
grandfather because he knew no better, and could
not have known better, than to think himself
bound so to do, he is to be excused, and even
praised for his piety: still it was a mistaken piety;
and the act, apart from the light in which the doer
viewed it, was a hideous crime.  An incorrupt teacher
of morals would have taught the Carthaginian, not
that he was doing something perfectly right for his
age and country, which, however, would be wrong
in Germany some centuries later, but that he was
doing an act there and then evil and forbidden of
God, from which he was bound, upon admonition,
instantly to desist. [The author has seen reason 
somewhat to modify this view, as appears by the Appendix. 
(Note to Third Edition.)]<p>

5. There are Evolution and Reversion in architecture, 
but not in the laws of stability of structure,
nor in the principles of beauty as realized in building. 
A combination, ugly now, was not beautiful in
the days of Darius. Tastes differ, but not right
tastes; and moral notions, but not right moral
notions. It is true that questions of right and
wrong occur in one state of society, that had no
relevance in an earlier state, the conditions of the
case not having arisen. But so it is in architecture; 
there are no arches in the Parthenon.

The principle of the arch, however, held in the
age of Pericles, though not applied.<p>

6. The progress of Moral Science is the more
and more perfect development of the Natural Law
in the heart of man, a psychological, not an 
ontological development. And Moral Science does
progress. No man can be a diligent student of
morality for years, without coming to the understanding 
of many things, for which one would look
in vain in Aristotle's <i>Ethics</i> and <i>Politics</i>, or in Cicero,
<i>De Officiis</i>, or even in the <i>Summa</i> of St. Thomas,
or perhaps in any book ever written. New moral
questions come for discussion as civilization 
advances. The commercial system of modern times
would furnish a theme for another De Lugo. And
still on this path of ethical discovery, to quote the
text that Bacon loved, " Many shall pass over, and
knowledge shall be multiplied." (Daniel xii. 4.)<p>

1.  Sometimes conscience returns a clear, positive
answer as to the morality of an act contemplated.
True or false the answer may be, but the ring of it
has no uncertain sound. At other times conscience
is perplexed, and her answer is, <i>perhaps</i>, and <i>perhaps
not</i>.  When the woman hid Achimaas and Jonathan
in the well, and said to Absalom's servants, "They
passed on in haste" (2 Kings xvii. 17-21), did she
do right in speaking thus to save their lives? A
point that has perplexed consciences for centuries.
A man's hesitation is sometimes subjective and
peculiar to himself. It turns on a matter of fact,
which others know full well, though he doubts; or
on a point of law, dark to him, but clearly ruled by
the consent of the learned. In such cases it is his
duty to seek information from people about him,
taking so much trouble to procure it as the importance 
of the matter warrants, not consulting ten
doctors as to the ownership of one hen. But it
may be that all due enquiries fail. The fact remains
obscure; or about the law, doctors differ, and arguments 
conflict indecisively. What is the man to do?
Take the <i>safe</i> course: suppose there is an obligation,
and act accordingly? This principle, put as a command, 
would make human life intolerable. It is,
moreover, false, when so put, as we shall presently
prove.  Take the easy course, and leave the obligation 
out of count? This principle is more nearly
correct than the other: but it needs interpretation,
else it may prove dangerously lax.<p>

2. To return to Achimaas and Jonathan and
their hostess.  Some such reckoning as this may
have passed through her mind: 'Lying lips are
an abomination to the Lord: but is it a lie to put
murderers off the scent of blood?' To that question 
finding no answer, she may have made up her
mind in this way: 'Well, I don't know, but I'll
risk it.' If that were her procedure, she did not
walk by the scientific lines of Probabilism. The
probabilist runs no risk, enters upon no uncertainty,
and yet he by no means always follows what is
technically termed the <i>safe</i> course, that is, the
course which supposes the obligation, e.g., in the
case in point, to have said simply where the men
were. How then does the probabilist contrive to
extract certainty out of a case of insoluble doubt?
By aid of what is called a <i>reflex</i> principle. A <i>reflex</i>
is opposed to a <i>direct</i> principle.  A direct principle
lays down an obligation, as it would bind one who
had a perfect discernment of the law and of the
facts of the case, and of the application of the one
to the other, and who was perfectly able to keep the
law.  By a <i>reflex</i> principle, a man judges of his own
act, taking account of the imperfection of his knowledge 
and the limitations of his power. Probabilism
steps in, only where a case is practically insoluble to
an agent upon direct principles. The probabilist
thereupon leaves the direct speculative doubt 
unsolved. He relinquishes the attempt of determining
what a man should do in the case in question, who
had a thorough insight into the lie of the law. He
leaves that aside, and considers what is his duty,
or not his duty, in the deficiency of his knowledge.
Then he strikes upon the principle, which is the root
of Probabilism, that <i>a doubtful law has no binding
power</i>. It will be observed that this is a <i>reflex</i>
principle. For objectively nothing is doubtful, but
everything is or is not in point of fact. To a mind
that had a full grasp of the objective order of things,
there would be no doubtful law: such a mind would
discern the law in every case as holding or not holding. 
But no human mind is so perfect. Every man
has to take account of his own limitations of vision
in judging of his duty. The question for me is, not
the law absolutely, but the law as far as I can make
it out. Our proposition, then, states that when an
individual, using such moral diligence of enquiry as
the gravity of the matter calls for, still remains in a
state of honest doubt as to whether the law binds,
in that mental condition it does not bind him.<p>

3. What the law does not forbid, it leaves open.  
Aristotle indeed (<i>Eth.</i>, V., xi., 1) says the contrary,
that what the law does not command (he instances
suicide), it forbids. All that he seems to mean is,
that if there be an act which at times might appear
advantageous, and yet is never commanded, there
is a presumption of the legislator being averse to
that act. Again, there are special occasions, in view
of which the legislator undertakes to regulate the
whole outward conduct of a man by positive
enactment, as with a soldier on parade: what is
not there commanded, is forbidden. But these
instances do not derogate from our general proposition, 
which is proved in this way. The office of
law is not to loose, but to bind. It declares, not
what the subject may do, but what he must or must
not. It does not bring liberty, but restriction.  
Therefore, if any one wishes to assert a restriction,
he must go to a law to prove it. If he can find
none, liberty remains. The law is laid on liberty.
Liberty is pot the outcome of law, but prior to it.
Liberty is in possession. The burden of proof rests
with those who would abridge liberty and impose an
obligation. It is an axiom of law itself, a natural,
not an arbitrary axiom, that <i>better is the condition of
the possessor</i>: which amounts in this matter to
another statement, also axiomatic, that <i>a law binds
not till it is promulgated</i>. But a law of which I have
serious outstanding doubts whether it exists at
all, or, if existent, whether it reaches my case,
is for this occasion a law not duly promulgated
to me. Therefore it binds me not, and my liberty
remains.<p>

4. It remains to consider what constitutes a
<i>serious outstanding doubt</i>. The word <i>outstanding</i> has
been already explained. It means that we have
sought for certain information, and cannot procure
it. Now what is a <i>serious</i> doubt? It is a doubt
founded on a <i>positive</i> opinion against the existence
of the law, or its applicability to the case in point,
an opinion fraught with probability, <i>solid, comparative,
practical probability</i>. The doubt must not be mere
negative doubt, or ignorance that cannot tell why
it doubts; not a vague suspicion, or sentimental
impression that defies all intellectual analysis; not
a mere subjective inability to make up one's mind,
but some counter-reason that admits of positive
statement, as we say, <i>in black and white</i>. It is true
that many minds cannot define their grounds of
doubt, even when these are real. Such minds are
unfit to apply the doctrine of Probabilism to 
themselves, but must seek its application from others.
The opinion against the law, when explicitly drawn
out, must be found to possess a solid probability.
It may be either an intrinsic argument from reason
and the nature of the case, or an extrinsic argument
from the word of some authority: but the reason or
the authority must be grave. The opinion is thus
said to be <i>intrinsically</i> or <i>extrinsically</i> probable. The
probability must also be <i>comparative</i>. There is many
an argument, in itself a very good one, that perishes
when we come to consider the crushing weight of
evidence on the other side. An opinion is <i>comparatively 
probable</i>, when after hearing all the reasons
and all the authorities on the other side, the said
opinion still remains <i>not unlikely</i>, which is all that
we mean to say of an opinion here, when we call it
<i>probable</i>. In ordinary English, the word <i>probable</i>
means <i>more likely than otherwise</i>, which is not the
signification of the Latin <i>opinio probabilis</i>.  Lastly,
the probability must be <i>practical</i>: it must take
account of all the circumstances of the case.
Practical probability is opposed to <i>speculative</i>, which
leaves out of count certain circumstances, which are
pretty sure to be present, and to make all the
difference in the issue. Thus it is speculatively
probable that a Catholic might without sin remain
years without confession, never having any grievous
sins to confess, grievous sin alone being necessary
matter for that sacrament. There is no downright
cogent reason why a man might not do so. And
yet, if he neglected such ordinary means of grace as
confession of venial sin, having it within reach,
month after month, no one, considering "the sin
which surrounds us," would expect that man to go
without grievous scathe. In mechanics, there are
many machines that work prettily enough in 
speculation and on paper, where the inventors do not
consider the difficulties of imperfect material, careless
handling, climate, and other influences, that render
the invention of no practical avail.<p>

5. The safest use of probabilism is in the field
of property transactions and of positive law. There
is greatest risk of using it amiss in remaining in a
false religion. All turns upon the varying amount
of trouble involved in <i>moral diligence</i> of enquiry,
according as the matter at issue is a point of mere
observance or of vital interest.<p>

6. The point on which the probability turns
must be the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the action,
not any other issue, as that of the physical consequences. 
Before rolling boulder-stones down a hill
to amuse in self, it is not enough to have formed
a probable opinion that there is no one coming up.
That would be probabilism misapplied. The correct
enquiry is: Does any intrinsic reason or extrinsic
authority make the opinion probable, that it is
lawful for mere amusement to roll down rocks with
any belief short of certainty that no one will be
crushed thereby? The probability, thus turned on
to the lawfulness of the action, breaks down altogether. 
This explanation, borne in mind, will save
much misapprehension.
