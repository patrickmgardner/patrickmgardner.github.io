<h1>Chapter V: Of Habits and Virtues.</h1>

<hr><p><h2>Section I. -- <i>Of Habit</i>.</h2>

1. <i>A habit is a quality difficult to change, whereby
an agent whose nature it was to work one way or another
indeterminately, is disclosed easily and readily at will to
follow this or that particular line of action</i>. Habit
differs from <i>disposition</i>, as disposition is a quality
easily changed. Thus one in a good humour is in
a disposition to be kind. Habit is a part of character:
disposition is a passing fit. Again, habit differs
from <i>faculty</i>, or power: as power enables one to act;
but habit, presupposing power, renders action easy
and expeditious, and reliable to come at call. We
have a power to move our limbs, but a habit to
walk or ride or swim. Habit then is the determinant 
of power. One and the same power works
well or ill, but not one and the same habit.<p>

2. A power that has only one way of working,
set and fixed, is not susceptible of habit. Such
powers are the forces of inanimate nature, as 
gravitation and electricity. A thing does not gravitate
better for gravitating often. The moon does not
obey the earth more readily to-day than she did in
the days of Ptolemy, or of the Chaldean sages.
Some specious claim to habit might be set up on
behalf of electricity and magnetism. A glass rod
rubbed at frequent intervals for six months, is a
different instrument from what it would have been,
if left all that time idle in a drawer. Then there
are such cases as the gradual magnetising of an iron
bar. Still we cannot speak of electrical habits, or
magnetic habits, not at least in things without life,
because there is no will there to control the exercise
of the quality.  As well might we speak of a 
"tumble-down" habit in a row of houses, brought on by
locomotives running underneath their foundations.
It is but a case of an accumulation of small effects,
inducing gradually a new molecular arrangement,
so that the old powers act under new material
conditions. But habit is a thing of life, an appurtenance 
of will, not of course independent of material
conditions and structural alterations, in so far forth
as a living and volitional is also a material agent,
but essentially usable <i>at will</i>, and brought into play
and controlled in its operation by free choice.
Therefore a habit that works almost automatically
has less of the character of a true habit, and passes
rather out of morality into the region of physics.
Again, bad habits, vices to which a man is become
a slave against his better judgment, are less properly
called habits than virtues are; for such evil habits
do not so much attend on volition (albeit volition
has created them) as drag the will in their wake.
For the like reason, habit is less properly predicable
of brute animals than of men: for brutes have no
intelligent will to govern their habits. The highest
brutes are most susceptible of habit. They are
most like men in being most educable. And, of
human progeny, some take up habits, in the best
and completest sense of the term, more readily than
others. They are better subjects for education:
education being nothing else than the formation of
habits.<p>

3. Knowledge consists of intellectual habits.
But the habits of most consequence to the moralist
lie in the will, and in the sensitive appetite as
amenable to the control of the will. In this
category come the virtues, in the ordinary sense
Of that name, and secondarily the vices.<p>

4. A habit is acquired by acts. Whereupon this
difficulty has been started: -- If the habit, say of
mental application, comes from acts of study, and
again the acts from the habit, how ever is the habit
originally acquired? We answer that there are two
ways in which one thing may come from another.  
It may come in point of its very existence, as child
from parent; or in point of some mode of existence,
as scholar from master. A habit has its very
existence from acts preceding: but those acts have
their existence independent of the habit. The acts
which are elicited after the habit is formed, owe to
the habit, not their existence, but the mode of their
existence: that is to say, because of the habit the
acts are now formed readily, reliably, and artistically, 
or virtuously.  The primitive acts which
gradually engendered the habit, were done with
difficulty, fitfully, and with many failures, -- more by
good luck than good management, if it was a matter
of skill, and by a special effort rather than as a thing
of course, where it was question of moral well-doing.
(See c. ii., s. ii., n. 9, p. 10.)<p>

5. A habit is a living thing: it grows and must
be fed. It grows on acts, and acts are the food
that sustain it. Unexercised, a habit pines away:
corruption sets in and disintegration. A man, we
will say, has a habit of thinking of God during his
work. He gives over doing so. That means that he
either takes to thinking of everything and nothing,
or he takes up some definite line of thought to the
exclusion of God. Either way there is a new
formation to the gradual ruin of the old habit.<p>

6. <i>Habit</i> and <i>custom</i> may be distinguished in
philosophical language. We may say that custom
makes the habit. Custom does not imply any skill
or special facility.  A habit is a channel whereby
the energies flow, as otherwise they would not have
flowed, freely and readily in some particular direction.
A habit, then, is a determination of a faculty for
good or for evil. It is something intrinsic in a
man, a real modification of his being, abiding in
him in the intervals between one occasion for its
exercise and another: whereas custom is a mere
denomination, expressive of frequent action and no
more. Thus it would be more philosophical to
speak of a custom of early rising, and of a custom
of smoking, rather than of a habit of smoking,
except so far as, by the use of the word habit, you
may wish to point to a certain acquired skill of
the respiratory and facial muscles, and a certain
acquired temper of the stomach, enabling one to
inhale tobacco fumes with iidpunity.<p>

7.     Habits are acquired, but it is obvious that the
rate of acquisition varies in different persons.  This
comes from one person being more predisposed by
<i>nature</i> than another to the acquiring of this or that
habit. By nature, that is by the native temper and
conformation of his body wherewith he was born,
this child is more prone to literary learning, that to
mechanics, this one to obstinacy and contentiousness, 
that to sensuality, and so of the rest.  For
though it is by the soul that a man learns, and by
the act of his will and spiritual powers he becomes
a glutton or a zealot, nevertheless the bodily organs
concur and act jointly towards these ends.  The
native dispositions of the child's body for the
acquisition of habits depend to an unascertained
extent upon the habits of his ancestors. This is
the fact of <i>heredity</i>.<p>

8. Man is said to be "a creature of habits."
The formation of habits in the will saves the
necessity of continually making up the mind anew.  
A man will act as he has become habituated, except
under some special motive from without, or some
special effort from within. In the case of evil habits,
that effort is attended with immense difficulty. The
habit is indeed the man's own creation, the outcome
of his free acts.  But he is become the bondslave of
his creature, so much so that when the occasion
arrives, three-fourths of the act is already done, by
the force of the habit alone, before his will is
awakened, or drowsily moves in its sleep.  The
only way for the will to free itself here is not to wait
for the occasion to come, but be astir betimes, keep
the occasion at arm's length, and register many a
determination and firm protest and fervent prayer
against the habit. He who neglects to do this in
the interval has himself to blame for being overcome
every time that he falls upon the occasion which
brings into play the evil habit.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- <i>Of Virtues in General</i>.</h2>

1. Virtue in its most transcendental sense means
the excellence of a thing according to its kind.
Thus it is the virtue of the eye to see, and of a
horse to be fleet of foot.  Vice is a <i>flaw</i> in the make
of a thing, going to render it useless for the purpose
to which it was ordained. From the ethical standpoint, 
virtue is a habit that a man has got of doing
moral good, or doing that which it befits his rational
nature to do: and vice is a habit of doing moral
evil. (See c. i., n. 5.) It is important to observe that
virtue and vice are not acts but habits. Vices do
not make a man guilty, nor do virtues make him
innocent. A man is guilty or innocent according to
his acts, not according to his habits. A man may
do a wicked thing and not be vicious, or a good
action and not be virtuous. But no man is vicious
who has not done one, two, aye, many wicked
things: and to be virtuous, a man must have
performed many acts of virtue. Children do right
and wrong, but they have neither virtues nor vices
except in a nascent state: there has not yet been
time in them for the habits to be formed. When
sin is taken away by God and pardoned, the vice,
that is, the evil habit, if any such existed before, still
remains, and constitutes a danger for the future.
The habit can only be overcome by watchfulness
and a long continuance of contrary acts. But vice
is not sin, nor is sin vice, nor a good deed a virtue.<p>

2. The name of virtue is given to certain habits
residing in the intellect, as <i>intuition</i> or <i>insight</i> (into
self-evident truths), <i>wisdom</i> (regarding conclusions
of main application), <i>science</i> (of conclusions in special
departments), and <i>art</i>.  These are called <i>intellectual
virtues</i>.<p>

It was a peculiarity of Socrates' teaching, largely
shared by Plato, to make all virtue intellectual, a
doctrine expressed in the formula, <i>Virtue is knowledge</i>; 
which is tantamount to this other, <i>Vice is
ignorance, or an erroneous view</i>.  From whence the
conclusion is inevitable: <i>No evil deed is wilfully done</i>;
and therefore, <i>No man is to blame for being wicked</i>.<p>

3.  Undoubtedly there is a certain element of
ignorance in all vice, and a certain absence of
will about every vicious act.  There is likewise an
intellectual side to all virtue. These positions we
willingly concede to the Socratics. Every morally
evil act is borne of some voluntary inconsiderateness.
The agent is looking the wrong way in the instant
at which he does wrong. Either he is regarding
only the solicitations of his inferior nature to the
neglect of the superior, or he is considering some
rational good indeed, but a rational good which, if
he would look steadily upon it, he would perceive
to be unbefitting for him to choose. No man can
do evil in the very instant in which his understanding 
is considering, above all things else, that
which it behoves him specially to consider in the
case. Again, in every wrong act, it is not the sheer
evil that is willed, but the good through or with the
evil. Good, real or supposed, is sought for: evil is
accepted as leading to good in the way of means, or
annexed thereto as a circumstance. Moreover, no
act is virtuous that is elicited quite mechanically, or
at the blind instance of passion. To be virtuous,
the thing must be done <i>on principle</i>, that is, at the
dictate of reason and by the light of intellect.<p>

4. Still, virtue is not knowledge. There are
other than intellectual habits needed to complete
the character of a virtuous man. "I see the better
course and approve it, and follow the worse," said
the Roman poet.* " 
[<i>Video meliora proboque, / Deteriora sequor.</i>
(Ovid, <i>Metamorph.</i>, vii., 21)]
"The evil which I will not, that
I do," said the Apostle. It is not enough to have
an intellectual discernment of and preference for
what is right: but the will must be habituated to
embrace it, and the passions too must be habituated
to submit and square themselves to right being done.
In other words, a virtuous man is made up by the
anion of enlightened intellect with the moral virtues.  
The addition is necessary for several reasons.<p>

(a)     Ordinarily, the intellect does not necessitate
the will.  The will, then, needs to be clamped and
set by habit to choose the right thing as the intellect
proposes it.<p>

(b.) Intellect, or Reason, is not absolute in the
human constitution. As Aristotle (<i>Pol.</i>, I., v., 6)
says:" The soul rules the body with a despotic
command: but reason rules appetite with a commmand 
constitutional and kingly": that is to say, as
Aristotle elsewhere (<i>Eth.</i>, I., xiii., 15, 16) explains,
passion often "fights and resists reason, opposes
and contradicts": it has therefore to be bound by
ordinances and institutions to follow reason's lead:
these institutions are good habits, moral virtues,
resident there where passion itself is resident, in the
inferior appetite. It is not enough that the rider is
competent, but the horse too must be broken in.<p>

(c.) It is a saying, that "no mortal is always
wise." There are times when reason's utterance is
faint from weariness and vexation.  Then, unless
a man has acquired an almost mechanical habit
of obeying reason in the conduct of his will and
passions, he will in such a conjuncture act 
inconsiderately and do wrong. That habit is moral
virtue. Moral virtue is as the fly-wheel of an
engine, a reservoir of force to carry the machine
past the "dead points" in its working. Or again,
moral virtue is as discipline to troops suddenly
attacked, or hard pressed in the fight.<p>

5. Therefore, besides the habits in the intellect
that bear the name of intellectual virtues, the virtuous
man must possess other habits, as well in the will,
that this power may readily embrace what the
understanding points out to be good, as in the
sensitive appetite in both its parts, concupiscible
and irascible, so far forth as appetite is amenable
to the control of the will, that it may be so controlled 
and promptly obey the better guidance.
These habits in the will and in the sensitive appetite
are called <i>moral virtues</i>, and to them the name of
virtue is usually confined.<p>

<i>Readings</i>. -- St. Thos., 1a 2ae, q. 71, art. 1, in corp.;
<i>ib.</i>, q. 58, art. 2; <i>ib.</i>, q. 58, art. 3, in corp., ad 3; 
<i>ib.</i>, q. 56, art. 4, in corp., ad 1-3.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section III -- <i>Of the Difference between Virtues Intellectual
and Moral.</i></h2>

1. St. Thomas* (1a 2ae, q. 56, art. 3, in corp.)
draws this difference, that an intellectual virtue
gives one a facility in doing a good act; but a
moral virtue not only gives facility, but makes one
put the facility in use. <p>

[By <i>doing good</i> St. Thomas means the determination of the
appetite, rational or sensitive, to good. He says that intellectual
virtue does not prompt this determination of the appetite.  Of
course it does not : it prompts only the act of the power wherein it
resides : now it resides in the intellect, not in the appetite; and it
prompts the act of the intellect, which however is not always
followed by an act of appetite in accordance with it.]<p>

Thus a habit of grammar,
he says, enables one readily to speak correctly, but
does not ensure that one always shall speak 
correctly, for a grammarian may make solecisms on
purpose: whereas a habit of justice not only makes
a man prompt and ready to do just deeds, but
makes him actually do them. Not that any habit
necessitates volition. Habits do not necessitate,
but they facilitate the act of the will. (s. i., nn. 1,
2, 8, pp. 64, 68.)<p>

2. Another distinction may be gathered from
St. Thomas (1a 2ae, q. 21, art. 2, ad 2), that the special
intellectual habit called art disposes a man to act
correctly towards some particular end, but a moral
habit towards the common end, scope and purpose
of all human life. Thus medical skill ministers to
the particular end of healing: while the moral habit
of temperance serves the general end, which is final
happiness and perfection. So to give a wrong
prescription through sheer antecedent ignorance, is
to fail as a doctor: but to get drunk wittingly and
knowingly is to fail as a man.<p>

3. The grand distinction between intellectual
and moral habits seems to be this, that moral habits
reside in powers which may act against the dictate
of the understanding, -- the error of Socrates, noticed
above (c. v., s. ii., n. 2, p. 70), lay in supposing that
they could not so act: whereas the power which is
the seat of the intellectual habits, the understanding,
cannot possibly act against itself. Habits dispose
the subject to elicit acts of the power wherein they
reside. Moral habits induce acts of will and sensitive 
appetite intellectual habits, acts of intellect.
Will and appetite may act against what the agent
knows to be best: but intellect cannot contradict
intellect. It cannot judge that to be true and
beautiful which it knows to be false and foul.
If a musician strikes discords on purpose, or a 
grammarian makes solecisms wilfully, he is not therein
contradicting the intellectual habit within him, for
it is the office of such a habit to aid the intellect to
judge correctly, and the intellect here does correctly
judge the effect produced. On the other hand, if
the musician or grammarian blunders, the intellect,
within him has not been contradicted, seeing that
he knew no better: the habit of grammar or music
has not been violated, but has failed to cover the
case. Therefore the intellectual habit is not a 
safeguard to keep a man from going against his 
intelligent self. No such safeguard is needed: the
thing is impossible, in the region of pure intellect.  
In a region where no temptation could enter, 
intellectual habits would suffice alone of themselves to
make a perfectly virtuous man. To avoid evil and
choose good, it would be enough to know the one
and the other. But in this world seductive reasonings 
sway the will, and fits of passion the sensitive
appetite, prompting the one and the other to rise up
and break away from what the intellect knows all
along to be the true good of man. Unless moral
virtue be there to hold these powers to their
allegiance, they will frequently disobey the 
understanding. Such disobedience is more irrational
than any mere intellectual error. In an error
purely intellectual, where the will has no part, the
objective truth indeed is missed, but the intelligence
that dwells within the man is not flouted and gainsayed. 
It takes two to make a contradiction as to
make a quarrel. But an intellectual error has only
one side. The intellect, utters some false pronouncement, 
and there is nothing within the man that says
otherwise. In the moral error there is a contradiction 
within, an intestine quarrel. The intellect
pronounces a thing not good, not to be taken, and
the sensitive appetite will throw a veil over the face
of intellect, and seize upon the thing. That amounts
to a contradiction of a man's own intelligent self.<p>

4. It appears that, absolutely speaking, intellectual 
virtue is the greater perfection of a man
indeed in the act of that virtue, as we have seen, his
crowning perfection and happiness lies. But moral
virtue is the greater safeguard. The breach of
moral virtue is the direr evil. Sin is worse than
ignorance, and more against reason, because it is
against the doer's own reason. Moral virtue then
is more necessary than intellectual in a world where
evil is rife, as it is a more vital thing to escape
grievous disease than to attain the highest development 
of strength and beauty.  And as disease spoils
strength and beauty, not indeed always taking them
away, but rendering them valueless, so evil moral
habits subvert intellectual virtue, and turn it aside
in a wrong direction. The vicious will keeps the
intellect from contemplating the objects which are
the best good of man: so the contemplation is
thrown away on inferior things, often on base
things, and an overgrowth of folly ensues on those
points whereupon it most imports a man to be
wise.<p>

To sum up all in a sentence, not exclusive but
dealing with characteristics: <i>the moral virtues are the
virtues for this world, intellectual virtue is the virtue of
the life to come</i>.<p>

<i>Readings</i>. -- St. Thos., 1a 2ae, q. 58, art. 2, in
corp.; Ar., <i>Eth.</i>, I., xiii., 15-19 ; St. Thos., 1a 2ae,
q. 66, art. 3.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section IV. -- <i>Of the Mean in Moral Virtue</i>.</h2>

1. Moral virtue is a habit of doing the right thing
in the conduct of the will and the government of
the passions. Doing right is opposed to overdoing
the thing, and to underdoing it. Doing right is
taking what it suits a rational nature to desire, and
eschewing what is unsuitable under the circumstances. 
(c. i., n. 5.)<p>

But a thing may be unsuitable in two ways, by
excess, and by defect: the rational choice is in the
mean between these two. The moral order here is
illustrated from the physical. Too much exercise
and too little alike impair the strength; so of meat
and drink in regard to health; but diet and exercise
in moderation, and in proportion to the subject
create, increase, and preserve both health and
strength. So it is with temperance, and fortitude,
and all varieties of moral virtue. He who fights
shy of everything, and never stands his ground,
becomes a coward; while he who never fears at all,
but walks boldly up to all danger, turns out rash.
The enjoyer of every pleasure, who knows not what
it is to deny himself aught, is a libertine and loose
liver; while to throw over all the graces and delicious 
things of life, not as St. Paul did, who counted
all things dross, that he might gain Christ, but
absolutely, as though such things were of themselves
devoid of attraction, is boorishness and insensibility.
Thus the virtues of temperance and fortitude perish
in excess and defect, and live in the mean. It is to
be noticed in this illustration that the mean of
health is not necessarily the mean of virtue.
What is too little food, and too much exercise, for
the animal well-being of a man, may be the right
amount of both for him in some higher relation,
inasmuch as he is more than a mere animal; as for
a soldier in a hard campaign, where a sufficiency of
food and rest is incompatible with his serving his
country's need.<p>

2. The taking of means to an end implies the
taking them in moderation, not in excess, or we
shall overshoot the mark, nor again so feebly and
inadequately as to fall short, of it. No mere instrument 
admits of an unlimited use; but the end to be
gained fixes limits to the use of the instrument, thus
far, no more, and no less. Wherever then reason
requires an end to be gained, it requires a use of
means proportionate to the end, not coming short
of it, nor going so far beyond as to defeat the
purpose in view. The variety of good that is called
the Useful lies within definite limits, between two
wildernesses, so to speak, stretching out undefined
into the distance, wilderness of Excess on the one
side, and wilderness of Defect on the other.<p>

3. A true work of art cannot be added to or
taken from without spoiling it.  A perfect church
would be spoiled by a lengthening of the chancel or
raising the tower, albeit there are buildings, secular
and ecclesiastical, that might be drawn out two
miles long and not look any worse. The colouring
of a picture must not be too violent and positive;
but artistic colouring must be chaste, and artistic
utterance gentle, and artistic action calm and indicative 
of self-command. Not that voice and action
should not be impassioned for a great emergency,
but the very passion should bear the mark of 
control: in the great master's phrase, you must not
"tear a passion to tatters." It is by moderation
sitting upon power that works of art truly masculine
and mighty are produced; and by this sign they are
marked off from the lower host of things, gorgeous
and redundant, and still more from the order of
the loose, the lawless, the exaggerated, the 
insolent, and the profane."<p>

4.  On these considerations Aristotle framed his
celebrated definition of moral virtue: <i>the habit of
fixing the choice in the golden mean in relation to ourselves, 
defined by reason, as a prudent man would define
it</i>. All virtue is a habit, as we have seen -- a <i>habit</i>
of doing that which is the proper act of the power
wherein the habit resides. One class of moral
virtues is resident in the will, the act of which power
is properly called <i>choice</i>. The rest of the moral
virtues reside in the sensitive appetite, which also
may be said to <i>choose</i> that object on which it fastens.  
Thus moral virtur is a habit of <i>fixing the choice</i>. The
golden mean between two extremes of excess and
defect respectively has been already explained, and
may be further shown by a review of the virtues.  
Besides fortitude and temperance, already described,
liberality is a mean between prodigality and stinginess; 
magnificence between vulgar display and pettiness: 
magnanimity between vainglory and pusillanimity; 
truthfulness between exaggeration and dissimulation; 
friendship between complaisance, or
flattery, and frowardness, -- and so of the rest. The
golden mean must be taken in relation to ourselves,
because in many matters of behaviour and the
management of the passions the right amount for
one person would be excessive for another, according
to varieties of age, sex, station, and disposition.
Thus anger that might become a layman might be
unbefitting in a churchman; and a man might be
thought loquacious if he talked as much as a 
discreet matron. [Ar., <i>Pol.</i>, III., iv., 17, 
says just the converse, which marks the
altered position of woman in modern society.]
The golden mean, then, must be
defined by reason according to the particular 
circumstances of each case. But as Reason herself is to
seek where she is not guided by Prudence, the mean
of virtue must be defined, not by the reason of the
buffoon Pantolabus, or of Nomentanus the spendthrift, 
but as a prudent man would define it, given an
insight into the case.<p>

5. The "golden mean," as Horace named it
(<i>Od.</i>, ii., 10), obtains principally, if not solely, in
living things, and in what appertains to living things,
and in objects of art. A lake, as such, has no natural
dimensions: it may be ten miles long, it may be a
hundred; but an elephant or an oak-tree cannot go
beyond a certain growth. There is a vast range
between the temperature of a blast-furnace and the
temperature of the ice-pack on the Polar Sea, but
very limited is the range possible in the blood of a
living man. Viewed artistically, a hill may be too
low, or a lake want width, for man's eye to rest
upon it with perfect satisfaction.  The golden mean,
then, is an artistic conception, and what I may call
an <i>anthropological</i> conception: it suits man, and is
required by man, though Nature may spurn and
over-ride it. The earthquake, the hurricane, and
the angry ocean are not in the golden mean, not at
least from a human point of view.  If man chooses
to personify and body forth the powers of nature,
he creates some monstrous uncouth figure, like the
Assyrian and Egyptian idols; but if man makes a
study of man, and brings genius and patient elaboration 
to bear on his work, there emerges the symmetry
and perfect proportion of the Greek statue. No,
people ever made so much of the beauty of the
human form as the ancient Greeks: they made it
the object of a passion that marked their religion,
their institutions, their literature, and their art.
Their virtues and their vices turned upon it. Hence
the golden mean is eminently a Greek conception,
a leading idea of the Hellenic race. The Greek
hated a thing overdone, a gaudy ornament, a proud
title, a fulsome compliment, a high-flown speech, a
wordy peroration. <i>Nothing too much</i> was the inscription 
over the lintel of the national sanctuary
at Delphi. It is the surpassing grace of Greek art
of the best period, that in it there shines out the
highest power, with <i>nothing too much</i> of straining after
effect.  The study of Greek literary models operates
as a corrective to redundancy, and to what 
ill-conditioned minds take to be fine writing. The
Greek artist knew just how far to go, and when to
stop. That point he called, in his own unsurpassed
tongue, the <b>kairos</b>. " The right measure (<b>kairos</b>) is
at the head of all," says Pindar. "Booby, not to
have understood by how much the half is more than
the whole," is the quaint cry of Hesiod.  AEschylus
puts these verses in the mouth of his <i>Furies</i>:

<ul><ul>
     The golden mean is God's delight:<br>
     Extremes are hateful in His sight.<br>
     Hold by the mean, and glorify<br>
     Nor anarchy nor slavery.
</ul></ul><p>

Characteristic of Socrates was his <i>irony</i>, or way
of understating himself, in protest against the extravagant
professions of the sophists.  In the reckoning
of the Pythagoreans, the Infinite, the Unlimited, or
Unchecked, was marked as evil, in opposition to
good, which was the Limited. From thence, Plato,
taking up his parable, writes: "The goddess of the
Limit, my fair Philebus, seeing insolence and all
manner of wickedness breaking loose from all limit
in point of gratification and gluttonous greed, 
established a law and order of limited being; and you
say this restraint was the death of pleasure; I say
it was the saving of it." Going upon the tradition
of his countrymen, upon their art and philosophy,
their poetry, eloquence, politics, and inmost sentiment, 
Aristotle formulated the law of moral virtue --
to hold by the <i>golden mean</i>, as discerned by the
prudent in view of the present circumstances, 
between the two extremes of excess and defect.<p>

6. There is only one object on which man may
throw himself without reserve, his last end, the
adequate object of his happiness, God. God is
approached by faith, hope, and charity; but it
belongs not to philosophy to speak of these 
supernatural virtues. There remains to the philosopher
the natural virtue of religion, which is a part of
justice. Religion has to do with the inward act of
veneration and with its outward expression. To
the latter the rule of the mean at once applies.
Moderation in religion is necessary, so far as 
externals are concerned.  Not that any outward
assiduity, pomp, splendour, or costliness, can be
too much in itself, or anything like enough, to
worship God with, but it may be too much for our
limited means, which in this world are drawn on by
other calls. But our inward veneration for God
and desire to do Him honour, can never be too
intense: " Blessing the Lord, exalt Him as much as
you can: for He is above all praise." 
[Ecclus. xliii. 33.]<p>

7. The rule of the mean, then, is a human rule,
for dealing with men, and with human goods 
considered as means.  It is a Greek rule: for the
Greeks were of all nations the fondest admirers of
man and the things of man.  But when we ascend
to God, we are out among the immensities and
eternities.  The vastness of creation, the infinity
of the Creator, -- there is no mode or measure there.
In those heights the Hebrew Psalmist loved to soar.
Christianity, with its central dogma of the Incarnation, 
is the meeting of Hebrew and Greek. That
mystery clothes the Lord God of hosts with the
measured beauty, grace, and truth, that man can
enter into. But enough of this. Enough to show
that the Aristotelian doctrine of the mean is a highly
suggestive and wide-reaching doctrine beyond the
sphere of Morals. It throws out one great branch
into Art, another into Theology.<p>

 8. The vicious extremes, on this side and on
that of a virtue, are not always conterminous with
the virtue itself, but sometimes another and more
excellent virtue intervenes; as in giving we may
pass from justice to liberality, and only through,
passing the bounds of liberality, do we arrive at the
vicious extreme of prodigality. So penitential fasting
intervenes between temperance in food and undue
neglect of sustenance. But it is to be noted that
the central virtue, so to speak, as justice, sobriety,
chastity, is for all persons on all occasions: the
more excellent side-virtue, as liberality, or total
abstinence, is for special occasions and special
classes of persons.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section V. -- <i>Of Cardinal Virtues</i>.</h2>

1. The enumeration of cardinal virtues is a piece
of Greek philosophy that has found its ways into the
catechism. Prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance 
are mentioned by Plato as recognised heads of
virtue. They are recognised, though less clearly, by
Xenophon, reporting the conversations of Socrates.
It does not look as though Socrates invented the
division: he seems to have received it from an
earlier source, possibly Pythagoras.  They are 
mentioned in Holy Scripture (Wisdom vii., 7, which is
however a Greek book), and Proverbs viii., 14. They
make no figure in the philosophies of India and
China.<p>

2. The cardinal virtues are thus made out. --
Virtue is a habit that gives a man readiness in
behaving according to the reason that is in him.
Such a habit may be fourfold. (a) It may reside
in the reason, or intellect itself, enabling it readily
to discern the reasonable thing to do, according to
particular circumstances as they occur. That habit
is the virtue of <i>prudence</i>. (b) It may reside in the
rational appetite, otherwise called the will, disposing
a man to act fairly and reasonably in his dealings
with other men. That is <i>justice</i>. (c) It may reside
in the irrational, or sensitive, appetite, and that to
a twofold purpose; (a) to restrain the said appetite 
in its concupiscible part from a wanton and
immoderate eagerness after pleasure; that is 
<i>temperance</i>: (b) to incite the said appetite in its
irascible part not to shrink from danger, where
there is reason for going on in spite of danger; that
is <i>fortitude</i>.<p>

3. Plato compares the rational soul in man to
a charioteer, driving two horses: one horse 
representing the concupiscible, the other the irascible
part of the Sensitive appetite.  He draws a vivid
picture of the resistance of the concupiscible part
against reason, how madly it rushes after lawless
pleasure, and how it is only kept in restraint by
main force again and again applied, till gradually
it grows submissive. This submissiveness, gradually
acquired, is the virtue of temperance.  Clearly the
habit dwells in the appetite, not in reason: in the
horse, not in the charioteer. It is that habitual
state, which in a horse we call <i>being broken in</i>.
The concupiscible appetite is broken in to reason
by temperance residing within it.  Plato lavishes all
evil names on the steed that represents the 
concupiscible part.  But the irascible part, the other
steed, has its own fault, and that fault twofold,
sometimes of over-venturesomeness, sometimes of
shying and turning tail.  The habit engendered, in
the irascible part, of being neither over-venturesome
nor over-timorous, but going by reason, is termed
fortitude. [It will help an Englishman to understand Plato's comparison,
If instead of concupiscible part and irascible part, we call the one steed
Passion and the other Pluck.  Pluck fails, and Passion runs to
excess, till Pluck is formed to fortitude, and Passion to temperance.]<p>

4. As the will is the rational appetite, the proper
object of which is rational good, it does not need to
be prompted by any habit to embrace rational good
in what concerns only the inward administration
of the agent's own self. There is no difficulty in
that department, provided the sensitive appetite be
kept in hand by fortitude and temperance. But
where there is question of external relations with
other men, it is not enough that the sensitive
appetite be regulated, but a third virtue is necessary,
the habit of justice, to be planted in the will, which
would otherwise be too weak to attend steadily to
points, not of the agent's own good merely, but of
the good of other men.<p>

5. Thus we have the four cardinal virtues:
prudence, a habit of the intellect; temperance,
a habit of the concupiscible appetite; fortitude, a
habit of the irascible appetite; and justice, a habit
of the will. Temperance and Fortitude in the
Home Department; justice for Foreign Affairs;
with Prudence for Premier. Or, to use another
comparison, borrowed from Plato, prudence is the
health of the soul, temperance its beauty, fortitude
its strength, and justice its wealth.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section VI. -- <i>Of Prudence</i>.</h2>

1. Prudence is <i>right reason applied to practice</i>, or
more fully it may be defined, the habit of intellectual
discernment that enables one to hit upon the golden
mean of moral virtue and the way to secure that
mean. Thus prudence tells one what amount of
punishment is proper for a particular delinquent,
and how to secure his getting it. It is to be 
observed that prudence does not will the golden mean
in question, but simply indicates it. To will and
desire the mean is the work of the moral virtue
concerned therewith: as in the case given it is the
work of vindictive justice.<p>

2. From the definition of moral virtue above
given (c. v., s. iv., n. 4, p. 79), it is clear that no
moral virtue can come into act without prudence:
for it is the judgment of the prudent man that must
define in each case the <i>golden mean</i> in relation to
ourselves, which every moral virtue aims at. Thus,
without prudence, fortitude passes into rashness,
vindictive justice into harshness, clemency into
weakness, religion into superstition.<p>

3. But may not one with no prudence to guide
him hit upon the <i>golden mean</i> by some happy
impulse, and thus do an act of virtue? We answer,
he may do a good act, and if you will, a virtuous act,
but not an act of virtue, not an act proceeding from
a pre-existent habit in the doer. The act is like a
good stroke made by chance, not by skill; and like
such a stroke, it cannot be readily repeated at the
agent's pleasure. (See c. v., s. i., n. 4, p. 66; and
Ar., <i>Eth.</i>, II., iv., 2.)<p>

4. Prudence in its essence is an intellectual virtue,
being a habit resident in the understanding: but it
deals with the subject-matter of the moral virtues,
pointing out the measure of temperance, the bounds
of fortitude, or the path of justice. It is the habit
of intellectual discernment that must enlighten every
moral virtue in its action.  There is no virtue that
goes blundering and stumbling in the dark.<p>

5. He is a prudent man, that can give counsel to
others and to himself in order to the attainment of
ends that are worthy of human endeavour. If
unworthy ends are intended, however sagaciously
they are pursued, that is not prudence. We may
call it sagacity, or shrewdness, being a habit of ready
discernment and application of means to ends.
Napoleon I. was conspicuous for this sagacity. It
is the key to success in this world. But prudence
discovers worthy ends only, and to them only does
it provide means. The intellect is often blinded by
passion, by desire and by fear, so as not to discern
the proper end and term to make for in a particular
instance and a practical case. The general rules of
conduct remain in the mind, as that, "In anger be
mindful of mercy:" but the propriety of mercy
under the present provocation drops out of sight.  
The intellect does not discern the golden mean of
justice and mercy in relation to the circumstances
in which the agent now finds himself. In other
words, the habit of prudence has failed; and it has
failed because of the excess of passion.  Thus 
prudence is dependent on the presence of the virtues
that restrain passion, namely, fortitude and 
temperance. A like argument would hold for the virtue
of justice, that rectifies inordinate action in dealing
with another. The conclusion is, that as the moral
virtues cannot exist without prudence, so neither
can prudence exist without them: for vice corrupts
the judgment of prudence.<p>

6. Hence we arrive at a settlement of the question,
whether the virtues can be separated, or whether to
possess one is to possess all. We must distinguish
between the rudimentary forms of virtue and the
perfect habit. The rudimentary forms certainly can
exist separate: they are a matter of temperament
and inherited constitution: and the man whom
nature has kindly predisposed to benevolence, she
has perhaps very imperfectly prepared for prudence,
fortitude, or sobriety. But one perfect habit of any
one of the four cardinal virtues, acquired by repeated
acts, and available at the call of reason, involves the
presence, in a matured state, of the other three
habits also. A man who acts irrationally upon one
ground, will behave irrationally on other grounds
also: or if his conduct be rational there, it will not
be from regard for reason, but from impulse, 
temperament, or from some other motive than the
proper motive of the virtue which he seems to be
exercising.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section VII. -- <i>Of Temperance</i>.</h2>

1. Temperance is a virtue which regulates by the
judgment of reason those desires and delights which
attend upon the operations whereby human nature
is preserved in the individual and propagated in the
species. Temperance is the virtue contrary to the
two deadly sins of Gluttony and Lust. As against
the former, it represents Abstinence, or moderation
in solid food, and Sobriety, which is moderation in
drink. As against the latter, it is the great virtue of
Chastity. The student must bear in mind that, to
a philosopher, Temperance does not mean Total
Abstinence, and Abstinence is quite independent of
Fridays and flesh-meat. Temperance then is made
up of Abstinence, Sobriety, and Chastity.
Aristotle writes : "Cases of falling short in
the taking of pleasure, and of people enjoying
themselves less than they ought, are not apt to
occur: for such insensibility is not human: but if
there be any one to whom nothing is pleasant, and
all comes alike in the matter of taste, he must be far
from the state and condition of humanity: such a
being has no name, because he is nowhere met
with." This is true, because where there is question
of a virtue, such as Temperance, resident in the
concupiscible appetite, we are not concerned with
any sullenness or moroseness of will, nor with any
scrupulosity or imbecility of judgment, refusing to
gratify the reasonable cravings of appetite, but with
the habitual leaning and lie of the appetite itself.
Now the concupiscible appetite in every man, of its
own nature, leans to its proper object of delectable
good. No virtue is requisite to secure it from
too little inclination that way: but to restrain the
appetite from going out excessively to delight is the
function, and the sole function, of Temperance.
The measure of restraint is relative, as the golden
mean is relative, and varies with different persons
and in view of different ends. The training of the
athlete is not the training of the saint.<p>

3. Besides the primary virtue of Temperance, and
its subordinate species (enumerated above, n. i),
certain other virtues are brought under Temperance
in a secondary sense, as observing in easier matters
that moderation and self-restraint which the primary
virtue keeps in the matter that is most difficult of
all.  St. Thomas calls these <i>potential parts</i> of 
Temperance.  There is question here of what is most
difficult to man as an animal, not of what is most
difficult to him as a rational being. To rational man,
as such, ambition is harder to restrain than sensuality: 
which is proved by the fact that fewer men, who
have any ambition in them, do restrain that passion
than those who restrain the animal propensities that
are common to all. But to man as an animal (and
vast numbers of the human race rise little above the
animal state), it is hardest of all things to restrain
those appetites that go with the maintenance and
propagation of flesh and blood. These then are
the proper matter of Temperance: other, virtues,
potential parts of Temperance, restrain other
cravings which are less animal. Of these virtues
the most noticeable are humility, meekness, and
modesty.
[This is St.Thomas's arrangement, placing Humility under
Temperance. The connection of Humility with Magnanimity, and
thereby with Fortitude, is indicated pp. 100, 101.<p>

4. There is a thirst after honour and pre-eminence, 
arising from self-esteem, and prevalent
especially where there is little thought of God, and
scant reverence for the present majesty of heaven.
A man who thinks little of his Maker is great in his
own eyes, as our green English hills are mountains
to one who has not seen the Alpine heights and
snows.  Apart from the consideration of God there
is no humility; and this is why Aristotle, who treats
of virtues as they minister to the dealings of man
with man, makes no mention of this virtue.  There
are certain outward manifestations in words, acts,
and gestures, the demeanour of a humble man,
which is largely identified with modesty and with
submission to others as representing God.<p>

5. Modesty is that outward comportment, style
of dress, conversation, and carriage, which 
indicates the presence of Temperance, "set up on
holy pedestal (Plato, <i>Phadr.</i>, 254 B) in the heart
within.<p>

6. Meekness is moderation in anger, and is or
should be the virtue of all men. Clemency is
moderation in punishment, and is the virtue of men
in office, who bear the sword or the rod.<p>

7. As regards the vices opposite to Temperance,
an important distinction is to be drawn between
him who sins by outburst of passion and him whose
very principles are corrupt. [See the note in <i>Aquinas 
Ethicus</i>, Vol. I., pp.  170, 171.] The former in doing
evil acknowledges it to be evil, and is prone to repent
of it afterwards: the latter has lost his belief in
virtue, and his admiration for it: he drinks in iniquity
like water, with no after-qualms; he glories in his
shame. The former is reclaimable, the latter is
reprobate: his intellect as well as his heart is
vitiated and gone bad. If there were no miracles,
he would be a lost man: but God can work miracles
in the moral as in the physical order: in that there
is hope for him.<p>

8. A nation need not be virtuous in the great
bulk of her citizens, to be great in war and in
dominion, in laws, in arts, and in literature: but the
bulk of the people must possess at least the sense
and appreciation of virtue in order to such national
greatness.  When that sense is lost, the nation
is undone and become impotent, for art no less
than for empire. Thus the Greece of Pericles and
of Phidias fell, to be "living Greece no more."<p>

9. As in other moral matters, no hard and fast
line of division exists between sinning from passion
and sinning on principle, but cases of the one
shade into cases of the others, and by frequent
indulgence of passion principle is brought gradually
to decay.

<hr><p><h2>Section VIII. -- <i>Of Fortitude</i>.</h2>

1. As Temperance is a curb, restraining animal
nature in the pursuit of the good to which it goes out
most eagerly, namely, life and the means of its continuance, 
so Fortitude also is a curb, withholding that
nature from irrational flight from the evil which it
most dreads. Aristotle tells us what that evil is: " Most
dreadful of all things is death, for it is the limit, and
for the dead man there appears to be no further good
nor evil left." (<i>Eth.</i>, III., vi., 6.) Death is truly the
limit to human existence: for, though the soul be
immortal, the being of flesh and blood, that we call
man, is dissolved in death, and, apart from supernatural 
hope of the resurrection, extinct for ever.
Death therefore is the direst of all evils in the animal
economy; and as such, is supremely abhorred by
the sensitive appetite, which is the animal part of
man.  Fortitude moderates this abhorrence and fear
by the dictate of reason. Reason shows that there
are better things than life, and things worse than
death, for man in his spiritual capacity as an
intellectual and immortal being.<p>

2. Fortitude is a mean between Cowardice
and Rashness, to which opposite extremes we are
carried by the contrary passions of Fear and
Daring respectively. Fortitude thus is a two-sided 
virtue moderating two opposite tendencies:
while Temperance is one-sided, moderating Desire
alone. Life, rationally considered, bears 
undoubtedly a high value, and is not to be lightly
thrown away, or risked upon trivial or ignoble
objects. The brave man is circumspect in his
ventures, and moderate in his fears, which implies
that he does fear somewhat. He will fear superhuman 
visitations, as the judgments of God. He
will dread disgrace, and still more, sin.  He will fear
death in an unworthy cause. And even in a good
cause, it has well been said: "The truly brave man
is not he who fears no danger, but the man whose
mind subdues the fear, and braves the danger that
nature shrinks from." The Duke of Marlborough is
said to have quaked in the saddle as he rode into
action, saying: "This poor body trembles at what
the mind within is about to do." Fortitude then is
the virtue that restrains fear and regulates 
venturesomeness by the judgment of reason, in danger
especially of a grand and glorious death.<p>

3. To the ancients, there was no grander object
of devotion than the State, their native city: no
direr misfortune than its dissolution, or the loss of
its self-government: no nobler death than to die in
arms in its defence.  As old Tyrtacus sang<p><p>

<ul>
     A noble thing it is to lie dead, fallen in the front ranks,<br>
     A brave man in battle for his country.<p><p>

     [<b>tethnamenai gar kalon, eni promachoisi pesonta,<br>
     andr' agathon peri h&ecirc; patridi marnamenon.</b>]<p>
</ul><p>

Such a death was taken to be the seal and stamp
of the highest fortitude. Nor has Christianity
dimmed the glory that invests a soldier's death.
Only it points to a brighter glory, and a death in a
still nobler cause, the death of the martyr who dies
for the faith, and becomes valiant in battle for what
is more to him than any earthly city, the Church,
the City of God. Nor must the martyr of charity.
who dies in succouring his neighbour, go without
the praise of fortitude: nor, in short, any one who
braves death, or other heavy affliction, in the 
discharge of duty, or when forwarding a good cause.<p>

4. A man may brave death in a good cause, and
not be doing an act of fortitude. So he may 
subscribe a large sum to a charitable purpose without
any exercise of the virtue of charity. A virtue is
then only exercised, when its outward act is performed 
from the proper motive of the virtue, and not
from any lower motive. Thus the proper motive
of Fortitude is the conviction that death is an evil,
the risk of which is to be left out of count as a 
circumstance relatively inconsiderable, when there is
question of the defence of certain interests dearer to
a good man than life. An improper motive would
be anger, which, however useful as an accessory, by
itself is not an intellectual motive at all, and 
therefore no motive of virtue. The recklessness of an
angry man is not Fortitude. It is not Fortitude to be
brave from ignorance or stupidity, not appreciating
the danger: nor again from experience, knowing
that the apparent danger is not real, at least to
yourself. The brave man looks a real danger in the
face, and knows it, and goes on in spite of it, because
so it is meet and just, with the cause that he has, to
go on.<p>

5. We may notice as <i>potential</i> parts of Fortitude
(s. vii., n. 3., p. 92), the three virtues of Magnificence, 
Magnanimity, and Patience. It is the part of
Patience, philosophically to endure all sufferings short
of death.  It is the part of the former two, to dare
wisely, not in a matter of life and death, but in the
matter of expense, for Magnificence, and of honour,
for Magnanimity. Magnificence, technically understood, 
observes the right measure in the expenditure
of large sums of money. As being conversant with
large sums, it differs from Liberality. A poor man
may be liberal out of his little store, but never
magnificent. It is a virtue in the rich, not to be
afraid of spending largely and lavishly on a great
occasion, or a grand purpose. The expense may be
carried beyond what the occasion warrants : that is
one vicious extreme. The other extreme would be
to mar a costly work by sordid parsimony on a point
of detail.  It is not easy to be magnificent: in the
first place, because not many are rich; and then
because riches are seldom united with greatness of
Soul and good judgment.  Something analogous to
the virtue of Magnificence is shown in the generous
use of great abilities, or, in the supernatural order,
of great graces. The destinies of the world lie with
those men who have it in their power to be magnificent.<p>

6. We are come to Magnanimity and the Magnanimous 
Man, the great creation of Aristotle. As
Magnanimity ranks under Fortitude, there must be
some fear to which the Magnanimous Man rises
superior, as the brave man rises superior to the fear
of death.  What Magnanimity overcomes is the fear
of undeserved dishonour. The Magnanimous Man
is he who rates himself as worthy of great honours,
and is so worthy indeed. When honour is paid
to such a one, he makes no great account of it,
feeling that it is but his due, or even less than his
due. If he is dishonoured and insulted, he despises
the insult as an absurdity, offered to a man of his
deserts. He is too conscious of his real worth to
be much affected by the expression of his neighbour's 
view of him.  For a man is most elated,
when complimented on an excellence which he was
not very sure of possessing: and most sensibly
grieved at an insult, where he half suspects himself
of really making a poor figure, whereas he would
like to make a good one. It is doubtless the serene
and settled conviction that Englishmen generally
entertain of the greatness of their country, that
enables them to listen with equanimity to abuse of
England, such as no other people in Europe would
endure levelled at themselves.<p>

7. <i>Proud</i> is an epithet pretty freely applied to
Englishmen abroad, and it seems to fit the character
of the Magnanimous Man.  He seems a Pharisee,
and worse than a Pharisee.  The Pharisee's pride
was to some extent mitigated by breaking out into
that disease of children and silly persons, vanity:
he "did all his works to be seen of men." But
here the disease is all driven inwards, and therefore
more malignant.  The Magnanimous Man is so
much in conceit with himself as to have become a
scorner of his fellows. He is self-sufficient, a deity
to himself, the very type of Satanic pride. These
are the charges brought against him.<p>

8. To purify and rectify the character of the
Magnanimous Man, we need to take a leaf out of
the book of Christianity. Not that there is anything
essentially Christian and supernatural in what we
are about to allege: otherwise it would not belong
to philosophy: it is a truth of reason, but a truth
generally overlooked, till it found its exponent in the
Christian preacher, and its development in the
articles of the Christian faith. The truth is this.
There is in every human being what theologians
have called <i>man and man</i>: man as he is of himself,
man again as he is by the gift and gracious mercy
of God. The reasonably Magnanimous Man is
saved from pride by this distinction. Of himself,
he knows that he is nothing but nothingness, meanness, 
sinfulness, and a walking sore of multitudinous
actual sins. "I know that there dwelleth not in
me, that is, in my flesh, any good." (Rom. vii. 18.)
If he is insulted, he takes it as his due, not any
questionable due, for then he would resent the
insult, but as being undoubtedly what he deserves.
If he is honoured, he smiles at the absurdity of the
compliments paid to him. It is as if an old gentleman, 
a prey to gout and rheumatism, were lauded
for his fleetness of foot. He is then truly magnanimous 
on this side of his character by a kind of
obverse magnanimity, that bears insults handsomely,
as deserved, and honours modestly, as undeserved.<p>

9. But let us go round to the other side of the
reasonably Magnanimous Man. He was defined
to be, "one that deems himself worthy of great
honours, and is so worthy indeed." Now, nothing is,
truly worthy of honour but virtue.  He must then
be a good man, full of all virtues; and all this 
goodness that he has, he recognises as being in him
of God. He has "received God's Spirit" -- or
something analogous in the natural order to the
gift of the Holy Ghost -- "that he may know the
things that are given him of God." (2 Cor. ii. 12.)
It is told of St. Francis of Assisi, the humblest of
men, that on one occasion when he and his companions 
received from some persons extraordinary
marks of veneration, he, contrary to his usual wont,
took it not at all amiss: and said to his companions,
who wondered at his behaviour, "Let them alone:
they cannot too much honour the work of God in
us." This magnanimity bears honours gracefully,
and insult unflinchingly, from a consciousness of
internal worth, which internal worth and goodness
however it takes not for its own native excellence,
but holds as received from God, and unto God it
refers all the glory.<p>

10. Thus the genuine Magnanimous Man is a
paradox and a prodigy. He despises an insult as
undeserved, and he takes it as his due. He is
conscious of the vast good that is in him ; and he
knows that there is no good in him. Highly
honoured, he thinks that he gets but his due, while
he believes that vials of scorn and ignominy may
justly be poured upon him.  He will bear the scorn,
because he deserves it, and again, because it is
wholly undeserved. The Magnanimous Man is the
humble man. The secret of his marvellous virtue is
his habit of practical discernment between the abyss
of misery that he has within himself, as of himself,
and the high gifts, also within him, which come of
the mercy of God. Aristotle well says, " Magnanimity 
is a sort of robe of honour to the rest of the
virtues: it both makes them greater and stands
not without them: therefore it is hard to be truly
magnanimous, for that cannot be without perfect
virtue." We may add, that in the present order of
Providence none can be magnanimous without
supernatural aid, and supernatural considerations
of the life of Christ, which however are not in
place here.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section IX. -- <i>Of Justice</i>.</h2>

1. Justice is a habit residing in the will, prompting 
that power constantly to render unto everyone
his own. The fundamental notion of justice is some
sort of equality. Equality supposes two terms,
physically distinct, or capable of existing separately,
one from the other.  Between such terms alone can
equality be properly predicated. Any less distinction 
than this leaves room only for equality improperly 
so called, and therefore no room for what
is properly termed justice. When therefore Plato,
going about to find a definition of justice, which is
a main object in his <i>Republic</i>, acquiesces in this
position, that justice consists in every part of the
soul, rational, irascible, and concupiscible, fulfilling
its own proper function, and not taking up the
function of another, he fails for this reason, that all
justice is relative to another, but the different parts
of one soul are not properly other and other, since all
go to make up one man: therefore, however much
justice may be identical with doing your own business, 
and leaving your neighbour free to do his, yet
this relation obtaining among the various parts of
the soul cannot properly be called justice.  What
Plato defines is the beauty, good order, and moral
comeliness of the soul, but not justice in any sense,
inasmuch as it is not referred to any being human
or divine, collective or individual, outside of the
man himself.<p>

2. Going upon the principle that all justice is of
the nature of <i>equality</i>, and is therefore relative <i>to
another</i>, we arrive at the definition of <i>general justice</i>,
which is all virtue whatsoever, inasmuch as it bears
upon another person than him who practises it.
This justice is perfect social virtue, the crown and
perfection of all virtue from a statesman's point of
view; and in that aspect, as Aristotle says, "neither
morning star nor evening star is so beautiful."
Whoever has this virtue behaves well, not by himself
merely, but towards others -- a great addition. Many
a one who has done well enough as an individual,
has done badly in a public capacity: whence the
proverb, that office shows the man. This justice
may well be called <i>another man's good</i>: though not
in the sense of the sophists of old, and the altruists
of our time, that virtue is a very good thing for
everyone else than its possessor.  Virtue, like health,
may be beneficial to neighbours, but the first benefit
of it flows in upon the soul to whom it belongs: for
virtue is the health of the soul.<p>

3. Another elementary notion of justice connects
it with Law, taking justice to be conformity to Law.  
This notion exhibits <i>legal justice</i>, which is the same
thing, under another aspect, as the <i>general justice</i>
mentioned above, inasmuch as <i>general justice</i> includes 
the exercise of all virtues in so far as they
bear upon the good of others and the law, to which
<i>legal justice</i> conforms a man, enjoins acts of all
virtues for the common good.  It must be observed,
however, that though there is no natural virtue of
which the law of man may not prescribe some exercise, 
still no human law enjoins all acts of all virtues,
not even all obligatory acts. A man may fail in his
duty though he has kept all the laws of man. In
order then that <i>legal justice</i> may include the whole
duty of man, it must be referred to that natural and
eternal law of God, revealed or unrevealed, of which
we shall speak hereafter. By being conformed to
this divine law a man is a <i>just man</i>, a <i>righteous man</i>.  
It is this sense of justice that appears in the 
theological term, <i>justification</i>. In this sense, Zachary
and Elizabeth "were both just before God, walking
in all the commandments of the Lord without
blame." (St. Luke 1. 6.)<p>

4. <i>General</i>, or <i>legal, justice</i> is not the cardinal
virtue so called, but is in one point of view identical
with all virtue. Distinguished from the other three
cardinal virtues is <i>particular justice</i>, which is divided
into <i>distributive</i> and <i>commutative justice. Distributive
justice</i> is exercised by the community through its
head towards its individual members, so that there
be a fair distribution of the common goods, in varying 
amount and manner, according to the various
merits and deserts of the several recipients. The
matters distributed are public emoluments and
honours, public burdens, rewards, and also punishments. 
<i>Distributive justice</i> is the virtue of the king
and of the statesman, of the commander-in-chief,
of the judge, and of the public functionary generally. 
It is violated by favouritism, partiality, and
jobbery.  Distributive justice is the justice that we
adore in the great Governor of the Universe, saying
that He is "just in all His works," even though we
understand them not.  When it takes the form of
punishing, it is called <i>vindictive justice</i>. This is what
the multitudes clamoured for, that filled the precincts 
of the Palace of Whitehall in the days of
Charles I. with cries of justice, justice, for the
head of Strafford.<p>

5. Neither legal nor distributive justice fully
answers to the definition of that virtue. justice
disposes us to give <i>to another his own</i>. The party
towards whom justice is practised must be wholly
other and different from him who practises it. But
it is clear that the member of a civil community is
not wholly other and different from the State: he
is partially identified with the civil community to
which he belongs.  Therefore neither the tribute of
<i>legal justice</i> paid by the individual to the State, nor
the grant of <i>distributive justice</i> from the State to the
individual, is an exercise of justice in the strictest
sense. Again, what the individual pays to the State
because he is legally bound to pay it, does not
become the <i>State's own</i> until after payment. If he
withhold it, though he do wrong, yet he is not said
to be keeping any portion of the public property in
his private hands: he only fails to make some of his
private property public, which the law bids him
abdicate and make over. If this be true of money
and goods, it is still more evidently true of honour
and services. In like manner, in the matter of 
<i>distributive justice</i>, the emoluments which a Subject
has a claim to, the rewards which he has merited of
the State, does not become <i>his</i> till he actually gets
them into his hands. It may be unfair and immoral
that they are withheld from him, and in that case,
so long as the circumstances remain the same, the
obligation rests with and presses upon the State,
and those who represent it, to satisfy his claim: still
the State is not keeping the individual from that
which is as yet his own.  In the language of the
Roman lawyers, he has at best a <i>jus ad rem</i>, a right
that the thing be made his, but not a <i>jus in re</i>; that
is, the thing is not properly his before he actually
gets it.<p>

6. <i>Commutative justice</i> alone is justice strictly so
called -- for therein alone the parties to the act are
perfectly other and other, and the matter that
passes between them, if withheld by one of the
parties, would make a case of keeping the other out
of that which he could still properly call by right his
own. <i>Commutative justice</i> runs between two individuals, 
or two independent States, or between the
State and an individual inasmuch as the latter is an
independent person, having rights of his own against
the former.  This justice is called commutative, from
being concerned with exchanges, or contracts, Voluntary 
and involuntary.  The idea of voluntary contract, 
like that between buyer and seller, is familiar
enough. But the notion of an involuntary contract is
technical, and requires explanation.  Whoever, then,
wrongfully takes that which belongs to another,
enters into an involuntary contract, or makes an
involuntary exchange, with the party. This he may
do by taking away his property, honour, reputation,
liberty, or bodily ease and comfort. This is an
involuntary transaction, against the will of the party
that suffers. It is a contract, because the party that
does the damage takes upon himself, whether he will
or no, by the very act of doing it, the obligation of
making the damage good, and of restoring what he
has taken away.  This is the obligation of <i>restitution</i>,
which attaches to breaches of <i>commutative justice</i>,
and, strictly speaking, to them alone. Thus, if a
minister has not promoted a deserving officer in
face of a clear obligation of <i>distributive justice</i>, the
obligation indeed remains as that of a duty unfulfilled, 
so long as he remains minister with the
patronage in his hands: but the promotion, if he
finally makes it, is not an act of restitution: it is
giving to the officer that which was not his before.  
And if the opportunity has passed, he owes the
officer nothing in compensation. But if he has
insulted the officer, he owes him an apology for all
time to come: he must give back that honour which
belonged to the officer, and of which he has robbed
him. This is restitution. In a thousand practical
cases it is important, and often a very nice question
to decide, whether a particular offence, such as
failure to pay taxes, be a sin against commutative
justice or only against some more general form of
the virtue. If the former, restitution is due: if the
latter, repentance only and purpose of better things
in future, but not reparation of the past.<p>

7. The old notion, that justice is minding your
own business, and leaving your neighbour to mind
his, furnishes a good rough statement of the 
obligations of <i>commutative justice</i>.  They are mainly
negative, to leave your neighbour alone in his right
of life and limb, of liberty and property, of honour
and reputation. But in two ways your neighbour's
business may become yours in justice. The first
way is, if you have any contract with him, whether
a formal contract, as that between a railway company 
and its passengers, or a virtual contract, by
reason of some office that you bear, as the office
of a bishop and pastor in relation to the souls of
his flock. The second way in which <i>commutative
justice</i> binds you to positive action, is when undue
damage is likely to occur to another from some
activity of yours, If, passing by, I see my neighbour's 
house on fire, not having contracted to watch
it for him, and not having caused the fire myself, I
am not bound in strict justice to warn him of his
danger. I am bound indeed by charity, but that is
not the point here. But if the fire has broken out
from my careless use of fire, <i>commutative justice</i>
binds me to raise the alarm.<p>

8. The most notable potential parts of justice --
Religion, Obedience, Truthfulness -- enter into the
treatise of Natural Law.<p>
