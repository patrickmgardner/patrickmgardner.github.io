<b>PART II. NATURAL LAW.</b><p>

WE assume in Natural Law the preceding treatise
on Ethics, and also the principal truths of Natural
Theology.<p>

<h1>Chapter I. Of Duties of God.</h1>

<hr><p><h2>Section I. -- Of the Worship of God.</h2>

1. Worship is divided into Prayer and Praise. To
pray, and present our petitions to the Most High, is
a privilege; a privilege, however, which we are bound
to use at times, as the necessary means for 
overcoming temptations and inclinations to evil. We
praise and adore God for His sovereign excellence,
which excellence, nevertheless, would found in us no
positive duty if we stood free of all dependence upon
God. In such an hypothesis we should lie simply
under the negative duty of not thinking of God,
speaking of Him, or acting towards Him otherwise
than with all reverence. So we should behave to
the Great Stranger, with civility, with admiration
even and awe, but not with cordiality, not with
loyalty, not with homage, not with love. Very
different are our relations and our duties to God
our Lord, "in whom we live, move, and have our
being." There is nothing in us or about us, no positive
perfection of ours whatsoever, that is not His gift,
and a gift that He is not giving continually, else it
would be lost to us.  We are therefore bound in
His regard, not merely to abstention but to act.  
And first, for inward acts, we must habitually feel,
and at notable intervals we must actually elicit,
sentiments of adoration and praise, of thanksgiving,
of submission, of loyalty and love, as creatures to
their Creator, and as vassals to their very good
Lord, for He is our Creator and Lord in the
natural order, not to say anything here of the
supernatural filiation, by which, as the Church says,
"we dare" to call God "Our Father."<p>

2. We must also express these sentiments by
outward act. All the signs of reverence, which man
pays to his human superior, must be paid to God
"with advantages": bowing passes into prostration, 
uncovering the head into kneeling, kissing the
hand into offering of incense : not that these 
particular developments are necessary, but some such
development must take place. We shall not be
content to think reverential thoughts, but we shall
say, or even sing, great things of God's greatness
and our indebtedness and duty: such a vocal
exercise is psalmody. We shall represent in
symbolic action our dependence on the Lord of
life and death, and also our sinfulness, for which
He might justly strike us dead: such a representation 
is sacrifice.<p>

3. All this we must do, first, for the sake of our
own souls, minds and hearts, to quicken the inward
sentiment of adoration and praise. "Worship,
mostly of the silent sort," worship, that finds no
expression in word or gesture, -- worship away from
pealing organs and chants of praise, or the simpler
music of the human voice, where no hands are
uplifted, nor tongues loosened, nor posture of
reverence assumed, becomes with most mortals a
vague, aimless reverie, a course of distraction,
dreaminess, and vacancy of mind, no more worth
than the meditations of the Lancashire stone
breaker, who was asked what he thought of during
his work, -- "Mostly nowt."<p>

4. Again, what the body is to the soul, that is
exterior devotion to interior. From the soul interior
devotion springs, and through the body it manifests
itself.  Exterior devotion, without the inward spirit
that quickens it, is worship unprofitable and dead:
it tends at once to corruption, like the body when
the soul has left it. Interior devotion, on the other
hand, can exist, though not with its full complement,
without the exterior.  So that it is only in the union
of the two together that perfect worship is given to
God by men as men.  Upon which St. Thomas has
this naive remark, that "they who blame bodily
observances being paid to God, evidently fail to
remember that they, themselves are men,"<p>

Thus we pay tithe to God for soul and body,
by acts of religion interior and exterior.  But man
is, under God, the lord of this earth and of the
fulness thereof. He must pay tithe for that too by
devoting some portion of it to the direct service of
God, to whom it all primarily belongs. For "mine
is the gold and mine the silver." (Aggeus ii. 9.) Such
are the words that God spoke through His prophet
to incite His people to restore his sanctuary.<p>

6. It is therefore not true to say that the sole
reason of outward worship is to move the worshipper 
to interior devotion. It is not true that
St. Peter's at Rome, and Cologne Cathedral, and
the Duomo of Milan, with all their wealth and
elaborate ceremonial, exist and are kept up solely
because, things of earth as we are, we cannot be
depended upon to praise God lovingly within the
white-washed walls of a conventicle, or according
to the simple ritual of the Society of Friends.  We
would not, even if we could, pray habitually among
such surroundings, where we could afford to better
them.  We have before us the principle of St.
Thomas (1a 2ae, q. 24, art. 3, in corp.):<p>

"Since man's good consists in reason as in its
root, the more actions proper to man are performed
under the direction of reason, the more perfect will
man's good be.  Hence no one doubts that it belongs
to the perfection of moral good, that the actions of
our bodily members should be directed by the law
of reason, . . . as also that the passions of the
soul should be regulated by reason."<p>

This means, not merely that if the bodily members
or the passions stir at all, it is a good and desirable
thing for them to be ruled by reason; but further
that it is a positive addition to human perfection
that they should stir and be active, provided reason
guide them. (<i>Ethics</i>, C. iv., s. i., n. 6, p. 45.)
It certainly is an action proper to man to express
in gesture, in voice, in concert and company with
his fellow-men, and by employment of whatever is
best and fairest and brightest under his command
in the material creation, his inward affections of
loyalty, of homage and devotion, of awe and
reverence, of gratitude and love to his Creator.
Good as these affections are in the heart of the
worshipper, they receive an external complement of
goodness and perfection by being blazoned forth in
vocal utterance, singing, bending of knees, by the
erection and embellishment of temples, and offerings
of gold, silver, precious stones, and incense, and
by men thronging those temples in multitudes for
social worship, provided always that the inward
devotion of the heart be there, to put a soul into
these outward demonstrations and offerings.<p>

7. Concerning these religious observances interior
and exterior, it is as idle to pretend that they are
useful to Almighty God as it is irrelevant to object
that they are useless to Him.  Of course they are
useless to Him. All creation is useless to God. A
Being who can never receive any profit, increment
or gain, dwells not within the region of utilities.
Theologians indeed distinguish between intrinsic
and extrinsic glory, that is, between the glory which
God gives Himself by His own contemplation of                                      ,n of
His own essence, and the glory which His creatures
give Him.  They say that God is thus capable of
extrinsic increment, to which increment the praise
and worship of His creatures is useful. But, after
all, they are fain to avow that the whole of this
extrinsic increment and glory is no real gain to God,
giving Him nothing but what He had before in an
infinitely more excellent mode and manner from
and of Himself.  Thus it appears that the extrinsic
glory of God, to which the worship paid Him by
man contributes, is valued, not because it is properly
useful to Him, but because He is most properly and
highly worthy of it. "Thou art worthy, O Lord
our God, to receive glory and honour and power:
because thou hast created all things, and for thy will
they were, and have been created." (Apoc. iv. 11.)
And being worthy of this glory, He wills to have it,
and does most strictly exact it, for which reason He
is called in the Scripture a Jealous God.  So those
who reflect some sparkle of God's Majesty, and
under some aspect represent His person upon the
earth, as do princes, lay and ecclesiastical, have
many observances of honour and respect paid to
them, which are not useful as supplying a need -- for
who needs a salute of twenty-one guns? Nevertheless 
their dignity is worthy of them, and they require
them accordingly.<p>

8. What man feels strongly, he expresses in
word and action. What all men feel strongly, they
express by meeting together for the purpose.  So
that, if strong religious feeling is an element in
every good and reasonable man's character, it is
bound to find expression, and that a social expression.  
Men must worship together according to
some external form and ritual.  God may reveal
what He wills that ritual to be.  In fact He did
give such a revelation and prescription to the Jews.  
To Christians He has spoken in His Son, and still
speaks in His Church.  Any other than the one
sacrifice that He has instituted, or any other public
religious ritual than is approved by the religious
authority which he has established, is to Him of
itself, and apart from the invincibly erroneous
devotion of them that pay it, an abomination: for
He has "not chosen it." Still we cannot say that,
in every possible state of things, God is bound to
reveal the ritual that He desires, or is bound Himself
to designate the authority that shall fix the ritual
which alone He will accept and allow of. If the
will of God is not thus expressed, a ritual must still
be drawn up.  In a matter that excites the mind, as
religion does, and where a large field is open for
hallucination and eccentricity, it will not do to have
individuals parading methods of worship of their
own invention. Here the Greek maxim comes in,
<b>tima to daimonion kata ta patria</b>, "honour the
Deity after the fashion of thy country." Religious
authorities must be set up, in the same way that
the civil power is set up. These authorities will
determine, not the object, but the outward manner of
worship.  Every great nation, or important member
of the human family, would come probably to have
its own characteristic rite; and within each rite
there would be local varieties.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- Of Superstitious Practices.</h2>

1. Superstition is the abuse of religion. It is
superstition, either to worship false gods, or to
worship the true God with unauthorized rites, or
to have dealings with wicked spirits, whether those
spirits have once animated human bodies or not.  
Of the first head, the only avowed instance within
our civilization is the Positivist worship of the
Great Being, that is, of the collective Worthies of
Humanity, if indeed it amounts to worship. The
second head might have been meditated by Archbishop 
Cranmer with advantage, when he was
drawing up the Edwardine Ordinal. Under the
third head comes Spiritualism, which we shall
here not discuss in detail, but merely indicate certain
principles upon which it must be judged.<p>

2. "There is nothing superstitious or unlawful
in simply applying natural agencies to the production 
of certain effects, of which they are supposed
to be naturally capable. . . . We must consider
whether there is a fair appearance of the cause
being able to produce the effect naturally. If there
is, the experiment will not be unlawful: for it is
lawful to use natural causes in order to their proper
effects." (2a 2ae, q. 96, art. 2, in corp., ad 1.) But
this we must understand under two provisos.  First,
that the fair appearance spoken of be not opposed
by a considerable force of evidence, whether of
authority or of reason, tending the other way: for
in this matter, which is not a mere matter of
legality, it is not permissible to run risks of 
becoming familiar with God's enemies. Secondly, that
the cause, though natural, be not morally prejudicial.  
Not even a natural cause, brandy for instance, may
be used to all its effects. Thus for the mesmeric
sleep, though that should be proved to be purely
natural, yet the weakening of the will thence ensuing, 
and the almost irresistible dominion acquired
by the operator over his patient, render it imperative
that such a remedy should not be applied without
grave necessity, and under an operator of assured
moral character.<p>

3. St. Thomas continues in the place last quoted:
"Wherefore, if there is no fair appearance of
the causes employed being able to produce such
effects, it needs must be that they are not employed
to the causation of these effects as causes, but only
as signs, and thus they come under the category 
of preconcerted signals arranged with evil
spirits."<p>

The modern Spiritualist is only too forward to
avow his understanding with the unseen powers;
but he will have it that the spirits that he deals
with are good and harmless. We must prove the
spirits by the general effects of their communications
-- whether they be in accordance with the
known laws of morality, and the assured teachings 
of religion, natural and revealed. Also we
must consider, from what we know from approved
sources concerning God, and I-lis holy angels, and
the spirits of the just, either already made perfect,
or still suffering for a time, whether they are likely
to respond to such signs as Spiritualists commonly
employ. Also we must not ignore, what revelation
tells us, of an "enemy," a "father of lies," who
"changes himself into an angel of light," and who
is ever ready, so far as it is permitted him, to eke
out curiosity, folly, and credulity, such as he found
in Eve.<p>

art. 4, in corp.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section III. -- Of the duty of knowing God.</h2>

1. Religious worship is bound to its object, and
cannot possibly be fixed in the hearts of men and
the institutions of society, if the object be doubtful
and fluctuating. False religion has often been set
off with elaborate and gorgeous ceremonial, which
has been kept up even after the performers had
come to see in all that light and lustre a mere vain
and unsubstantial show. Such were the rites of
Roman polytheism, as enacted by augurs and
pontiffs, the colleagues of Cicero and Caesar.  But
though that worship was maintained, and even
augmented, for political purposes, without a creed,
yet never could it have arisen without some creed,
however mistaken, earnestly held of, old. A firm
interior conviction is the starting-point of all
outward worship. But if the modern living worshipper 
is without creed and conviction; if he be
a scoffer at heart, or at least a doubter; what a
hollow, horrid skeleton thing is his religion, -- all
the more horrid, the grander its dress, that is not
worship, but mummery.<p>

2. If then to worship God is a duty, as we have
proved, it is a duty likewise to know God. This
supposes that God is knowable, a fact which it does
not lie within the province of this work to prove.
To an unknown God, all the worship we could
render would be to build Him an altar, without
priest, prayer, or sacrifice, and so leave Him in His
solitude. God is knowable by the <i>manifestation</i> of
His works (Rom. 1. 19); and where He is pleased
to speak, by the <i>revelation</i> of His word.  Apart from
revelation -- and, under a certain order of Providence,
God might have left us without revelation -- we
should study our Creator as He is made manifest in
the world around us, in the existence of perishable
things, in the order of the universe, in the region of
things eternally possible and knowable, in moral
truths, in the mental life and conscience of man.
Philosophy would be our guide in the search after
God. Men with less leisure or ability for speculation 
would acquiesce in the pronouncements of
philosophers on things divine; and, in the 
hypothesis which we are contemplating, Providence
would doubtless arrange for the better agreement
and harmony of philosophers among themselves.
Their trumpet would not send forth so uncertain a
blast, were that the instrument, in the counsels of
God, whereby the whole duty of religion was to be
regulated. As it is, we know better than philosophy
could teach us: for God hath spoken in His
Son. <p>
