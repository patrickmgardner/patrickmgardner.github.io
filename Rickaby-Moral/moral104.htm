<h1>Chapter IV: Of Passions.</h1>
<hr><p><h2>Section I. -- <i>Of Passions in General.</i></h2>

1. A PASSION is defined to be: <i>A movement of the
irrational part of the soul, affected by a notable alteration 
of the body, on the apprehension of good or evil</i>.
The soul is made up of intellect, will, and sensible
appetite. The first two are rational, the third
irrational: the third is the seat of the passions.
In a disembodied spirit, or an angel, there are no
senses, no sensible appetite, no passions. The
angel, or the departed soul, can love and hate, fear
and desire, rejoice and grieve, but these are not
passions in the pure spirit, they are acts of intellect
and will alone. So man also often loves and hates,
and does other acts that are synonymous with 
corresponding passions, and yet no passion is there.
The man is working with his calm reason: his
irrational soul is not stirred. To an author, when
he is in the humour for it, it is a delight to be
writing, but not a passionate delight. The will finds
satisfaction in the act: the irrational soul is not
affected by it. Or a penitent is sorry for his sin:
he sincerely regrets it before God: his will is
heartily turned away, and wishes that that sin had
never been. At the same time his eye is dry,
his features unmoved, not a sigh does he utter,
and yet he is truly sorry. It is important to
bear these facts in mind: else we shall be 
continually mistaking for passions what are pure acts
of will, or <i>vice versa</i>, misled by the identity of
name.<p>

2. The great mark of a passion is its sensible
working of itself out upon the body, -- what Dr. Bain
calls "the diffusive wave of emotion." Without
this mark there is no passion, but with it are other
mental states besides passions, as we define them.  
All strong emotion affects the body sensibly, but not
all emotions are passions. There are emotions that
arise from and appertain to the rational portion
of the soul. Such are Surprise, Laughter, Shame.
There is no sense of humour in any but rational
beings; and though dogs look ashamed and horses
betray curiosity, that is only inasmuch as in these
higher animals there is something analogous to what
is reason in man. Moreover passions are conversant
with good and evil affecting sense, but the objects
of such emotions as those just mentioned are not
good and evil as such, common parlance notwithstanding, 
whereby we are said to laugh at a <i>bon mot</i>,
or "a good thing."<p>

3. Love is a generic passion, having for its
species <i>desire</i> and <i>delight</i>, the contraries of which
are <i>abhorrence</i> and <i>pain</i>. Desire is of absent good;
abhorrence is of absent evil; delight is in present
good; pain is at present evil. The good and the evil
which is the object of any passion must be apprehended 
by sense, or by imagination in a sensible
way, whether itself be a thing of sense or not.<p>

4. Desire and abhorrence, delight and pain,
are conversant with good and evil simply.  But
good is often attainable only by an effort, and evil
avoidable by an effort.  The effort that good costs
to attain casts a shade of evil or undesirableness
over it: we may shrink from the effort while coveting
the good.  Again, the fact of evil being at all avoidable 
is a good thing about such evil. If we call
evil black, and good white, avoidable evil will be
black just silvering into grey: and arduous good
will be white with a cloud on it. And if the white
attracts, and the black repels the appetite, it appears
that arduous good is somewhat distasteful, to wit, to
the faint-hearted; and avoidable, or vincible, evil has
its attraction for the man of spirit. About these
two objects, good hard of getting and evil hard of
avoidance, arise four other passions, <i>hope</i> and <i>despair</i>
about the former, <i>fear</i> and <i>daring</i> about the latter.
Hope goes out towards a difficult good: despair flies
from it, the difficulty here being more repellent than
the good is attractive. Fear flies from a threatening
evil: while daring goes up to the same, drawn by
the likelihood of vanquishing it.  <i>Desire</i> and <i>abhorrence</i>, 
<i>delight</i> and <i>pain</i>, <i>hope</i> and <i>despair</i>, <i>fear</i> and
<i>daring</i>, with <i>anger</i> and <i>hatred</i> (of which presently),
complete our list of passions.<p>

5. Aristotle and his school of old, called Peripatetics, 
recommended the moderation of the
passions, not their extirpation. The Stoics on the
other hand contended that the model man, the sage,
should be totally devoid of passions.  This celebrated 
dispute turned largely on the two schools
not understanding the same thing by the word
<i>passion</i>.  Yet not entirely so.  There was a residue of
real difference, and it came to this. If the sensitive
appetite stirs at all, it must stir in one or other of
nine ways corresponding to the nine passions which
we have enumerated. Such an emotion as Laughter
affects the imagination and the sensitive part of
man, and of course the body visibly, but it does not
stir the sensitive appetite, since it does not prompt
to action. To say then that a man has no passions,
means that the sensitive appetite never stirs within
him, but is wholly dead. But this is impossible, as
the Stoic philosopher was fain to confess when
he got frightened in a storm at sea. Having no
passions cannot in any practical sense mean having
no movements of the sensitive appetite, for that will
be afoot of its own proper motion independent of
reason: but it may mean cherishing no passions,
allowing none to arise unresisted, but suppressing
their every movement to the utmost that the will can.
In that sense it is a very intelligible and practical
piece of advice, that the wise man should labour to
have no passions. It is the advice embodied in
Horace's <i>Nil admirari</i>, Talleyrand's "No zeal,"
Beaconsfield's "Beware of enthusiasm." It would
have man to work like a scientific instrument, calm as
a chronometer, regulated by reason alone. This was
the Stoic teaching, this the perfection that they
inculcated, quite a possible goal to make for, if not
to attain.  And it is worth a wise man's while to
consider, whether he should bend his efforts in this
direction or not.  The determination here taken and
acted upon will elaborate quite a different character
of man one way or the other. The effort made as
the Stoics direct, would mean no yielding to excitement, 
no poetry, no high-strung devotion, no rapture,
no ecstasy, no ardour of love, no earnest rhetoric
spoken or listened to, no mourning, no rejoicing
other than the most conventional, to the persistent
smothering of whatever is natural and really felt, no
tear of pity freely let flow, no touch of noble anger
responded to, no scudding before the breeze of
indignation, -- all this, that reason may keep on the
even tenour of her way undisturbed.<p>

6. The fault in this picture is that it is not the
picture of a man, but of a spirit.  He who being
man should try to realize it in himself, would fall
short of human perfection.  For though the sensitive 
appetite is distinguished from the will, and the
two may clash and come in conflict, yet they are not
two wholly independent powers, but the one man
is both will and sensitive appetite, and he rarely
operates according to one power without the other
being brought into corresponding play. There is a
similar concomitance of the operations of intellect
and imagination. What attracts the sensitive
appetite, commonly allures also the effective will,
though on advertence the elective will may reject it.  
On the other hand, a strong affection and election
of the will cannot be without the sensitive appetite
being stirred, and that so strongly that the motion is
notable in the body, -- in other words, is a passion.
Passion is the natural and in a certain degree the
inseparable adjunct of strong volition. To check
one is to check the other. Not only is the passion
repressed by repressing the volition, but the repression 
of the passion is also the repression of the
volition. A man then who did his best to repress
all movements of passion indiscriminately, would
lay fetters on his will, lamentable and cruel and
impolitic fetters, where his will was bent on any
object good and honourable and well-judged.<p>

7. Again, man's will is reached by two channels,
from above downwards and from below upwards: it
is reached through the reason and through the
imagination and senses. By the latter channel it
often receives evil impressions, undoubtedly, but
not unfrequently by the former also. Reason may
be inconsiderate, vain, haughty, mutinous, unduly
sceptical. The abuse is no justification for closing
either channel. Now the channel of the senses and
of the imagination is the wider, and in many cases
affords the better passage of the two. The will that
is hardly reached by reason, is approached and won
by a pathetic sight, a cry of enthusiasm, a threat
that sends a tremor through the limbs. Rather
I should say the affective will is approached in this
way: for it remains with the elective will, on 
advertence and consultation with reason, to decide
whether or not it shall be won to consent.  But
were it not for the channel of passion, this will could
never have been approached at all even by reasons
the most cogent. Rhetoric often succeeds, where
mere dry logic would have been thrown away.  God
help vast numbers of the human race, if their wills
were approachable only through their reasons! They
would indeed be fixtures.<p>

8. Another fact to notice is the liability of
reason's gaze to become morbid and as it were
inflamed by unremitting exercise. I do not here
allude to hard study, but to overcurious scanning
of the realities of this life, and the still greater
realities and more momentous possibilities of the
world to come. There is a sense of the surroundings
being too much for us, an alarm and a giddiness, that
comes of sober matter-of-fact thought over-much
prolonged. Then it happens that one or more
undeniable truths are laid hold of, and considered in
strong relief and in isolation from the rest: the result
is a distorted and partial view of truth as a whole,
and therewith the mind is troubled. Here the
kindlier passions, judiciously allowed to play, come
in to soothe the wound and soreness of pure intellect, 
too keen in its workings for one who is not yet
a pure spirit.<p>

9. Moral good and evil are predicable only of
<i>human acts</i>, in the technical sense of the term. (c. i.,
nn. 2-4, p. 1.) As the passions by definition (c. iv.,
s. i., n. 1, p. 41) are not human acts, they can never be
morally evil of themselves. But they are an occasion
of moral evil in this way. They often serve to wake
up the slumbering Reason. To that end it is
necessary that they should start up of themselves
without the call of Reason. This would be no
inconvenience, if the instant Reason awoke, and
adverted to the tumult and stir of Passion, she could
take command of it, and where she saw fit, quell it.
But Reason has no such command, except in cases
where she has acquired it by years of hard fighting.
Passion once afoot holds on her course against the
dictate of Reason. True, so long as it remains mere
Passion, and Reason is not dragged away by it, no
consent of the will given, no voluntary act elicited,
still less carried into outward effect, -- so long as
things remain thus, however Passion may rage,
there is no moral evil done.  But there is a great
temptation, and in great temptation many men fall.
The evil is the act of free will, but the pressure on
the will is the pressure of Passion. But Passion
happily is a young colt amenable to discipline.
Where the assaults of Passion are resolutely and
piously withstood, and the incentives thereto
avoided -- unnatural and unnecessary incentives I
mean -- Passion itself acquires a certain habit of
obedience to Reason, which habit is moral virtue.
Of that presently.<p>

10. In a man of confirmed habits of moral
virtue, Passion starts up indeed independently of
Reason, but then Reason ordinarily finds little 
difficulty in regulating the Passion so aroused. In a
certain high and extraordinary condition of human
nature, not only has Reason entire mastery over
Passion wherever she finds it astir, but Passion
cannot stir in the first instance, without Reason
calling upon it to do so. In this case the torpor of
the will deprecated above (n. 7) is not to be feared,
because Reason is so vigorous and so masterful as to
be adequate to range everywhere and meet all emergencies 
without the goad of Passion. This state is
called by divines the <i>state of integrity</i>. In it Adam
was before he sinned. It was lost at the Fall, and
has not been restored by the Redemption. It is not
a thing in any way due to human nature: nothing
truly natural to man was forfeited by Adam's sin.  
It is no point of holiness, no guerdon of victory,
this state of integrity, but rather a being borne On
angel's wings above the battle.  But one who has
no battle in his own breast against Passion, may yet
suffer and bleed and die under exterior persecution:
nay, he may, if he wills, let in Passion upon himself,
to fear and grieve, when he need not. So did the
Second Adam in the Garden of Gethsemane.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- Of Desire.</h2>

1. Desires are either <i>physical</i> cravings, by moderns
called <i>appetites</i>; or physical desires or <i>tastes</i>, called
<i>desires</i> proper.  The appetites have their beginning
in bodily uneasiness. They are felt needs of something 
required for the animal maintenance of the
individual or of the race. The objects of the
several appetites are Meat and Drink, Warmth or
Coolness, Exercise and Repose, Sleep, Sex. The
object of mere appetite is marked by quantity only,
not by quality. That is to say, the thing is sought
for in the vague, in a certain amount sufficient to
supply the want, but not this or that variety of the
thing. The cry of a hungry man is, "Give me to
eat," if very hungry, "Give me much:" but so far
as he is under the mere dominion of appetite he
does not crave any particular article of food, 
vegetable or animal: he wants quantity merely. So of
thirst, so of all the appetites, where there is nothing
else but appetite present.<p>

2. But if a thirsty man cries for champagne, or
a hungry man fancies a venison pasty, there is
another element beyond appetite in that demand.
On the matter of the physical craving there is
stamped the form of a psychical desire.  The
psychical element prescribes a quality of the objects
sought. The thirsty man thus prompted no longer
wants drink but wine: the man mewed up within
doors no longer calls for exercise, but for a horse or
a bicycle.  It is obvious that in man the appetites
generally pass into the further shape of psychical
desire.  It is when the appetite is vehement, or the
man is one who makes slight study of his animal
wants, that pure appetite, sheer physical craving, is
best shown. Darius flying before his conqueror is
ready to drink at any source, muddy or clear, a drink
is all that he wants: it is all that is wanted by
St. Paul the first Hermit. But your modern lounger
at the clubs, what variety of liquors are excogitated
to please his palate!<p>

3. Not all psychical desires are on the matter of
appetite; they may be fixed on any good whatsoever
of body or of mind.  Many psychical desires are
not passions at all, but reside exclusively in the
superior part of the soul, in the will prompted by
the understanding, and do not affect the body in any
sensible way. Such for instance is the great desire
of happiness. Those desires that are passions are
prompted, not by the understanding, but by the
imagination or fancy, imaging to itself some particular 
good, not good in general, for that the understanding 
contemplates.  Fancy paints the picture;
or if sense presents it, fancy appropriates and embellishes 
it: the sensitive appetite fastens upon the
representation: the bodily organs sensibly respond;
and there is the passion of psychical desire.<p>

4. <i>Physical cravings, or appetites, have limited objects:
the objects of psychical desires may be unlimited.</i>  A
thirsty man thirsts not for an ocean, but for drink
<i>quantum sufficit</i>: give him that and the appetite is
gone. But the miser covets all the money that
be can get: the voluptuary ranges land and sea in
search of a new pleasure: the philosopher ever longs
for a higher knowledge: the saint is indefatigable in
doing good. Whatever a man takes to be an end in
itself, not simply a means, that he desires without
end or measure. What he desires as a means, he
desires under a limitation, so far forth as it makes
for the end, so much and no more. As Aristotle
says of the processes of art, "the end in view is the
limit," <b>peras to telos</b> (cf. c. ii., s. iii., n. 3., p. 15).  
whatever is desired as an end in itself, is taken to
be a part of happiness, or to represent happiness.
Happiness and the object that gives happiness is
the one thing that man desires for itself, and desires
without end or measure.  Unfortunately he is often
mistaken in the choice of this object. He often
takes for an end what is properly only a means.
They "whose god is their belly," have made this
mistake in regard of the gratification of appetite.
It is not appetite proper that has led to this 
perversion, but psychical desire, or appetite inflamed
by the artificial stimulus of imagination. For one
who would be temperate, it is more important to
control his imagination than to trouble about his
appetite. Appetite exhausts itself, sometimes within.
the bounds of what is good for the subject, sometimes 
beyond them, but still within some bounds; but
there is no limit to the cravings bred of imagination.<p>

5. By this canon a man may try himself to discover 
whether or not a favourite amusement is gaining 
too much upon him. An amusement is properly
a means to the end, that a man may come away
from it better fitted to do the serious work of his
life. Pushed beyond a certain point, the amusement 
ceases to minister to this end. The wise man
drops it at that point. But if one knows not where
to stop: or if when stopped in spite of himself, he
is restless till he begin again, and never willingly
can forego any measure of the diversion that comes
within his reach, the means in that case has passed
into an end: he is enslaved to that amusement,
inasmuch as he will do anything and everything for
the sake of it.  Thus some men serve pleasure. and
other men money.<p>

6. Hence is apparent the folly of supposing that
crimes against property are preventible simply by
placing it within the power of all members of the
community easily to earn an honest livelihood, and
therewith the satisfaction of all their natural needs.
It is not merely to escape cold and hunger that men
turn to burglary or fraudulent dealing: it is more
for the gratification of a fancy, the satisfaction of
an inordinate desire. Great crimes are not committed 
"to keep the wolf from the door," but
because of the wolf in the heart, the overgrown
psychical desire, which is bred in many a well-nourished, 
warmly clad, comfortably housed, highly
educated citizen. There is a sin born of "fulness
of bread."<p>

<i>Readings</i>. -- St. Thos., 1a 2ae, q. 30, art. 3, in
corp.; <i>ib.</i>, q. 30, art. 4, in corp.; Ar., <i>Eth.</i>, III., xi.,
1-4: Ar., <i>Pol.</i>, I., ix., 13; <i>ib.</i>, III, vii., 11-13.<p>

N.B. -- The division of desires into <i>physical</i> and
<i>psychical</i> is first suggested by Plato, who (<i>Rep.</i> 558
D to 559 C) divides them as <i>necessary</i> and 
<i>unnecessary</i>.  Unnecessary desires he treats as evil.
What Plato calls a <i>necessary</i>, Aristotle calls a <i>physical</i>,
and St. Thomas a <i>natural</i> desire. Unfortunately,
Aristotle and St. Thomas had but one word for our
English two, <i>physical</i> and <i>natural</i>.  Desires that are
not physical, not natural nor necessary to man in
his animal capacity, may be highly natural and
becoming to man as he is a reasonable being, or
they may be highly unbecoming.  These psychical
desires, called by St. Thomas <i>not natural</i>, take in
at once the noblest and the basest aspirations of
humanity.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section III. -- <i>Of Delight</i>.</h2>

1. Delight like desire may be either physical or
psychical.  All that has been said above of desire
under this division applies also to delight, which is
the realization of desire. This division does not
altogether fall in with that into <i>sensual</i> delights and
<i>intellectual</i> delights. A professional wine-taster could
hardly be said to find intellectual delight in a
bottle of good Champagne, real <i>Veuve-Clicquot</i>: yet
certainly his is a psychical delight, no mere 
unsophisticated gratification of appetite.  Sensual
delights then are those delights which are founded
on the gratification of appetite, whether simple --
in which case the delight is physical -- or studied
and fancy-wrought appetite, the gratification of
which is psychical delight.  Intellectual delights on
the other hand are those that come of the exercise
of intellect, not unsupported by imagination, but
where appetite enters not at all, or only as a remote
adjunct, albeit the delight may turn upon some
sight or sound, as of music, or of a fine range of
hills. Or the object may be a thing of intellect,
pure and removed from sense as far as an object
of human contemplation can be, for instance, the
first elements of matter, freewill, the immensity of
God. The study of such objects yields a purer
intellectual delight than that of the preceding. But
this is a high ground and a keen upper air, where
few can tread and breathe.<p>

2. A man has more complacency in himself upon
attaining to some intellectual delight than upon a
sensual satisfaction: he is prouder to have solved a
problem than to have enjoyed his dinner. Also,
he would rather forego the capacity of sensual enjoy.
ment than that of intellectual pleasure; rather lose
his sense of taste than his science or his scholar-
ship, if he has any notable amount of either.
Again, put sensual delight in one scale, and in the
other the intellectual delight of honour, no worthy
specimen of a man will purchase the pleasure at
the price of honour. The disgrace attaching to
certain modes of enjoyment is sufficient to make
men shun them, very pleasant though they be to
sense. Again, sensual delight is a passing thing,
waxing and waning: but intellectual delight is steady,
grasped and held firmly as a whole. But sensual
delight comes more welcome of the two in this
that it removes a pre-existing uneasiness, as hunger,
weariness, nervous prostration, thus doing a medicinal 
office: whereas no such office attaches in the
essential nature of things to intellectual delight,
as that does not presuppose any uneasiness; and
though it may remove uneasiness, the removal is
difficult, because the uneasiness itself is an obstacle
to the intellectual effort that must be made to derive
any intellectual delight. Sensual enjoyment is the
cheaper physician, and ailing mortals mostly resort
to that door.<p>

3. "I will omit much usual declamation on the
dignity and capacity of our nature: the superiority
of the soul to the body, of the rational to the
animal part of our constitution ; upon the worthiness, 
refinement, and delicacy of some satisfactions,
or the meanness, grossness, and sensuality of others:
because I hold that pleasures differ in nothing but
in continuance and intensity." (Paley, <i>Moral Philosophy</i>, 
bk. i., c. vi.)<p>

In opposition to the above it is here laid down
that <i>delights do not differ in continuance and intensity
that is, in quantity, alone, but likewise in quality</i>, that
is, some are nobler, better, and more becoming a
man than others, and therefore preferable on other
grounds than those of mere continuance and intensity. 
I wish to show that the more pleasant
pleasure is not always the better pleasure; that
even the pleasure which is more durable, and
thereby more pleasant in the long run, is not the
better of the two simply as carrying the greater
<i>cumulus</i> of pleasure. If this is shown, it will follow
that pleasure is not identical with good; or that
pleasure is not happiness, not the last end of man.<p>

4. Delight comes of activity, not necessarily of
change, except so far as activity itself involves
change, as it always does in mortal man. Delight
sits upon activity, as the bloom upon youth. Bloom
is the natural sign of maturity; and the delight
that we come to take in doing a thing shows that
we are at least beginning to do it well: our activity
is approaching perfection. In this sense it is said
that <i>delight perfects activity</i>.  As the activity, so will be
the delight. But the activity will be as the power
of which it is an exercise. Powers like in kind
will supply like activities, and these again will yield
delights alike in kind. There is no difference of
quality in such delights, they differ in quantity
alone. Thus taste and smell are two senses:
the difference between them can hardly be called
one of kind: therefore the delights of smelling and
of tasting fall under one category. We may exchange 
so much small for an equal amount of taste
it is a mere matter of quantity. But between sight
and hearing on the one hand, and taste and smell
and touch on the other, there is a wider difference,
due to the fact that intellect allies itself more
readily to the operation of the two former senses.<p>

5. -- Widest of all differences is that between sense
and intellect. To explain this difference in full
belongs to psychology. Enough to say here that
the object of sense is always particular, bound up
in circumstances of present time and place, as this
horse: while the object of intellect is universal, as
horse simply. The human intellect never works
without the concurrence either of sense or of imagination, 
which is as it were sense at second hand.
As pure intellectual operation is never found in man,
so neither is pure intellectual delight, like that of an
angel. Still, as even in man sense and intellect
are two powers differing in kind, so must their
operations differ in kind, and the delights consequent 
upon those operations. Therefore, unless
Paley would have been willing to allow that the
rational and animal parts of our nature differ only
as <i>more</i> and <i>less</i> -- which is tantamount to avowing
that man is but a magnified brute -- he ought
not to have penned his celebrated utterance, that
pleasures differ only in continuance and intensity:
be should have admitted that they differ likewise
in kind; or in other words, that pleasures differ in
quality as well as in quantity.  The goodness of a
pleasure, then, is not the mere amount of it.  To
repeat St. Augustine's reflection on the drunken
Milanese: "It makes a difference what source a
man draws his delight from." [<i>Interest unde quis gaudeat</i>. 
(S. Aug., <i>Confess.</i>, vi., 6.)] As in man reason
is nobler than sense, preferable, and a better good
to its possessor -- for reason it is that makes him
man and raises him above the brute -- so the use
of the reason and the delight that comes thereof is
nobler, preferable, and a better good to him than
the pleasure that is of the mere operation of his
animal nature. A little of the nobler delight 
outweighs a vast volume of the baser: not that the
nobler is the pleasanter, but because it is the nobler.
Nor can it be pretended that the nobler prevails as
being the more durable, and thereby likely to prove
the pleasanter in the long run. The nobler is better
at the time and in itself, because it is the more
human delight and characteristic of the higher
species.  I have but to add that what is better in
itself is not better under all circumstances. The
best life of man can only be lived at intervals.
The lower operations and the delights that go with
them have a medicinal power to restore the vigour
that has become enfeebled by a lengthened exercise
of the higher faculties. At those "dead points
food and fiddling are better than philosophy.<p>

6. This medicinal or restorative virtue of delight
is a fact to bear in mind in debating the question
how far it is right to act for the pleasure that the
action gives.  It is certainly wrong to act for mere
animal gratification. Such gratification is a stimulus
to us to do that which makes for the well-being of
our nature: to fling away all intention of any good
other than the delight of the action, is to mistake
the incentive for the end proposed. But this is a
doctrine easily misunderstood. An example may
save it from being construed too rigidly. Suppose a
man has a vinery, and being fond of fruit he goes
there occasionally, and eats, not for hunger, but
as he says, because he likes grapes. He seems to
act for mere pleasure: yet who shall be stern
enough to condemn him, so that he exceed not in
quantity? If he returns from the vinery in a more
amiable and charitable mood, more satisfied with
Providence, more apt to converse with men and do
his work in the commonwealth, who can deny that
in acting in view of these ends, at least implicitly,
he has taken lawful means to a proper purpose?
He has not been fed, but recreated: be has not
taken nourishment, but medicine, preventive or
remedial, to a mind diseased. It is no doubt a
sweet and agreeable medicine: this very agreeableness 
makes its medical virtue.  It is a sweet antidote 
to the bitterness of life. But though a man
may live by medicine, he does not live for it. So
no man by rights lives for pleasure. The pleasure
that a man finds in his work encourages him to
go on with it. The pleasure that a man finds by
turning aside to what is not work, picks him up,
rests and renovates him, that he may go forth as
from a wayside inn, or <i>diverticulum</i>, refreshed to
resume the road of labour. Hence we gather the
solution of the question as to the lawfulness of
acting for pleasure. If a man does a thing because
it is pleasant, and takes the pleasure as an incentive
to carry on his labour, or as a remedy to enable
him to resume it, he acts for pleasure rightly. For
this it is not necessary that he should expressly think
of the pleasure as being helpful to labour: it is
enough that he accepts the subordination of pleasure
to work as nature has ordained it; and this ordinance 
he does accept, if he puts forth no positive
volition the other way, whether expressly, as none
but a wrong-headed theologian is likely to do, or
virtually, by taking his pleasure with such greediness 
that the motion of his will is all spent therein
as in its last end and terminus, so that the pleasure
ceases to be referable to aught beyond itself, a case
of much easier occurrence. Or lastly, the natural
subordination of pleasure to work may be set aside,
defeated, and rendered impossible by the whole
tenour of an individual's life, if he be one of those
giddy butterflies who flit from pleasure to pleasure
and do no work at all. Till late in the morning he
sleeps, then breakfasts, then he shoots, lunches,
rides, bathes, dines, listens to music, smokes, and
reads fiction till late at night, then sleeps again;
and this, or the like of this is his day, some three
hundred days at least in the year, This is not
mere acting for pleasure, it is living for pleasure,
or acting for pleasure so continuously as to leave
no scope for any further end of life. It may be
hard to indicate the precise hour in which this
man's pleasure-seeking passes into sin still this is
clear, his life is not innocent. Clear him of gluttony
and lust, there remains upon him the sin of sloth
and of a wasted existence.<p>

7. Even the very highest of delights, the delight
of contemplation, is not the highest of goods, but
a concomitant of the highest good. The highest
good is the final object of the will: but the object
of the will is not the will's own act: we do not will
willing, as neither do we understand understanding --
not at least without a reflex effort. What we will
in contemplating is, not to be delighted, but to
see. This is the subjective end and happiness of
man, to see, to contemplate. Delight is not anything 
objective: neither is it the subjective last end
of humanity. In no sense then is delight, or
pleasure, the highest good.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section IV. -- <i>Of Anger</i>.</h2>

1. Anger is a compound passion, made up of
displeasure, desire, and hope: displeasure at a
slight received, desire of revenge and satisfaction
and hope of getting the same, the getting of it being
a matter of some difficulty and calling for some
exertion, for we are not angry with one who lies
wholly in our power, or whom we despise. Anger then
is conversant at once with the good of vengeance
and with the evil of a slight received: the good
being somewhat difficult to compass, and the evil
not altogether easy to wipe out. (Cf. s. i., n. 4, p. 43.)<p>

2. Anger is defined: <i>A desire of open vengeance
for an open slight, attended with displeasure at the same,
the slight being put upon self, or upon some dear one,
unbefittingly</i>. The vengeance that the angry man
craves is a vengeance that all shall see. "No, ye
unnatural hags," cries Lear in his fury, "I will do
such things, -- what they shall be yet I know not,
but they shall be the terror of the earth." When we
are angry, we talk of "making an example" of the
offender. The idea is that, as all the world has
seen us slighted and set at naught, so all the world,
witnessing the punishment of the offending party,
may take to heart the lesson which we are enforcing
upon him, namely, that we are men of might and
importance whom none should despise. Whoever
is angry, is angry at being despised, flouted to his
face and set at naught, either in his own person, or
in the person of one whom he venerates and loves,
or in some cause that lies near to his heart. Anger
is essentially a craving for vengeance on account of
a wrong done. If then we have suffered, but think
we deserve to suffer, we are not angry. If we have
suffered wrong, but the wrong seems to have been
done in ignorance, or in the heat of passion, we are
not angry, or we are not so very angry.	"If he
had known what he was about," we say, or, if he
had been in his right mind, he could not have
brought himself to treat me so." But when one
has done us cool and deliberate wrong, then we are
angry, because the slight is most considerable.
There is an appearance of our claims to considerations 
having been weighed, and found wanting.
We call it, "a cool piece of impertinence," "spiteful
malevolence," and the like. Any other motive to
which the wrong is traceable on the part of the
wrong-doer, lessens our anger against him: but the
motive of contempt, and that alone, if we seem to
discover it in him, invariably increases it. To this
all other points are reducible that move our anger,
as forgetfulness, rudely delivered tidings of 
misfortune, a face of mirth looking on at our distress,
or getting in the way and thwarting our purpose.<p>

3. Anger differs from hatred. Hatred is a chronic
affection, anger an acute one. Hatred wishes evil
to a man as it is evil, anger as it is just. Anger
wishes evil to fall on its object in the sight of all
men, and with the full consciousness of the sufferer:
hatred is satisfied with even a secret mischief, and,
so that the evil be a grievous one, does not much
mind whether the sufferer be conscious of it or no.
Thus an angry man may wish to see him who has
offended brought to public confession and shame:
but a hater is well content to see his enemy spending
his fortune foolishly, or dead drunk in a ditch on
a lonely wayside. The man in anger feels grief and
annoyance, not so the hater. At a certain point of
suffering anger stops, and is appeased when full
satisfaction seems to have been made: but an
enemy is implacable and insatiate in his desire of
your harm. St. Augustine in his Rule to his brethren
says: For quarrels, either have them not, or end
them with all speed, lest anger grow to hatred, and
of a mote make a beam."<p>

4. Anger, like vengeance, is then only a safe
course to enter on, when it proceeds not upon
personal but upon public grounds. And even by
this maxim many deceive themselves.<p>
