<h1>Chapter IV. Of Charity.</h1>

1. IT is the difference between sensible apprehension
and intellectual knowledge, that the former seizes
upon a particular object and it only, as <i>this sweet</i>:
the latter takes its object as the type of a class of
similars, <i>this and the like of this, this sweet as one of
the class of sweet things</i>. In like manner the love of
passion, which is the love of sense, regards one sole
object.  Titius is in love with Bertha alone, not
with woman in general. But an intellectual love
is the love of a type of beauty or goodness, of this
object and of others as they approach in likeness
to it. Whoever loves William from an intellectual
appreciation of his patriotism, in loving him loves
all patriots. Every animal loves itself with a brute,
sensible love, not a love to find fault with, nor yet
a noble and exalted sentiment -- a love purely 
self-regarding, quite apart from the good that is in self,
but embracing self simply as self, and self alone.
This is the first love of self even in man.  But over
and above this animal and sensible love, which no
man lacks, there is in all men worthy of the name
a second self-regarding affection of an intellectual
cast, whereby a man loves himself as discerning
with the eye of his soul the excellence of his own
nature -- "how noble in reason, how infinite in
faculty, in form and moving how express and
admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension 
how like a god, the beauty of the world,
the paragon of animals." Intellectual self-complacence 
overflows from self to similars.  It is not
self-love, it is love of the race, "the milk of human
kindness," philanthropy.<p>

2. But man is a disappointing creature, after all,
a mere "quintessence of dust," unless he can rise
above himself by relation with some superhuman
being, and make his final fortune in some better
region than this world.  Reason requires that we
love ourselves, and love our fellow-men, for and in
order to the development of the highest gifts and
capacities that are in us. These are gifts and
capacities divine, preparing us to find our everlasting 
happiness in God. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. ii., s. iv., n. 2, p. 22.)
The love that we bear to ourselves and our neighbour, 
in view of our coming from God and
going to God, is called the love of <i>charity</i>. Charity
differs from philanthropy in looking beyond the
present life, and above creatures. A materialist
and atheist may possess philanthropy, but not
charity.<p>

3. Beside the twofold love, animal and intellectual, 
which we bear ourselves, we may also and
should love ourselves with the love of charity, seeing
God's gifts in us, and desiring the perfection of
those gifts in a happy eternity occupied with God.  
The charity which we should thus bear to ourselves
is the model of that which we owe to our neighbour,
whom we are to love as ourselves, not with the same
intensity, but with the same quality of love, wishing
him the good, human and divine, temporal and
eternal, which we wish for ourselves, though not so
earnestly as we wish it for ourselves. Our love for
ourselves is stronger than for our neighbour: for, if
love comes of likeness, much more does it come of
identity. But by reason of the vast preponderance
of the good that is rational and eternal over that
which is material and temporal; and also by reason
of the principle laid down by St. Thomas, that
"as to the sharing together of (eternal) happiness,
greater is the union of our neighbour's soul with
our soul than even of our own body with our soul"
(2a 2ae, q. 26, art. 5, ad 2), -- we are bound to
love our neighbour's eternal good better than our
own temporal good, and in certain special conjunctures 
to sacrifice the latter to the former. We have
no duty and obligation of loving his temporal good
above our own temporal good. But it is often
matter of commendation and counsel to sacrifice
our temporal interest to our neighbour's.  This
sacrifice is no breach of the order of charity, 
beginning at home: since what is resigned of material
and perishable profit is gained in moral perfection.  
Especially commendable is the surrender of private
good for the good of the community. Charity, or
philanthropy, taking this form, bears the name of
patriotism and public spirit.<p>

4. Charity, like material forces, acts in a certain
inverse ratio to the distance of the object. Other
considerations being equal, the nearer, the dearer.
Nay, nearness and likeness to ourselves goes further
than goodness in winning our love.  This is natural,
and charity presupposes nature, and follows its
order.  As we have more charity for ourselves than
for others whom we acknowledge to be better men,
so likewise for our kinsmen and intimate friends.  
We may put the matter thus.  Charity consists in
wishing and seeking to procure for a person the
good that leads to God. One element is the
intensity and eagerness of this wish and search;
another is the greatness of the good wished.  Now
we wish those who are better than ourselves to be
rewarded according to their deserts with a greater
good than ourselves: but this wish is but lukewarm
compared to the intensity of our desire that we and
our friends with us may attain to all the good that
we are capable of.<p>

5. The Christian precept to love our enemies is
merely the enforcement of a natural obligation.  The
obligation stands almost self-evident as soon as it
is cleared of misunderstanding. The love of enemies
is not based on the ground of their being hostile
and annoying us. It would be highly unnatural to
love them on that score. Nor are we in duty bound
to show to one who hates us special offices of friendship, 
except we find him in extreme need, e.g., dying
in a ditch, as the Good Samaritan found the Jew:
otherwise it is enough that we be animated towards
him with that common charity, which we bear to
other men who are not further off from us than he
is. If Lucius offend Titius, there being no other
tie between them than the tie of friendship, Titius
may, where the offence is very outrageous, henceforth 
treat Lucius as a stranger. The question of
scandal has sometimes to be regarded, but that is
an extrinsic circumstance to our present subject.
Nor are we concerned to say what is the better
thing for Titius to do, but to say all that he is
bound to do. He is bound to render himself as
void of wilful malice, and as full of ordinary courtesy
and good feeling towards Lucius, as he is in the
case of Sempronius, a man whom he never heard of
till this day. But if there be some other antecedent
tie between them besides the tie of friendship, -- for
instance, if Titius and Lucius are two monks of the
same convent, two officers in the same regiment, two
partners of one firm, -- Titius is no longer justified
in treating Lucius as a stranger. He must regard
him with ordinary charity; now ordinary charity
between two brother-officers, or two fellow-monks,
is not the same as between men who have no such
tie one with another. This is why we laid it down
that we must be animated towards him who has
offended us "with that common charity, which we
bear to other men who are not further off from us
than he is."<p>

6. This then being the exact obligation, the
same is easily established. We must love our
enemies, because the reasons given for loving all.
mankind (nn. 1, 2) are not vitiated by this or that
man having treated us shamefully. The human
nature in him still remains good actually, and still
more, potentially; and if good and hopeful, to that
extent also lovable. Nor is this lovableness a mere
separable accident. Rather, it is the offensive 
behaviour of the man that is the separable accident.
At that we may well be disgusted and abominate it.
But the underlying substance remains good, not
incurably tainted with that vicious accident. We
must attend to the substance, which is, rather than
to the accident, which <i>happens</i>, and may be 
abolished. Let us endeavour to abolish the accident,
still so that we respect and regard the substance.
Let us seek for redress under the guidance of
prudence according to the circumstances of the
case, but not for the ruin of our enemy. Let us
not render evil for evil, but even in exacting a just
satisfaction, make it of the nature of that compensatory 
evil, which is by consequence good. Let us
<i>be angry</i> with our enemy, but <i>sin not</i> by hating him.
(<i>Ethics</i>, c. iv., s. iv., n. 3.) We may seek 
satisfaction for any <i>wrong</i> we have suffered: in grave
cases we must have recourse to the State for that
but the sin, if any, of our adversary is not our
concern to punish or to seek vengeance for. (<i>Ethics</i>,
c. ix., s. iii., n. 4.)<p>

7. The same reasoning holds good even of <i>public
enemies</i>, tyrants, persecutors, anarchists, assassins.  
We must include them in our prayers, wish for
their conversion, and, though their case appear
hopeless, we must not damn them before their
time. If we found one of them dying by accident
of cold or asphyxia, we should be bound by a grave
obligation to use all ordinary efforts to bring him
round and recover him. Still we may use our best
efforts to bring them to justice, even to capital
punishment, according to the procedure of public
law established in the country, and not otherwise.
We may also with an <i>inefficacious</i> desire, that is, a
desire that finds no vent in action, desire their
death under an alternative thus, that either living
they may cease to do evil, or that God may call
them away to where the wicked cease from troubling. 
But we must not desire, nor be glad of, their
death by any unlawful means, for that were to 
sympathise with crime.<p>

8. Real charity shows itself in action, succouring 
neighbour in need, which is sometimes a counsel,
sometimes a duty. It is an axiom, that <i>charity is
not binding with grave inconvenience</i>. The gravity of
the inconvenience in prospect must be measured
against the urgency of the need to be relieved. A
neighbour is technically said to be in <i>extreme need</i>,
when he is in imminent peril of deadly evil to soul
or body, and is unable to help himself.  We are
under severe obligation of charity to succour any
whom we find in this plight.<p>

9. By charity we give of our own to another: by
justice we render to another that which is his.
Charity neglected calls for no restitution, when
the need that required it is past away: justice
violated cries for restitution, for what we have
taken away from our neighbour remains still his.
The obligations of justice are negative, except for
the fulfilment of contracts: obligations in charity
are largely positive. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. v., s. ix., n. 7, p. 108.)<p>
