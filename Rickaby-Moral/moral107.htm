<h1>Chapter VII: Of the Eternal Law. </h1>

1. A LAW is defined to be: <i>A precept just and
abiding, given for promulgation to a perfect 
community</i>.  A law is primarily a rule of action.  The
first attribute of a law is that it be just: just to
the subject on whom it is imposed, as being no
harmful abridgment of his rights: just also to
other men, as not moving him to injustice against
them.  An unjust law is no law at all, for it is
not a rule of action. Still, we may sometimes
be bound, when only our own rights are infringed,
to submit to such an imposition, not as a law,
for it is none, but on the score of prudence, to
escape direr evils.  A law is no fleeting, occasional
rule of conduct, suited to meet some passing emergency 
or superficial disturbance.  The reason of a
law lies deep down, lasting and widespread in the
nature of the governed. A law, then, has these two
further attributes of permanence in duration and
amplitude in area.  Every law is made for all time,
and lives on with the life of the community for whom
it is enacted, for ever, unless it be either expressly
or implicitly repealed. A law in a community is like
a habit in an individual, an accretion to nature,
which abides as part of the natural being, and guides
henceforth the course of natural action. This
analog holds especially of those laws, which are not
enacted all of a sudden -- and such are rarely the
best laws -- but grow upon the people with gradual
growth unmarked, like a habit by the repetition of
acts, in the way of immemorial custom.  I have said
that a law is for a community, that it requires 
amplitude and large area.  A law is not laid down for an
individual, except so far as his action is of importance
to the community.  The private concerns of one
man do not afford scope and room enough for a law.  
Neither do the domestic affairs of one family.  A
father is not a legislator. A law aims at a deep,
far-reaching, primary good.  But the private good
of an individual, and the domestic good of a family,
are not primary goods, inasmuch as the individual
and the family are not primary but subordinate
beings: not complete and independent, but dependent 
and partial; not wholes but parts. The individual 
is part of the family, and the family is part of
a higher community. It is only when we are come
to some community which is not part of any higher,
that we have found the being, the good of which is
primary good, the aim of law. Such a community,
not being part of any further community in the same
order, is in its own order a perfect community.
Thus, in the temporal order, the individual is part of
the State.  The State is a perfect community; and
the good of the State is of more consequence than
the temporal well-being of any individual citizen.  
The temporal good of the individual, then, is matter
of law, in so far as it is lent to the good of
the State. We have, then, to hold that a law is
given to the members of a perfect community for the
good of the whole. Not every precept, therefore, is
a law: nor every superior a lawgiver: for it is not
every superior that has charge of the good of a
perfect community. Many a precept is given to an
individual, either for his private good, as when a
father commands his child, or for the private good
of him that issues the precept, as when a master
commands a servant. But every law is a precept:
for a law is an imperative rule of action, in view of
a good that is necessary, at least with the necessity
of convenience.  To every law there are counsels
attached.  A law may be said to be a <i>nucleus</i> of precept, 
having an <i>envelope</i> of counsel.  Every law has
also a pendent called punishment for those who
break it: this is called the sanction of the law. A law
is also for promulgation, as a birch rod for application.
The promulgation, or application, brings the law
home to the subject, but is not part of the law itself.
So much for the definition of Law.<p>

2. We have to learn to look upon the whole
created universe, and the fulness thereof, angels,
men, earth, sun, planets, fixed stars, all things visible
and invisible, as one great and perfect community,
whose King and Lawgiver is God. He is King,
because He is Creator and Lord. But lordship and
kingship are different things, even in God. It is one
thing to be lord and master, owner and proprietor of
a chattel, property and domain: it is another thing
to be king and governor, lawgiver and judge of
political subjects.  The former is called <i>power of
dominion</i>, or right of ownership, the latter is <i>power of
jurisdiction</i>.  Power of dominion is for the good of
him who wields it: but power of jurisdiction is for
the good of the governed. As God is Lord of the
universe, He directs all its operations to His own
glory. As He is King, He governs as a king should
govern, for the good of His subjects. In intellectual
creatures, whose will is not set in opposition to God,
the subject's good and the glory of the Lord finally
coincide.  God's power of dominion is the concern
of theologians: the moralist is taken up with His
power of jurisdiction, from whence emanates the
moral law.<p>

3. In the last chapter (s. ii., nn. 9, 10, p. 120,121),
we stated the moral law in these terms, that <i>God
wills to bind His creatures to certain lines of action</i>, not
arbitrary lines, as we saw, but the natural lines of
each creature's being.  The law thus stated takes in
manifestly a wider field than that of moral action.
There is in fact no action of created things that is
not comprehended under this statement. It comprises 
the laws of physical nature and the action of
physical causes, no less than the moral law and
human acts. It is the one primeval law of the
universe, antecedent to all actual creation, and 
co-eternal with God.  And yet not necessary as God:
for had God not decreed from all eternity to create -- 
and He need not have decreed it -- neither would
He have passed in His own Divine Mind this second
decree, necessarily consequent as it is upon the
decree of creation, namely, that every creature
should act in the mode of action proper of its kind
This decree, supervening from eternity upon the
creative decree, is called the Eternal Law.<p>

4. This law does not govern the acts of God
Himself.  God ever does what is wise and good, not
because He binds Himself by the decree of His own
will so to act, but because of His all-perfect nature.
His own decrees have not for Him the force of a
precept: that is impossible in any case: yet He
cannot act against them, as His nature allows not of
irresolution, change of mind, and inconsistency.<p>

5. Emanating from the will of God, and resting
upon the nature of the creature, it would seem that
the Eternal Law must be irresistible.  " Who resisteth 
His will?" asks the Apostle. (Rom. ix. 19.)
" The streams of sacred rivers are flowing upwards,
and justice and the universal order is wrenched
back." (Euripides, <i>Medea</i>, 499.) It is only the 
perversion spoken of by the poet, that can anywise
supply the instance asked for by the Apostle.  The
thing is impossible in the physical order.  The
rivers cannot flow upwards, under the conditions
under which rivers usually flow: but justice and
purity, truth and religion may be wrenched back, in
violation of nature and of the law eternal.  The one
thing that breaks this law is sin. Sin alone is properly 
unnatural. The world is full of physical evils,
pain, famine, blindness, disease, decay and death.  
But herein is nothing against nature: the several
agents act up to their nature, so far as it goes: it is
the defect of nature that makes the evil.  But sin is
no mere shortcoming: it is a turning round and
going against nature, as though the July sun should
freeze a man, or the summer air suffocate him.  
Physical evil comes by the defect of nature, and by
permission of the Eternal Law.  But the moral evil
of sin is a breach of that law.<p>

6. A great point with modern thinkers is the
inviolability of the laws of physical nature, e.g., of
gravitation or of electrical induction. If these laws
are represented, as J. S. Mill said they should be, as
tendencies only, they are truly inviolable.  The law of
gravitation is equally fulfilled in a falling body, in a
body suspended by a string, and in a body borne up
by the ministry of an angel. There is no law of
nature to the effect that a supernatural force shall
never intervene.  Even if, as may be done perhaps
in the greatest miracles, God suspends His concurrence, 
so that the creature acts not at all, even
that would be no violation of the physical law of
the creature's action: for all that such a law provides
is, that the creature, if it acts at all, shall act in a
certain way, not that God shall always give the 
concurrence which is the necessary condition of its
acting at all.  The laws of physical nature then
are, strictly speaking, never violated, although the
course of nature is occasionally altered by supernatural 
interference, and continually by free human
volition.  But the laws of physical nature, in the
highest generality, are identified with the moral law.  
The one Eternal Law embraces all the laws of
creation.  It has a physical and a moral side.  On
the former it <i>effects</i>, on the latter it <i>obliges</i>, but on
both sides it is imperative; and though in moral
matters it be temporarily defeated by sin, still the
moral behest must in the end be fulfilled as surely as
the physical behest. The defeat of the law must
be made good, the sin must be punished. of the
Eternal Law working itself out in the form of punishment, 
we shall speak presently.<p>

7. It is important to hold this conception of the
Eternal Law as embracing physical nature along
with rational agents.  To confine the law, as modern
writers do, to rational agents alone, is sadly to
abridge the view of its binding force.  The rigid
application of physical laws is brought home to us
daily by science and by experience: it is a point
gained, to come to understand that the moral
law being intimately one with those physical laws,
is no less absolute and indefeasible, though in a
different manner, than they.<p>

It is hard for us to conceive of laws being given to
senseless things. We cannot ourselves prescribe to
iron or to sulphur the manner of its action. As
Bacon says (<i>Novum Organum</i>, i., Aphorism 4) "Man
can only put natural bodies together or asunder;
nature does the rest within." That is, man cannot
make the laws of nature: he can only arrange collocations 
of materials so as to avail himself of those
laws. But God makes the law, issuing His command, 
the warrant without which no creature could
do anything, that every creature, rational and
irrational, shall act each according to its kind or
nature. Such is the Eternal Law.<p>
