<h1>Chapter VII.  Of Property.</h1>

<hr><p><h2>Section I. -- <i>Of Private Property</i>.</h2>

1. PROPERTY was called by the Romans <i>res 
familiaris</i>, the stuff and substance of the family.
Property may be held by the individual for himself
alone: but any large accumulation of it is commonly
held by the head of a family, actual or potential,
for the family; and he cherishes it for the sake of
his family as much as, or even more than, for his
own sake. This is to be borne in mind, for many
errors in theory and in practice spring from a large
proprietor figuring as an individual, and not as a
sort of <i>corporation sole</i> in his capacity of 
pater-familias.<p>

2. We have seen (c. v., s. i., n. 2, p. 245) how
man acquires a right over external goods, as it were
setting the seal of his own personality upon them.
It appears upon further consideration, that this
right must extend beyond the mere making things
your own for immediate use and consumption; it
must extend to the storing of things for future and
perennial use. Otherwise we have Communism.
Communism allows men to hold property 
collectively in a common stock, and allows each
member of the community to take for his peculiar
own out of that stock whatever for the moment he
needs; but it will not permit him to appropriate
private means of subsistence against any notable
time to come.  Communism is very good in a family,
which is an imperfect community, part of a higher
community, the State. It is very good in a
monastery, which is like a family: again, very
good in the primitive Church at Jerusalem, which
existed for the time on quasi-monastic lines: very
good even in a perfect community, if such there be,
of tropical savages, for whom nature supplies all
things, bananas to eat and palm-leaves to wear,
without any human labour of production; but
very bad and quite unworkable everywhere else.  
St. Thomas, following Aristotle, puts it pithily
and sufficiently: "Private property is necessary to
human life for three reasons: first, because every
one is more careful to look after what belongs to
himself alone than after what is common to all or to
many, since all men shun labour and leave to others
what is matter of joint concern, as happens where
there are too many servants: on another ground,
because human affairs are more orderly handled,
if on each individual there rests his own care
of managing something, whereas there would be
nothing but confusion, if every one without 
distinction were to have the disposal of any thing
he chose to take in hand: thirdly, because by this
means society is the rather kept at peace, every
member being content with his own possession,
whence we see that among those who hold any
thing in common and undivided ownership strifes
not unfrequently arise." (2a 2ae, q. 66, art. 2, in
corp.)<p>

3. If any revolutionist yet will have the hardihood 
to say with Proudhon, "Property is theft," we
shall ask him, "From whom?" He will answer of
course, "From the community." But that answer
supposes the community to have flourished, a
wealthy corporation, before private property began.  
Needless to say that history knows nothing of such
a corporation. The saying, that <i>in the beginning all
things were in common</i>, is not true in the sense that
they were <i>positively</i> in common, like the goods of
a corporation, which are collective property: but
simply that they were <i>negatively</i> in common, that
is, not property at all, neither of corporation nor of
individual, but left in the middle open to all comers,
for each to convert into property by his occupation,
and by his labour to enhance and multiply. This
must be modified by the observation, that the first
occupants were frequently heads of families, or of
small clans, and occupied and held for themselves
and their people.<p>

4. The saying, that <i>all things are in common by the
law of nature</i>, must be received with still greater
reserve. Really with as much truth it might be said
that all men are unmarried, or unclad, or uneducated,
by the law of nature. Nature unaided by human
volition provides neither property, nor clothing, nor
marriage, nor education, for man. But nature bids,
urges and requires man to bestir his voluntary
energies for the securing of all these things. The
law of nature does not prescribe this or that
particular distribution of goods, as neither does it
join this man with that woman in marriage, nor
insist on plaids rather than coats, nor set all boys
to learn algebra, nor fix a ritual for divine worship;
but it insists in the vague upon some worship, some
education, some clothing, some marriage, and some
distribution of goods, leaving the determination in
each case to choice, custom, and positive law,
human and divine.<p>

5. All property that can ever be immediately
serviceable for saving human life, is held under this
burden, that a perishing fellow-creature, who cannot
otherwise help himself in a case of extreme need (c. iv.,
n. 8, p. 243), may make such use of the property of
another as shall suffice to rescue him from perishing
off-hand. If he draws largely on another for this
purpose, he ought to make compensation afterwards, 
if he has the means. This has been taken for
a piece of the primeval rock of Communism cropping
up from underneath subsequent human formations, --
quite a mistaken notion. There is no Communism
whatever in the transaction. Up to the instant
when the needy man seizes the article that he
requires to save him from death, that article still
belongs to the owner from whom he takes it, who
is bound in charity to give it to the needy party, but
not in justice. Extreme need does not confer ownership, 
nor dispossess any previous owner: but it
confers the right of taking what is another's as
though it belonged to no one; and in the taking,
the thing passes into the ownership of the new
occupant, so that for the previous owner forcibly to
resume it would be a violation of justice. English
law does not recognise this right -- properly enough,
for with us it would be made a plea for much stealing --
but refers the destitute to the parish. The law
is considerately worked by the magistrates. A
starving man, who took a loaf off a baker's tray,
has been known to be sentenced to a few hours'
imprisonment with two good meals.<p>

6. As St. Paul says (2 Cor. xii. 14), "parents
ought to lay up for their children," that they in
whom their own existence is continued, may not be
left unprovided for at their decease. The amount
laid up necessary for this purpose, ought not to be
diverted from it. Thus much at least Natural Law
can tell us of the right of inheritance. And 
concerning testamentary right these natural considerations 
are forthcoming, that it adds to the desirability
of property, that it secures deference to the wealthy
in their old age, and that the abolition of it might
be frustrated by an apparatus of confidential <i>donationes 
inter vivos</i>, that is to say, making the property
over in trust before death. Further enlargement of
the natural basis of testamentary right may be
effected by the judicious reader.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- <i>Of Private Capital</i>.</h2>

1. Reverting to a former section (c. v., s. v., nn.
1-5, p. 255) we lay down this distinction: Goods held
for their <i>use value</i> are <i>consumer's wealth</i>: goods held
for their <i>market value</i> are <i>producer's wealth</i>, otherwise
called <i>capital</i>. Capital then is that wealth which
a man holds for the purpose of gaining further
wealth by means of commercial exchange. It is
represented by the razors that are made, not to mow
the manly beard, or youthful moustache, of the
maker, but, as the Yorkshire vendor put it, "to
sell."<p>

2. Those economists who would allow no private
ownership of capital, but would have all capital to
be State property, are called Socialists.  They stand
distinctly apart from the Communists, whom we
have been labouring to refute in the last section.
The Communist forbids all private property: the
Socialist allows private property, but in the shape
of <i>consumer's wealth</i> alone. The Communist ignores
the necessity of labour: the Socialist schemes to
make all men work. The Communist contemplates
a hand-to-mouth dispensation of all things: the
Socialist locks all things up, wages in private coffers,
capital in government stores. The Communist is a
madman: the speculations of the Socialist are some.
times deep.<p>

3. To what are we to attribute the rise of
Socialism, and its growth and propagation so fast
and vigorous, that, its supporters say with some
colour of evidence, it is a theory destined within a
measurable space of time to pass into actual
practice, whether men will or no? The cause is
not far to seek. There has lighted a plague upon
all civilized countries, an outbreak fearful and
severe: only by the great blessing of Providence,
joined to drastic remedial measures on our part, can
we cope with the evil.  The plague is a cancerous
formation of luxury growing out of a root of
pauperism.  It is a disease old as the world, but
the increase of commerce and intercommunication
has occasioned its bursting upon our generation in
a peculiarly virulent form. And what is more, ours
being a talking age, the disease is made the staple of
speeches infinite, and the masses are clamouring for
a remedy.  The remedy proposed is Socialism.<p>

4. Socialism in its essence is an attempt to
transfer to the State, governed by universal suffrage,
the wealth, and with the wealth the social duties
of what have hitherto been the wealthy and governing 
classes. It is not enough for the multitude that
they are getting the political power out of the hands
of the landlord and the capitalist: they envy the
one his broad acres, and the other his investments.  
All must be theirs, sovereignty and wealth alike. If
wealth has its duties, the people collectively with
cheerful acceptance will undertake those duties.
'It shall be ours, not only to be king, but to be
employer, patron, landlord, educator. We will
assign to the workman his wages, just and ample
and perennial: we will adjust production to demand:
we will be the restorers of agriculture: we will
monopolise the carrying-trade: we alone will sell
whatever shall be sold: we will wash the workman
in public baths: his taste shall be elevated by our
statues and pictures, our theatres, our music-halls,
and our churches; we will gratify his curiosity with
our news-agencies, feed his thought with our popular
philosophy, educate his children as our own in our
primary and secondary schools. Furthermore, we
will provide the long desiderated career open to
talents. The stupid boy, though his father was
our Prime Minister, shall be made a cabin-boy, or
a scavenger's assistant, an awful example to young
gentlemen who fail to pass the Government examinations: 
while we will pick up, not the gutter
child, for there shall be no more children in gutters,
but the son of the woman at the mill, and testing
him and assigning his career, first by school examinations, 
and then by his official performances, we
will make him in time Poet Laureate or President
of the Board of Trade, according to the bent of
his genius.' The astonished workman turns round
upon the exhibitors of this fairy vision: 'And pray
who are You ?' 'Oh, you, we, the people, all of us
together. Come put your shoulder to the wheel,
and up goes our enterprise. Or rather our first
motion is downwards: down with landlords and
cotton-lords and lords of parliament, down with
contractors and stock-jobbers and all who live on
the interest of their money, and then our honourable 
multitude will possess and administer and govern.'<p>

5. If angels are to hold the collective ownership
of capital and the government of men in the Socialist
Commonwealth; or if every citizens retaining in
his private capacity all the follies and vices that
human flesh is heir to, shall still be vested in
angelic attributes, whenever he sits as legislator or
judge, or acts on the executive of a Socialist commission,
-- then this new Commonwealth is likely to
prove a blessed substitute for the rule of the higher
classes, which in one way or another has hitherto
obtained in civilized society. But till angelic
attributes descend on earth, we shall not find a
cure for the evils of cities and countries in simply
doubling the functions of government, and placing
all sovereign rights, and all the most important of
proprietary rights and duties, in the hands of a
numerical majority.<p>

6. Capital, as we have seen, is a collection of
market or exchange values in view of further
exchange. If we call supply S and demand D,
market value is a social estimate of the fraction D/S.
Another definition has been given: Market value
is a social estimate of the amount of socially useful
labour which a given article contains. This second
definition contains this much of truth in it, that
directly as the demand for an article, and inversely
as the supply of the same, is the amount of labour
which men find it worth their while to spend upon
that article for commercial purposes. Otherwise
the definition is unsatisfactory and involved, and
leads to endless discussion. Without entering into
these discussions, we will remark an ambiguity in
the term on which they all roll, the term <i>labour</i>,
which ambiguity is at the bottom of three fourths
of the sophistries of popular Socialism.<p>

7. There were two pillars put at the entrance of
Solomon's temple, one on the right hand and the
other on the left: that which was on the right hand
he called, according to the Septuagint, Direction,
<b>katorth&ocirc;sis</b>, and that on the left hand, Strength, 
<b>ischus</b> (2 Par. iii. 17.) Further we are told that Solomon
set seventy thousand men to carry burdens on their
shoulders, and eighty thousand to hew stones in the
mountains, and three thousand six hundred to be
overseers of the work of the people. (2 Par. ii. 18.)
The history is manifest. Strength and Direction
build the Temple: Strength, or Manual Labour,
represented by the hodmen and quarrymen, and the
rest of the "hands:" Direction, or Mental Labour,
represented by the overseers. Yet not by them
alone: surely we must count in as doers of mental
labour the designer of the Temple, or at least of its
decorations, that "most wise and skilful man, my
father Hiram; "and still more King Solomon himself 
and David, the two royal minds that originated
and perfected the idea; and David's generals, Joab
and Banaias, who secured the peace that was 
necessary as a condition of the building; and innumerable 
other men of place and power in the nation,
but for whose thought and prudence the strength of
the workman would have been thrown away like a
river poured out in the Libyan desert. From this
example, eked out with a little thought of his own,
the reader may estimate the wisdom and credit of
those who tell factory hands that it is their labour
which produces all the wealth of their employer,
and that, in the day when every man shall receive
his due, the employer shall be made a workmen like
themselves, and his wealth shall go to the increase
of their common wages.<p>

8. Certainly, it will be said, the employer should
be paid for his mental labour, but why at so enormously 
higher a rate than the manual labourers?
If we say, 'because his labour is more valuable,'
some Socialists would join issue on the score that
labour is valuable according to the time that it
takes, and the employer works shorter hours than
his men. But this taking account of <i>quantity</i> alone
in labour is an ignoring of the distinction which we
have drawn of two <i>qualities</i> or <i>orders</i> of labour,
mental and manual; one more valuable than the
other as being scarcer and in greater demand, so
that a short time of one may be set against a long
time of another, like a little gold against a heap of
brass. Any man accustomed to both orders of
labour must have observed, that while he can work
with his hands at almost any time when he is well,
the highest labour of his intellect can be done only
at rare intervals, and that in one happy hour he will
sometimes accomplish more than in a day.  As the
same man differs from himself at different times, so
does one man from another in the average value of
his mental efforts: this value is not measured by
time.<p>

9. Abandoning this untenable position, Socialists
still ask: 'But is the difference in the value of
their labour quite so vast as is the interval between
the profits of the employer and the pay of his poor
drudges?' Honestly we cannot say that it is.  We
are fain to fall back upon the consideration, that
the employer contributes, not only his brains to the
work, but his capital.  'Ah, that is just it,' is the,
Socialists' quick reply: 'We propose to relieve him
of his capital, and remunerate his brainwork only:
by that means we shall be able to pay sufficiently
handsome wages for management, according to the
ratio of mental and manual labour, and at the same
time have a sufficiently large surplus over to raise the
wages of his needy comrades, those seventy thousand
hodmen and eighty thousand quarrymen.' It may
be remarked that, if labour is to be bought like
commodities at the lowest market-price, this is
promising to pay for manual labour at a far higher
figure than it is commercially worth. But let that
pass: it is only an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>.<p>

10. Two reasons may be given for turning away
from this seductive proposal, and leaving capital
(not <i>consumer's wealth</i> merely) in private hands, --
and that not only in the hands of what we may
call <i>mentally productive capitalists</i>, men who oversee
their own enterprises and manage their own workmen, 
but even of <i>unproductive capitalists</i>, men
who have shares in and reap profits out of a
business which they never meddle with. The first
reason is, because this position of the productive,
and still more that of the unproductive capitalist, is
a prize for past industry expended upon production.  
To understand this, we must recollect once more
that men work, not as individuals, but as heads of
families. Every working man, from the sailor to
the shop-boy, covets for himself two things, pay
and leisure.  The same two things do mentally 
productive labourers covet. But they covet them, not
for themselves alone, but for their families, and more
even for their families than for themselves.  They
weary their brains, planning and managing, that in
old age they may retire on a competence, and hand
down that same competence, undiminished by their
having lived on it, to their children. Thus the
young man works and produces, that the old man,
and the child to come, may have exemption from
productive labour, an abiding exemption, which
cannot be unless he is allowed to live on the interest
of accumulated capital. These positions of affluence
and rest -- sinecures they are, so far as production is
concerned -- are the prizes awarded to the best 
productive labour. What they who do that labour aim
at, is not wages but exemption from toil: their wish
is not so much to be wealthy and have leisure themselves 
as to found a family in wealth and leisure, --
the one possible foundation of such a family being
a store of private capital. Socialists of course will
offer nobler prizes for the best productive labour, --
honour, and the satisfaction of having served the
community, a satisfaction which they would have
men trained from childhood to relish above all other
joys. Unfortunately, this taste is yet unformed, and
the stimulus of these nobler prizes is still unproved
by experience. Meanwhile men do work hard, to
the advantage of the community, for the ignobler
prize of family affluence and ease. Socialists are
going to take away the good boy's cake and give
him a sunflower.<p>

11. The second reason for leaving capital in
private, even unproductive hands, begins from the
consideration, that the highest end of man on earth
is not production, just as it is not consumption, of
the necessaries and luxuries of life. Aristotle bids
us, as much as possible in this life, "to play the
immortal (<b>athanatizein</b>), and do our utmost to live by
the best element in our nature," that is, the intellect.
(<i>Ethics</i>, c. i., s. ii., n. 7, p. 9.) There is the intellectual
life of the statesman in the practical order: and in
the speculative order, that of the poet, of the artist,
of the scholar, of the devout contemplative -- the 
outcome ot learned and pious leisure, and freedom from
vulgar cares. One man ascending into this higher
and better region helps his neighbour to follow. The
neighbour can follow, even though he be not free
from productive cares, but the leader ought to be
free, if he is to soar a high, sustained and powerful
flight, and guide others aloft. These unproductive
capitalist families then form what we may call, by
a figure which rhetoricians call <i>oxymoron</i>, something
which comes very near a bull, -- we may call them
an <i>endowed lay-clergy</i>: they are told off from the
rest of men to lead the way in doing, and causing to
be done, the highest work of humanity. The absence
of the First Class of Workers would render the
Socialist Utopia a very vulgar place.<p>

12. Nature's ideal is: <i>To all, plenty : to some,
superabundance</i>. The superabundance of some is
not necessarily incompatible with all having plenty:
nay it is a positive furtherance of that and of still
higher ends, as has been shown. But it is a position
of advantage that may be abused, and is abused
most wantonly: hence there comes to be question
of Socialism.<p>

Economy</i> (Stonyhurst Series), bk. iii., cc. vi. xi.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section III. -- <i>Of Landed Property</i>.</h2>

1. Land, like cotton, timber, or iron-ore, is a
raw material wrought up by man. Land, like any
other thing, becomes an article of property originally
by occupation, and its value is enhanced by labour.
There is no more reason why all land, or the rents
of all land, should belong to the State, than why all
house property, or all house rents, should belong to
the State. If the people need land to live on, so do
they need houses to live in, coals to burn, and shoes
to wear. Socialism, once admitted, cannot be confined 
to land alone. It will exterminate "the lord
manufacturer" as remorselessly as it exterminates
the landlord.<p>

2. Every man, it is contended, has a right to
live on the fruits of the soil. The proposition is
needlessly long. It should be put simply: Every
man has a right to live. For as to living on the
fruits of the soil, there is absolutely nothing else
that man can live on. All human nutriment whatever 
is derived from what geologists call pulverized
rocks, that is, soil. But if it is meant that every
man has a right to live on the fruits of some soil or
land of his own, where is the proof? So long as
the fruits of the earth do not fail to reach a man's
mouth, what matters it whose earth it is that grows
them? Some of the richest as well as the poorest
members of the community are landless men. Confiscate 
rent to take the place of taxation, and some
of the richest men in the community will go tax-free.<p>

3. The land on which a nation is settled, we are
told, belongs to that nation. Yes, it belongs to
them as individuals, yet not so that a foreigner is
excluded by natural law from owning any portion of
it. But the government have over the land, and
over all the property upon it, what is called <i>altum
dominium</i>, or <i>eminent domain</i>, which is a power of
commanding private proprietors to part with their
property for public purposes, with compensation,
whenever compensation is possible. Thus when a
railway gets its Act of Parliament, the owners
through whose estates the projected line is to run
are compelled by an exercise of <i>eminent domain</i> to
sell to the company. By the same power the
government in a besieged city, when hard pressed,
might seize upon all the stores of food and fuel
within the walls, even without compensation. <i>Altum
dominium</i>, which is not dominion properly so called,
is sufficient for all national emergencies, without
making the State the universal landlord.<p>

4. It seems impossible to imagine an emergency
that would justify any government in nationalizing
all the land at once without compensation. None
but a wealthy government could afford the compensation 
requisite; and the emergency would have to
be severe indeed, to make it wise of them to incur
such an expense. We can imagine a government
in a newly settled country starting on the understanding 
that all land was State land, and that all
ground rents were to be paid into the State exchequer. 
This would amount to taking rents for
taxes; and instead of a landlord in every district
we should have a tax-gatherer. Probably further
taxation would be necessary: in England at any
rate the annual expenditure exceeds the rental by
some twenty millions. Government, we may suppose, 
would grant leases of land: when the lease
fell in, the rent would be raised for unearned 
increment, and lowered for decrement, but not raised
for improvements effected by the tenant himself.  
In that case the tenant in two or three generations
might be a quasi-proprietor, his rent being ridiculously 
small in comparison with the annual value of
the holding. The improvements might be the 
improvements of his grandfather, or even those of a
complete stranger, from whom he had bought the
tenancy.  Anyhow they might be the better portion
of the value of the land, and would not be government 
property. Or would the government insist
on purchasing the improvements, and look out for a
new tenant paying a higher rent? Lastly, would the
government themselves make such improvements as
many an English landlord makes now, for love of
the country about him and love of his own people?<p>

5. It would be most difficult to prevent private
property arising in land, even if it all did belong to
the State to start with. "Suppose 10 pounds  paid for a
piece of land for a year, and suppose the occupier
said, Let me have it for ten years, and I will give you
20 pounds a year, ought not the State to accept the offer?
Then suppose he said, Give it me for ever and I will
pay 30 pounds a year? Again, ought not the State to
agree? He would then be that hateful creature a
landowner, subject to a rent-charge. Now suppose
the State wanted to do work and had to borrow
money, and suppose be offered to give for the 
redemption of the rent-charge a sum which could not
be borrowed for less than 40 pounds a year.  Again, ought
not the State to accept his offer? Yet in that case
he would become a hopelessly unmitigated landlord."
(Lord Bramwell.)<p>

6. When there is an alarm of fire in a theatre,
any one who could convince the audience that there
was time enough for them all to file out in slow
succession by the door, would avert the greatest
danger that threatened them, that of being crushed
and trampled on by one another. Mankind in pursuit 
of wealth are like a crowd rushing excitedly
through a narrow place of exit. Whatever man, or
body of men, or institution, or doctrine, will moderate
this "love of money" (<b>philarguria</b>), which St. Paul
(1 Tim. vi. 10) declares to be "the root of all evils,"
the same is a benefactor to the human race, preventing 
that cruel oppression of the poor, which comes
of ruthlessly buying land, labour, everything, in the
cheapest market and selling it in the dearest. The
landlord who always evicts, if he is not paid the
highest competition rent, -- the employer who brings
in from afar the hands that will work at the lowest
starvation wage, -- these vultures are worse enemies
to society than Socialists, for they occasion Socialism<p>

7. Socialism, whether in land alone or in all capital,
is an endeavour to accomplish by State control the
results that ought to be achieved by private virtue.
A landlord, or an employer, who remembers his
position as being what Homer calls "a king of men,"
<b>anax andr&ocirc;n</b>, -- remembers too, with Aristotle, that a
prince exists for his people, -- and who, besides a
quasi-royal care for the body of tenantry or workmen 
over whom he presides, has something too of a
fatherly interest in every one of them, their persons
and their families, holding it to be a personal tie
with himself, to be in his employment or settled upon
his land, -- such a man and the multitude of such men
form the best bulwark a country can possess against
Socialism. Such a landlord or employer is a <i>praesens
numen</i> to his workpeople or tenants.  In the absence
of this protective, personal influence of the rich over
the poor; in the disorganization of society consequent 
upon the misconduct of its subordinate chiefs;
in the stand-off attitude of the higher classes, and
the defiant independence of the lower; and in the
greed of material goods that is common to them
both, there lurks a danger of unknown magnitude to
our modern civilization.<p>

Encyclical Of 15th May, 1891. ["The right of property attaches to things 
produced by labour, but cannot attach to things created by God." So 
Henry George, <i>Condition of Labour</i>, pp. 3, 4. How then do we read in 
Progress and Poverty, bk. 7. ch. r: "The pen with which I am writing 
is justly mine," and that, in the last resort, on account of "the 
rights of those who dug the material from the ground and converted it 
into a pen" ? Was not that material, iron-ore, "created by God," 
equally with any other portion of the earth's crust that we may
please to call land?]
