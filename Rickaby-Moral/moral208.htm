<h1>Chapter VIII. Of the State.</h1>

<hr><p><h2>Section I. -- <i>Of the Monstrosities called Leviathan 
and Social Contract</i>.</h2>

1. THOMAS HOBBES, than whom never was greater
genius for riding an idea, right or wrong, to the full
length that it will go, was born in 1588: and 
notwithstanding his twelve pipes of tobacco daily, his
vigorous constitution endured to his ninety-second
year. The first half of his life fell in with the age of
the greatest predominance of Calvinism.  In religion
he was scarcely a Calvinist, indeed he laboured
under a suspicion of atheism: but his philosophy is
accurately cast in the mould of the grim theology of
Geneva. We may call it the philosophy of Calvinism.
It has for its central tenet, that human nature either
was from the first, or is become, bad, "desperately
wicked," depraved, corrupt, and utterly abominable,
so that whatever is natural to man, in so far forth as
it is natural, is simply evil. The remedy for our
evil nature Hobbes finds in no imputed merits of a
Redeemer, no irresistible victorious grace, but in
the masterful coercion of a despotic civil power.
But, lest any one should suspect that there was at
least this good in man, a propensity to civil society
and obedience to the rulers of cities, Hobbes insists
that man is by nature wholly averse to society with
his kind: that the type of the race is an Ishmael, "a
wild man, his hand against all men, and all men's
hands against him:" in fact that the state of nature
is a state of war all round. He writes (<i>Leviathan</i>,
c. xiii.): "Men have no pleasure, but on the contrary
a great deal of grief, in keeping company where
there is no power able to overawe them all. For
every man looketh that his companion should value
him at the same rate he sets on himself; and upon
all signs of contempt or undervaluing naturally 
endeavours, as far as he dares (which among them that
have no common power to keep them quiet, is far
enough to make them destroy each other), to extort
a greater value from his contemners by damage,
and from others by the example. . . . Hereby it is
manifest, that during the time that men live without
a power to keep them all in awe, they are in that
condition which is called war, and such a war as
is of every man against every man. . . . In such
condition there is no place for industry, because the
fruit thereof is uncertain, and consequently no culture
of the earth: no navigation, nor use of the 
commodities that may be imported by sea: no 
commodious building: no instruments of moving and
removing such things as require much force: no
knowledge of the face of the earth: no account of
time: no arts, no letters, no society; and which is
worst of all, continual fear and danger of violent
death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty,
brutish, and short. To this war of every man
against every man this also is consequent, that
nothing can be unjust. The notions of right and
wrong, justice and injustice, have there no place.
Where there is no common power there is no law:
where no law, no injustice. . . . It is consequent
also to the same condition, that there be no propriety, 
no dominion, no <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i> distinct, but
only that to be every man's that he can get, and for
so long as he can keep it."<p>

2. Such is what Hobbes is pleased to call "the
natural condition of mankind," a condition which
man would have every natural reason for getting out
of with all speed, were he ever so unhappy as to fall
into it.  It is true that, apart from civil government,
violence would reign on earth. But it is not true
that to live apart from civil government is the natural
condition of mankind.  It is not true that the only
motive which draws men into civil society is the fear
of violence, as though there were no such facts and
exigencies of human nature as sympathy, friendship,
intellectual curiosity, art, religion. It is not true
that the one reason for the existence of the civil
power consists in this, that without the restraining
hand of the magistrate men would bite and devour
one another. Lastly, it is not true that all rights,
notably rights of property, are the creation of the
State. A man is a man first and a citizen afterwards. 
As a man, he has certain rights actual and
potential (c. v., s. i., p. 244): these the State exists, not
to create, for they are prior to it in the order of
nature, but to determine them, where indeterminate,
to sanction and to safeguard them.<p>

Natural rights go before legal rights, and are 
presupposed to them, as the law of nature before that
law which is civil and positive. It is an "idol of the
tribe" of lawyers to ignore all law but that upon
which their own professional action takes its stand.<p>

3. "In considering man as he must have come
from the hands of nature," writes Jean Jacques
Rousseau, "I behold an animal less strong than
some, less active than others, but upon the whole in
organism having the advantage of them all. I behold
him appeasing his hunger under an oak, slaking
his thirst in the first brook, finding a bed at the
foot of the same tree that furnished his repast, and
there you have all his cravings satisfied." (<i>Discours
sur l'origine de l'in&eacute;galit&eacute;</i>.) This noble savage -- quite
a contrast to Hobbes's ruffian primeval, "nasty,
brutish," and short-lived -- observes and imitates the
industry, and gradually raises himself to the instinct
of the beasts among whom he lives.  His constitution 
is robust, and almost inaccessible to malady.
He attains to old age, free from gout and rheumatism. 
He surpasses the fiercest wild beasts in
address as much as they surpass him in strength,
and so arrives to dwell among them without fear.
Yet withal he is distinguished from brutes by free-will 
and perfectibility, qualities which gradually draw
him out of his primeval condition of tranquil innocence, 
lead him through a long course of splendours
and errors, of vices and virtues, and end by making
him a tyrant at once over nature and over himself.<p>

4. Rousseau's life, 1715-1778, was a continual
protest against the formalism, affectation, pedantry
and despotism of the age of the Bourbons. His
ideal of man was the unconventional, unconstrained,
solitary, but harmless and easy-going savage.  Hobbes
was the growth of a sterner and more serious age.  
The only reality to him in heaven and on earth was
force: his one idea in philosophy was coercion.
Human nature to him was an embodiment of brute
violence ever in need of violent restraint.  Rousseau,
an optimist, saw nothing but good in man's original
nature: to the pessimist mind of Hobbes all was
evil there. Neither of them saw any natural adaptation 
to social life in the human constitution. To
live in society was, in both their views, an artificial
arrangement, an arbitrary convention. But Hobbes
found in the intolerable evils of a state of nature an
excellent reason why men should quit it for the
unnatural condition of citizens. Rousseau found
no reason except, as he says, <i>quelque funeste hasard</i>.  
The problem for Hobbes stood thus: how men
entering society, might be "cribbed, cabined, and
confined" to the utmost in order to keep down
their native badness. Rousseau's concern was, how
one might so become a citizen as yet to retain to
the full the delightful liberty of a tropical savage.
Hobbes's solution is the <i>Leviathan</i>, Rousseau's the
<i>Social Contract</i>. The prize, we think, rests with the
Englishman: but the reader shall judge.<p>

5. And first of the Social Contract. Rousseau
proposes "to find a form of association which shall
defend and protect with all the strength of the 
community the person and the goods of each associate,
and whereby each one, uniting himself to all, may
nevertheless obey none but himself and remain
as free as before." (<i>Contrat Social</i>, i. 6.) This
proposal is hopeless, it is a contradiction in terms.
No man can contract and remain as free as before,
but he binds himself either under a <i>wider</i> obligation
to do or abstain, where he was not bound before, or
under a <i>stronger obligation</i> where he was bound
already. Nevertheless Rousseau finds a means of
accomplishing the impossible and the self-contradictory. 
"Each of us puts into a common stock
his person and all his power under the supreme
direction of the general will; and we receive in our
turn the offering of the rest, each member as an
inseparable part of the whole. Instantly, instead
of the private person of each contracting party,
this act of association produces a moral and 
collective body, composed of as many members as the
assembly has voices, which body receives by this
same act its unity, its common Ego, its life and its
will." (<i>ib.</i>) This awful signing away of all your
rights, so that your very personality is merged in
that of the community -- a self-renunciation going far
beyond that of profession in any religious order --
ought certainly, as Rousseau says, to be "the most
voluntary act in the world;" and he adds the
characteristic reason: "every man being born free
and master of himself, none can, under any pretence
whatsoever, subject him without his own consent."
(<i>Contrat Social</i>, iv. 2.) Then you ask: When have
I made this large contract by the most voluntary act
in the world? Rousseau replies: "When the State
is instituted, consent is in residing." (<i>ib.</i>) But, you
reply, my residence is anything but the most voluntary 
act in the world: it would be awkward for me
to emigrate; and if I did emigrate, it would only be
to some other State: I cannot possibly camp out
and be independent in the woods, nor appease my
hunger under an oak. To this plea Rousseau quite
gives in, remarking that "family, goods, the want of
an asylum, necessity, violence, may keep an inhabitant 
in the country in spite of himself; and in that
case his mere sojourn no longer supposes his consent
to the contract." (<i>ib.</i>) Then none of us have made
the contract, for we have never had the option of
living anywhere except in some State.<p>

6. Hobbes, after laying down the necessity of
men combining for protection against mutual 
injustice, observes that a mere promise or agreement
not to injure any one will not suffice: "for the
agreement of men is by covenant only, which is
artificial; and therefore no wonder if there be
something else required besides covenant to make
their agreement constant and lasting, which is a
common power to keep them in awe and to direct
their actions to the common benefit." He continues:
"The only way to erect such a common power . . .
is to confer all their power and strength upon one
man or upon one assembly of men, that may reduce
all their wills by plurality of voices unto one will:
which is as much as to say, to appoint one man or
assembly of men to bear their person; and every one
to own, and to acknowledge himself to be the author
of, whatsoever he that so beareth their person shall
act or cause to be acted in those things which 
concern the common peace and safety; and therein to
submit their wills every one to his will, and their
judgments to his judgment. This is more than
consent or concord, -- it is a real unity of them all
in one and the same person, made by covenant of
every man with every man, in such manner as if
every man should say to every man: I authorise, and
give up my right of governing myself to this man
or to this assembly of men, on this condition, that
thou give up thy right to him, and authorise all his
actions in like manner. This done, the multitude
so united in one person is called a <i>commonwealth</i>, in
Latin <i>civitas</i>. This is the generation of that great
Leviathan, or rather, to speak more reverently, of
that mortal god, to whom we owe under the
immortal God our peace and defence." (<i>Leviathan</i>,
c. xvii.) This idea of all the rights and personalities
of the individuals who contract to live socially being
fused and welded together into the one resultant
personality and power of the State, has evidently
been borrowed by Rousseau from Hobbes. We
shall deal with the idea presently. Meanwhile
several points claim our notice.<p>

7. The hideous piece of cynicism whereby Rousseau 
(<i>Contrat Social</i>, iv. 2), after promising you that,
if you join his commonwealth, you shall obey none
but yourself, then goes on to tell you that you obey
yourself in obeying the will of the majority, even
when it puts you in irons or leads you to death --
because as a citizen you have once for all renounced
your own will, and can only wish what the majority
wishes, -- has its root in the position of Hobbes, that
"every subject is author of every act the sovereign
doth." (<i>Leviathan</i>, c. xxi.)<p>

8. A real and important difference between the
<i>Leviathan</i> and the <i>Social Contract</i>, is that Hobbes
(c. xix.) allows various distributions of sovereign
power, but prefers monarchy: Rousseau (l. ii., c. i.)
will have it that sovereignty is vested inalienably in
the people: of which doctrine more to follow.<p>

9. <i>Men are by ature equal</i>, say Rousseau and
Hobbes and many more respectable authors. Yes, in
their specific nature, that is, they are all equally men.
Similarly you have it that all triangles are equal, if
that is a proposition of any value. But men as
individuals are not all equal. One is stronger in
body, another more able in mind: one predisposed
to virtue, another to vice: one born in affluence
and honour, another in squalor.  Not men in the
abstract, but living men, start at different points of
vantage, and the distance between them widens as
they run the race of life. We may lay it down as
an axiom, in diametric opposition to Rousseau, that
inequalities are natural, equalities artificial.<p>

10. Man is born free: so opens the first chapter
of the <i>Contrat Social</i>. If free of all duties, then
void of all rights (c. v., s. i., nn. 5, 7, pp. 246, 247):
let him then be promptly knocked on the head as
a sacrifice to Malthus; and with the misformed
children born in Plato's Republic, "they will bury
him in a secret and unseen spot, as is befitting."<p>

11. Hobbes and Rousseau go upon this maxim,
which has overrun the modern world, that no man
can be bound to obedience to another without his
own consent. The maxim would be an excellent
one, were men framed like the categories of Aristotle --
substance, quantity, quality, relation, and the rest --
each peering out of his own pigeonhole, an independent, 
self-sufficient entity. But men are dependent, 
naturally dependent whether they will or no,
every human being on certain definite others, -- the
child on the parent, the citizen on the State whose
protection he enjoys, and all alike on God. These
natural dependences carry with them natural 
uncovenanted obediences, -- to parents, filial duty -- to
country, loyalty -- to God, piety: all which are 
embraced in the Latin term <i>pietas</i>. (See St. Thomas,
2a 2ae, q. 101, art. i, in corp.) The fatal maxim
before us is the annihilation of <i>pietas</i>. In lieu of
loyal submission we get a contract, a transaction of
reasoned commercial selfishness between equal and
equal. This perverse substitution has called forth
Leo XIII.'s remark on the men of our time,
"Nothing comes so amiss to them as subjection
and obedience," <i>Nihil tam moleste ferunt quam subesse
et parere</i>. (Encyclical on Christian Marriage.)<p>

12. The common extravagance of the <i>Leviathan</i>
and the <i>Social Contract</i> is the suppression of the
individual, with his rights and his very personality,
which is all blended in the State. (See Rousseau's
words above quoted, n. 5, and those of Hobbes,
n. 6.) The reservations in favour of the individual
made by Hobbes, <i>Leviathan</i>, c. xxi., and by Rous-
seau, <i>Contrat Social</i>, l. ii., c. iv., are either trifles or
self-contradictions. But it is not in man's power
by any contract thus to change his nature, so as to
become from autocentric heterocentric (c. ii., s. i., n. 2,
p. 203; c. v., s. i., n. 1, p. 244), from a person a thing,
from a man a chattel, void of rights and consequently
of duties, and bound to serve this Collective Monster,
this Aggregated Idol, with the absolute devotedness
that is due to God alone. The worship of the new
Moloch goes well with the dark misanthropism of
Hobbes: but in Rousseau, the believer in the perfect
goodness of unrestrained humanity, it is about the
most glaring of his many inconsistencies.  It is of
course eagerly taken up by the Socialists, as carrying
all their conclusions. It is the political aspect of
Socialism.<p>

<i>Reading</i>. -- Burke, <i>Warren Hastings</i>, Fourth Day,
the passage beginning, "He have arbitrary power".<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- <i>Of the theory that civil Power is an aggregate
formed by subscription of the powers of individuals</i>.</h2>

1. The Greeks had a name <b>epanos</b>, which meant
a feast where the viands were supplied by each guest
contributing in kind. If, in a party of four, one
man brought a ham, another a rabbit, a third a dish
of truffles, and a fourth a salmon, no one would
expect that, when the cover was raised, there should
appear a pigeon-pie. That would not be in the
nature of an <b>epanos</b>. Now not only Hobbes and
Rousseau, but Locke and a great multitude of
modern Englishmen with him, hold that the power
of the State is an aggregate, the algebraic sum of
the powers whereof the component members would
have stood possessed, had they lived in what is
called, by a misleading phrase, the state of nature,"
that is, the condition of men not subject to civil
authority.  These powers, -- either, as Hobbes and
Rousseau virtually say, all of them, or, as Locke
and the common opinion has it, only some of them, --
men are supposed to resign as they enter into
the State. If therefore there appears in the City,
Nation, State, or Commonwealth, a certain new and
peculiar power, which belongs to no individual in
the "state of nature," or, as I prefer to call it, the
extra-civil state, then what we may designate as
the Aggregation Theory breaks down, and another
origin must be sought of civil principality. But
there is such a power in the State, new and peculiar,
and not found in any of the component individuals:
it is the power and authority to punish on civil
grounds. It is the right of the rods and axes, that
were borne before the Roman magistrate. It is, in
its most crucial form, the right to punish with
death.<p>

2. We are not here concerned with proving the
existence of this right. It is generally admitted:
we assume it accordingly, and shall prove it later
on. Nor are we concerned with domestic punishment, 
inflicted by the head of a family within his
own household, for the good of that household,
stopping short of any irreparable harm to the sufferer.
(St.  Thos., 2a 2ae, q. 65, art. 2, ad. 2.) Leaving this
aside, we say, and have proved already, that one
private individual has no right to punish another,
neither medicinally for the amendment of the delinquent, 
nor by way of deterrent for the good of the
community, nor in the way of retribution for his own
satisfaction. He has the right of self-defence, but
not of punishment: the two things are quite
different. He may also exact restitution, where
restitution is due: but that again is not punishing.
If he is in the extra-civil state, he may use force,
where prudence allows it, to recover what he has
lost. This right of private way really is surrendered
by the individual, when the State is established:
but war and punishment are two totally different
ideas. Subjects are punished: war is levied on
independent powers.  (<i>Ethics</i>, c. ix., s. iii., nn. 4-6,
pp. 171-174; <i>Natural Law</i>, c. ii., s. ii., n. 6, 8. 212.)<p>

3. Opposite is the o inion of Locke, who writes:
"The execution of the law of nature is in that
state [of nature] put into every man's hands, whereby
every one has a right to punish the transgressors of
that law to such a degree as may hinder its violation: 
for the law of nature would, as all other laws
that concern men in this world, be in vain, if there
were nobody that in the state of nature had a power
to execute that law." We observe that the punishment 
of offenders against the law of nature, as such,
belongs to the Legislator, who is God alone. Certainly 
it is well, nay necessary, that there should be
human law to bear out the law of nature: but
human law is the creation of human society in its
perfection, which is the State. Man is punished by
man for breaking the laws of man, not -- except
remotely -- for breaking the laws of God. Nor
would it be any inconvenience, if the law of nature
were in vain in a state wherein nature never intended
men to live, wherein no multitude of men ever for
any notable time have lived, a state which is neither
actual fact nor ideal perfection, but a mere property
of the philosophic stage, a broken article, an outworn 
speculation. Such is "the state of nature,"
as identified with the extra-civil state by Hobbes,
Locke, and Rousseau.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section III. -- <i>Of the true state of mature, which is the state 
of civil society; and consequently of the divine origin of 
power</i>.</h2> 

1. The State is defined by Aristotle (<i>Politics</i>,
III., ix., 14): "the union of septs and villages in
a complete and self-sufficient life." The first and
most elementary community is the <i>family</i>, <b>oikia</b>.
A knot of families associating together, claiming
blood-relationship and descent, real or fictitious,
from a common ancestor, whose name they bear,
constitute a <b>genos</b>, called in Ireland a <i>sept</i> in 
Scotland a <i>clan</i>, nameless in England.  When the sept
come to cluster their habitations, or encampments,
in one or more spots, and to admit strangers in
blood to dwell among them, these hamlets, or camps,
gradually reach the magnitude of a <i>village</i>.  When
a number of these <i>villages</i>, belonging to different
septs, come to be contiguous to one another, this
mere juxtaposition does not make of them a State.  
Nor does interchange of commodities, nor inter-marriage, 
nor an offensive and defensive alliance --
these are the mutual relations of a <i>confederacy</i>, 
<b>Xumachia</b>,but all these and more are needed for a State,
<b>polis</b>. To be a State, it is requisite that these septs
and villages should agree to regulate the conduct of
their individual members by a common standard of
social virtue, sufficient for their well-being as one
community. This common standard is fixed by
common consent, or by the decision of some power
competent to act for all and to punish delinquents.
The name of this common standard is law. (<i>Ethics</i>,
c, vii., n. i, p. 126.) The community thus formed leads
a life complete and self-sufficient, not being a member
of another, but a body by itself, -- not part of any
ulterior community, but complete in the fulness of
social good and social authority.<p>

2. Among the ancient Greeks and Italians, and
to some extent also in mediaeval Italy and Germany,
the city or municipality, with the small country
district attached, was the State.  With us the
nation is the State; and accordingly we say <i>my
country</i> where the Greek said <i>my city</i>. Bearing this
difference in mind, as also the fact that the <i>sept</i> is
not known amongst us except to antiquarians, and
likewise that the <i>village</i> with us coincides with the
<i>parish</i>, and that there are town as well as country
parishes, -- upon these modern data we may amend
Aristotle's definition thus: <i>The State is the union of
parishes and municipalities in a perfect and self-sufficient
community</i>.<p>

3. The City State is well illustrated in the following 
narrative of Thucydides (ii., 15):<p>

"In the time of Cecrops and the early kings as
far as Theseus' Attica was always divided among
several independent cities, with their own town-halls
and magistrates; and when there was no alarm of
an enemy, the inhabitants did not resort for common
deliberation to the King, but severally managed
their own affairs and took their own counsel, and
some of them even went to war. But when Theseus
came to the throne, he abolished the council-chambers 
and magistracies of the other cities, and
centralised all the people in what is now the city [of
Athens], where he appointed their one council-chamber 
and town-hall; and while they continued
to occupy their own properties as before, he forced
them to recognise this as their one city and State."
Attica before Theseus was a confederacy, <b>Xumachia</b>,
not a State, <b>polis</b><p>

4. A <i>citizen</i> is defined: "one who has access to
a share in deliberative and judicial functions." (Ar.,
<i>Pol</i>. III., i., 12.) It is not necessary that he actually
should share these functions, but the way to them
should lie open to him: he should be a person qualified 
to share in them. There are various degrees of
citizenship. Under a parliamentary government,
we distinguish the member of parliament, the elector,
and him who will be an elector as soon as he gets a
house of his own; and again, the judge, and him
who is liable to serve on juries. In an absolute
monarchy there are no <i>citizens</i>, only <i>subjects</i>.<p>

5. "The distribution of power in the State, and
especially of the sovereign power, is called the
<i>polity</i>" (<b>politeia</b>, Ar., <i>Pol</i>., III., vi., i),
-- a word immortalised by the judicious Hooker, and happily
recovered recently to the English language. The
<i>polity</i> then is the distribution of the sovereignty.  
The person singular or collective, in whose hands
the full sovereignty rests, is called the <i>ruler</i>. Be it
observed that what we call the ruler is never one
man, except in absolute monarchy.  By the theory
of the, British Constitution, the ruler is King, Lords,
and Commons, together.<p>

6. <i>Nature requires that men generally live in society,
domestic and civil, so that the individual be of the family,
and families form associations, which again conspire to
form one, perfect community, which is the State</i>. The
requirement of nature may be gathered from the
universal practice of mankind.  "If it (the word
<i>savage</i>) means people without a settled form of
government, without laws and without a religion,
then, go where you like, you will not find such a
race." (Max M&uuml;ller, in <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, Jan. 1885,
p. 114.) The same may be gathered from a 
consideration of what the State is, and of the ends
which it serves.  The State, as we have seen (n. 2),
is a union of septs and villages, or of parishes
and municipalities. The individual is born and
nurtured in the family, and ordinarily becomes
in time the parent of a new family. Families
must combine to form septs by blood, or villages
(or parishes) by locality.  Municipalities we may
leave aside, for a municipality is a potential State
But we must consider the sept, village, or parish,
which is the community intermediate between family,
and State.  Among the cogent reasons which require
families to enter into this association, we may
mention friendship, intermarriage, the interchange
of services and commodities, the cultivation of the
arts, the preservation of traditions and inventions.<p>


7.     But it is further necessary that these septs,
villages, or parishes, should band together and combine 
to form a higher community, self-sufficient and
perfect, -- for the determining of rights which Natural
Law leaves undetermined, -- for the punishing of
disturbers of the peace, if need be, even with death,
-- for defence against a common enemy, -- for a union
of counsels and resources to the execution of magnificent 
works.  This self-sufficient and perfect community, 
which is not part of any higher community,
is the State.<p>

8. We may observe that the whole reason for
the being of the State is not mutual need, nor the
repression of violence. Main reasons these are, no
doubt, but not the whole main reason. Even if men
had no need of one another for the supply of their
animal wants, they would still desire to converse for
the satisfaction of their intellectual curiosity and
their social affections. And even if we had all remained 
as void of guile, and as full of light and love,
as our first parents were at their creation, we should
still have needed the erection of States.  In a State
there are not only criminal but civil courts, where it
is not wicked men alone who come to be litigants.
From sundry passages of Scripture it would appear
that even angels may disagree as to what is best and
proper: angelic men certainly may and do. It is
a mistake to look upon civil government, with its
apparatus of laws and judgments, simply as a 
necessary evil, and remedy of the perverseness of 
mankind.  On the contrary, were all men virtuous,
States would still be formed, towering in magnificence 
above the States known to history, as the
cedars of Lebanon above the scanty growths of a
fell-side in our north country.<p>

9. <i>There can be no State without a tower to guide
and govern it</i>. It has indeed become the fashion to
repeat, as the latest discovery in politics, that what
a State needs is not government but administration.
This saying comes of a theory, to be examined 
presently, that sovereign power abides permanently
with the people at large, and that the sole function
of princes, cabinets, and parliaments, is to provide
means of giving effect to the popular will. This
however is not quite a repudiation of government,
but a peculiar view as to the seat and centre of
government. Those who hold it, vigorously maintain 
the right of the Many to govern, control, and
command the Few. The need of some governing
authority in a State can be denied by none but an
Anarchist, a gentleman who lives two doors beyond
Rousseau on the side of unreason.<p>

10. <i>Every State is autonomous, self-governing, independent</i>. 
Either the whole people taken collectively
must rule the same whole taken distributively, or a
part must rule the rest. The ruler is either the whole
commonwealth, or more frequently a part of the
commonwealth. An autocrat is part of the State
which he governs. Sovereignty whole and entire is
intrinsic to the State.  A community that is to any
extent governed from without, like British India or
London, is not a State, but part of a State, for it is
not a <i>perfect community</i>.<p>

11. We have it therefore that <i>man is a social
animal</i>.  Naturally he is a member of a family.  
Nature requires that families should coalesce into
higher communities, which again naturally converge
and culminate in the State. Nature further requires
that in every State there should be an authority to
govern. But authority to govern and duty to obey
are correlatives. Nature therefore requires submission 
to the governing authority in the State.  In
other words, Nature abhors anarchy as being the
destruction of civil society, and as cutting the ground
from under the feet of civilised man. The genuine
<i>state of nature</i>, that state and condition, which
nature allows and approves as proper for the 
evolution of the human faculties, is the state of man in
civil society. That is lost where there is no judge
in the land.<p>

12. There are men full of a sentimental deference
to authority and professions of obedience, who yet
will not obey any of the authorities that actually are
over them. These are disobedient men. He is an
anarchist in practice, who meditates treason and 
rebellion against the "powers that be" actually over
him in the State wherein he lives. To obey no actual
power is to obey no power, as to wear no actual
clothes is to go naked. To keep up the comparison,
as a man may change his clothes upon occasion,
and thus go through a brief interval of unclothedness
without injury to health or violation of decency, 
notwithstanding the requirement of nature to wear
clothes: so it may be or it may not be consonant
with the exigency of our nature at times to subvert
by insurrection the existing government in order to
the substitution of a new authority; that does not
concern us here. We are stating the general rule
under ordinary circumstances. The submission to
civil authority, which nature requires of us, must be
paid in the coin of obedience to the actual established 
"powers that be."<p>

13. Any one who understands how morality comes
from God (<i>Ethics</i>, c. vi., s. ii. nn. 6-9, 13, pp. 
119-125), can have no difficulty in seeing how civil power
is of God also. The one point covers the other. We
need no mention of God to show that disobedience,
lying, and the seven deadly sins, are bad things for
human nature, things to be avoided even if they were
not forbidden. All the things that God forbids are
against the good of man. Their being evil is 
distinguishable from their being prohibited, and 
antecedent to it. Now as drunkenness and unchastity are
evil for man, so too is anarchy. The one remedy for
anarchy is civil government.  Even if there were no
God, it would be still imperatively necessary, as we
have seen, for mankind to erect political institutions,
and to abide by the laws and ordinances of constitutional 
power. But there would be no formal obligation
of submission to these laws and ordinances; and 
resistance to this power would be no more than philosophic 
sin. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. vi., s. ii., n. 6, p. 119.) What makes
anarchy truly sinful and wrong is the prohibition of it
contained in the Eternal Law, that law whereby God
commands every creature, and particularly every man,
to act in accordance with his own proper being and
nature taken as a whole, and to avoid what is repugnant 
to the same. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. vi., s. ii., n. 9, p. 120.)
Therefore, as man is naturally social, and anarchy is
the dissolution of society, God forbids anarchy, and
enjoins obedience to the civil power, under pain of
sin and damnation. "They that resist, purchase to
themselves damnation" (Rom.  xiii. 2): where the
theological student, having the Greek text before
him, will observe that the same phrase is used as in
1 Cor. xi. 29 of the unworthy communicant, as
though it were the like sin to rend our Lord's
mystical Body by civil discord as to profane His
natural Body by sacrilege.  But to enjoin obedience
and to bestow authority are the obverse and reverse
of one and the same act.  God therefore gives the
civil ruler power and authority to command. This
is the meaning of St. Paul's teaching that there is
no power but from God, and that the powers that
be are ordained of God. (Rom. xiii. 1.)<p>

14. The argument is summed up in these seven
consequent propositions:<p>

<ul>
(a)Civil society is necessary to human nature.<br>
(b)Civil power is necessary to civil society.<br>
(c)Civil power is naught without civil obedience.<br>
(d)Civil obedience is necessary to human nature.<br>
(e)God commands whatever is necessary to human nature.<br>
(f)God commands obedience to the civil power.<br>
(g)God commissions the civil power to rule.
</ul><p>

15. If any one asks how the State and the civil
power is of God any otherwise than the railway
company with its power, or even the fever with its
virulence, a moment's reflection will reveal the
answer in the facts, that railway communication,
however convenient, is not an essential feature of
human life, as the State is: while diseases are not
requirements in order to good, but incidental defects
and evils of nature, permitted by God. Why God
leaves man to cope with such evils, is not the 
question here.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section IV. -- <i>Of the Variety of Polities</i>.</h2>

1. <i>One Polity alone is against the natural law; that
is every Polity which proves itself unworkable and 
inefficient: for the rest, various States exhibit various
Politics workable and lawful, partly from the circumstances, 
partly from the choice, of the citizens: but the
sum total of civil power is a constant quantity, the same
for all States</i>. We proceed to establish the clauses
of this statement in succession.<p>

2. If a watch be necessary to a railway guard, and
he is bound to have one accordingly, it is also 
necessary, and he is bound to procure it, that the watch
shall go and keep time. A watch that will not keep
time is an unlawful article for him to depend upon,
being tantamount to no watch, whereas he is bound
to have a watch. Otherwise, be his watch large or
small, gold, silver, or pinchbeck, all this is 
indifferent, so long as it be a reliable timekeeper. In
like manner, we must have a State, we must have a
government, and we must have a government that
can govern. Monarchy, aristocracy, parliaments, wide 
or narrow franchise, centralisation, decentralisation, 
any one of these and countless other forms --
apart from the means whereby it is set up -- is a
lawful government, where it is a workable one; 
unlawful, and forbidden by God and nature, where it
cannot work.  A form of government that from its
own intrinsic defects could nowhere work, would be
everywhere and always unlawful.<p>

3. You cannot argue from the accomplished fact
the lawfulness of the means whereby it was accomplished. 
Nor do we say that every form of government, 
which succeeds in governing, was originally
set up in justice; nor again that the success of its
rule is necessarily due to the use of just means. The
Committee of Public Safety in Paris in 1794 did
manage to govern, but it was erected in blood, and
it governed by an unscrupulous disregard of everybody's 
rights. All that we say is, that no distribution
of civil power as a distribution, or no polity as a polity
(s. iii., n. 5, p. 312), is unlawful, if by it the government 
can be carried on.  And the reason is plain.  
For all that nature requires is that there should be
an efficient civil authority, not that this man should
have it, or that one man or other should have it all,
or that a certain class in council assembled should
engross it, or that all the inhabitants of the country
should participate in it. Any one of these arrangements 
that will work, satisfies the exigency of nature
for civil rule, and is therefore in itself a lawful polity.<p>

4. Working, and therefore, as explained, lawful
polities are as multitudinous as the species of animals,
Besides those that actually are, there is a variety
without end, as of animals, so of polities, that might
be and are not. We can classify only the main
types.  We ground our classification upon Ar., <i>Pol</i>.,
III., vii., modernising it so as to take in forms of
representative government, whereof Aristotle had
no conception.<p>

(1) <i>Monarchy</i>, or the rule of the Single Person,
in whose hands the whole power of the State is 
concentrated,<i>e.g.</i>, Constantine the Great.<p>

(2) <i>Aristocracy</i>, or the rule of the Few, which will
be either direct or relresentative, according as either
they themselves by their own votes at first hand, or
representatives whom they elect, make the laws.<p>

(3) <i>Democracy</i>, or the rule, of the Many, that is,
of the whole community.  Democracy, again, is either
<i>direct</i> (commonly called <i>pure</i>) or <i>representative</i>.  The
most famous approach in history to pure democracy
is the government of Athens, b.c. 438-338.<p>

(4)<i>Limited Monarchy</i><br>
<ul>
(a) <i>Monarchy with Aristocracy</i>, the government of
England from 1688 to 1830.<br>
(b) <i>Monarchy with Democracy</i>.
</ul><p>

5. All civil government is for the governed, that
is, for the community at large. The perversion of a
polity is the losing sight of this principle, and the
conducting of the polity in the interest of the 
governing body alone. By such perversion monarchy
passes into <i>tyranny</i>, aristocracy into <i>oligarchy</i>, and
democracy into <i>ochlocracy</i> or <i>mob-rule</i>. It might
appear strange that, where the power rests with the
whole people collectively, government should ever
be carried on otherwise than in the interest of the
entire community, did we not remember that the
majority, with whom the power rests in a democracy,
may employ it to trample on and crush the minority.  
Thus the Many may worry and harass the Few,
the mean and poor the wealthy and noble: though
commonly perhaps the worrying has been the other
way about. Anyhow it is important to observe that
there is no polity which of itself, and apart from the
spirit in which it is worked, is an adequate safeguard
and rock of defence against oppression.<p>

6. The wide range of polities that history presents 
is not drawn out by the caprice of nations.
The very fact of a certain nation choosing a certain
polity, where they are free to choose, is an indication
of the bent of the national character, and character
is not a caprice. No North American population
are ever likely to elect an absolute monarch to
govern them. That polity which thrives on the
shores of the Caspian, can strike no root on the
banks of the Potomac.  The choice of a polity is
limited by the character of the electors and by the
circumstances in which the election is made. Not
every generation in a nation is free to choose its
polity: but the choice and institution of the fathers
binds the children.  Up to a certain point ancestral
settlements must be respected, or instability ensues,
and anarchy is not far off. Thus the spirit of freedom
should always act as Burke says, "as if in the presence 
of canonized forefathers."<p>

7. The smallest State in the world is the little
republic of Andorra in the Pyrenees. Though it be
a paradox to say it, there is as much political power
in Andorra as in Russia, -- one and the same measure
of it in every State. In every State there is power
for civil good to the full height of the emergencies
that may arise. The same emergencies may arise
everywhere, and everywhere there is full power to
see that the commonwealth take no harm by them.
What a great empire can do for this purpose,<i>e.g.</i>,
proclaim martial law, search houses, lay an embargo
on the means of transport, impress soldiers, the
same can the tiniest commonwealth do in the like
need. And the ordinary functions of government
are the same in both.<p>

8. This seems at variance with the theory of
some constitutions, according to which there are
certain so-called <i>fundamental laws</i>, which the 
legislature cannot call in question, nor deal with in any
way, but must take them in all its deliberations for
positions established and uncontrovertible. The
British Constitution recognizes no fundamental
laws. There is no reform that may not legally be
broached in Parliament and enacted there. Parliament 
is said to be "omnipotent," "able to do everything, 
except to make a man a woman." But in
many legislatures it is not so. At Athens of old
there were certain measures which no one could
introduce for discussion in the Sovereign Assembly
without rendering himself liable to a prosecution,
<b>graph&ecirc; paranom&ocirc;n</b>. And there have been many
monarchs termed absolute, who yet were bound
by their coronation-oath, or by some other agreement 
with their people, to preserve inviolate certain
institutions and to maintain certain laws. It may
be contended that such a government as we have in
England, which is theoretically competent to pass,
any law within the limits of the natural law, has a.
greater range of power than a government whose,
operation is limited by a barrier of fundamental
positive law. But this contention vanishes when
we observe that there must remain in the State,
which has fundamental laws, a power somewhere
to reverse them. They can be reversed at least by
the consent of the whole people. Thus at Athens.
the <b>graph&ecirc; paranom&ocirc;n</b> could be suspended by a vote
of the Assembly. A people can release their monarch
from his coronation-oath in such portions of it as
are not binding absolutely by divine law. Where
<i>fundamental law</i> obtains, a portion of the civil power
becomes latent, and only a diminished remainder is
left <i>free</i> in the hands of the person or persons who
are there said to rule. Such person or persons
are not the <i>adequate ruler</i> of the State, as they have
not the full power, but the people, with whom
rests the latent authority to cancel certain laws, are
to that extent partakers in the sovereignty. Where
there is agreement of the whole people, great and
small, no part of the power remains latent, but
all is set <i>free</i>.  With us, it may be observed, the,
omnipotence of parliament has become a mere
lawyer's theory. On every great issue, other than
that on which the sitting parliament has been
elected, it is the practice of ministers to "go to
the country" by a new General Election. Thus
only a certain measure of available authority is free
at the disposal of parliament: the rest remaining,
latent in the general body of the electorate.  Such is
our constitution in practice.<p>

9. If in any State the whole power were free in
the hands of one Man, there we might look to see
made good the dictum of the judicious Hooker
(<i>Ecclesiastical Polity</i>, bk. i., s. x., n. 5): "To live by
one man's will became the cause of all men's
misery." In a monarchy untrammelled by senate
or popular assembly, it were well that some of the
sovereign power should remain latent, and that His
Majesty should rule in accordance with certain laws,
not within his royal pleasure to revoke.<p>

10. The State and the power of the State, apart
from the polity, is of God. (s. iii., n. 14, p. 318.) The
State under this or that polity and this or that ruler,
is also of God. But, apart from the polity, the State
is of God antecedently to any determination of any
human will: because, willy nilly, man must live in civil
society and God commands him so to do. But the
State under this polity and this ruler is of God
consequently to some determination of human volition.
In this consequent sense we write <i>Victoria Dei gratia</i>.<p>

11. There is little use in the enquiry, Which is
the best polity? There is no polity which excels
all other politics as man does the rest of animals.
We judge of polities as of the various types of
locomotives, according to the nature of the country
where the are to run. Aristotle tells us that if we
meet with a Pericles, we shall do best to make him
our king, and hand over all our affairs to him. (Ar.,
<i>Pol</i>. III., xiii., 25: cf.  Thucydides, ii., 65.) 
Otherwise, " for most cities and for most men, apart from
exceptional circumstances, or a condition of ideal
perfection, but having regard to what is ordinarily
possible," he recommends a moderate republic under
middle-class rule. (Ar., <i>Pol</i>., VI., xi., Ed. Congreve.)
This he calls <i>par excellence</i> "a polity," <b>politeia</b>.
<i>Democracy</i>, <b>d&ecirc;mokratia</b>, with Aristotle, always means
that perversion of democracy, which we call <i>mob-rule</i>. 
(Ar., <i>Pol</i>., III., vii., nn. 3, 5.)<p>

12. In the English monarchy the whole majesty
of the State shines forth in the Single Person who
wears the Crown. The Crown is the centre of
loyalty and gives dignity to the government. The
Crown is above all parties in the State, knows their
secrets, their purposes when in office as well as
their acts, and is able to mediate, when party
feeling threatens to bring government to a standstill. 
The British Crown has more weight of influence 
than of prerogatives. [Written in the month and 
year of jubilee, June, 1887.]<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section V. -- <i>Of the Divine Right of Kings and the
Inalienable Sovereignty of the People</i>.</h2>

1. " Those old fanatics of arbitrary power dogmatized 
as if hereditary monarchy were the only lawful
government in the world, just as our new fanatics
of popular arbitrary power maintain that a popular
election is the only lawful source of authority."'
(Burke, Reflections on French Revolution.)<p>

We here stand between two idols of the tribe of
politicians. We may call them Gog and Magog:
Gog, the divine right of kings; Magog, the 
inalienable sovereignty of the people.<p>

2. The position known in history as "the divine
right of kings" may be best described as a <i>political
popedom</i>.  It is the belief of Catholics that our
Divine Redeemer, instituting His Church by His
own personal act as a perfect society and spiritual
commonwealth, instituted in like manner the polity
under which He willed it to be governed, namely,
the Papal monarchy, begun in St. Peter and carried
to completion according to our Lord's design under
the line of Popes, Peter's successors. The monarchy
thus established is essential to the Catholic Church.
We speak not here of the temporal power which
the Pope once enjoyed in the Roman States, but
of his spiritual sovereignty over all Christendom
The Pope cannot validly resign and put out of his
own and his successors' hands, nor can the Cardinals
take away from him, nor the Episcopate, one jot
or tittle of this spiritual prerogative. He cannot, for
instance, condition his infallibility on the consent of
a General Council, or surrender the canonization of
saints to the votes of the faithful at large. Such
are the inalienable, Christ-given prerogatives til the
Papacy. Henry VIII. feloniously set himself up for
Pope within the realm of England.  Blending together
temporal and spiritual jurisdiction, he made out his
rights and prerogatives as a monarch, even in the
civil order, to be inalienable as in the spiritual.
Spiritual and civil attributes together formed a
jewelled circlet, one and indivisible, immoveably
fixed on the brow of the King's Most Sacred
Majesty. Grown and Swollen by their union with
the spirituality, the civil attributes of the Crown
were exaggerated to the utmost, and likewise
declared inalienable. They were exaggerated till
they came to embrace all the powers of government.
The privileges of Parliament, and the limitations
to the royal authority, set forth in the Petition of
Right in 1628, were regarded as mere concessions
tenable at the King's pleasure: from which point
of view we understand the readiness of so 
conscientious a monarch as Charles I. to act against
such privileges after he had allowed them.  But to
vest all the powers of government inalienably in the
King, so that whoever else may seem to partake in
them, shall partake only by royal sufferance, is 
tantamount to declaring monarchy the sole valid and
lawful polity. This declaration the ministers, lay and
clerical, of our Charleses and Jameses do not seem
to have made in express terms. It is, however, 
contained by implication in their celebrated phrase of
"the inalienable prerogatives of the Crown," as 
interpreted by the stretches of prerogative which they
advised. They virtually asserted of one particular
polity, or distribution of civil power (c. viii., s. iii., n. 5,
p. 312), that which is true only of civil power taken
nakedly, apart from the mode of its distribution --
they said of monarchy what is true of government -- that
the sum of its power is a constant quantity (c. viii.,
s. iv., n. 7, p. 322), and that it is of God antecedently
to and irrespectively of any determination of popular
will. (C. viii., s. iv., n. 10, p. 325.)<p>

3. Such a position is easily refuted, negatively, by
its being wholly unproven, unless the English Reformation, 
and the servile spirit in Church and State
that promoted and was promoted by the Reformation, 
can pass for a proof; and again the position
is positively refuted, when we come to consider how
all that nature requires and God commands, is
government under some polity, not government
everywhere under monarchy; there being many
workable polities besides monarchy. (s. iv., nn. 1-4,
p. 319.)<p>

4. The same argument that demolishes Gog,
also overturns Magog. The two idols, opposed to
one another, stand upon the same pedestal, the
identification of government in general with one
particular polity, as though a polity were the polity.
The great assertor and worshipper of the inalienable
sovereignty of the people is Jean Jacques Rousseau.  
He starts from postulates which we have already
rejected -- that all men are equal (c. viii., s. i., n. 9,
p. 305) -- that man is born free (<i>ib</i>., n. 10) -- that none
can be bound to obey another without his own consent 
(<i>ib</i>., n. ii) -- that civil society is formed by an
arbitrary convention (<i>ib.</i>, n. 4.) -- which convention
is the Social Contract. (<i>ib.</i>, n. 5.) From these 
unreasonable postulates Rousseau draws the 
conclusion, logically enough, that the sovereign will
in every State is the will of the majority of the
citizens: but the will of the majority, he goes on,
cannot be alienated from the majority: therefore
neither can the sovereignty be alienated, but must
abide permanently with the people ruling by a
majority of votes.  The argumentation is excellent,
but the premisses are all false.  The conclusion is,
vastly popular, few minds considering from what
premisses it is drawn.<p>

5. If sovereignty rests inalienably with the
people, the one valid polity is pure democracy.
This proposition, however, Rousseau was not
forward to formulate. The Stuarts had shrunk
from formulating a similar proposition about
monarchy, though they virtually held and acted upon,
it. They were willing enough to allow of a parliament, 
whose privileges and functions should be at
His Majesty's gracious pleasure. Thus Rousseau
will allow you to have your senate, king, emperor,
if you will: only remember that he is the prince, not
the sovereign. (<i>Contrat Social</i>, 1. iii., c. i.) The people
collectively are the sovereign, always sovereign.
The Prince, that is, he or they to whom the administration 
is entrusted -- since all the citizens cannot
administer jointly -- is the mere official and bailiff
of the Sovereign People, bound to carry out their
mandate in all things, and removable at their
pleasure. The people must meet periodically, not
at the discretion of the prince. "These meetings
must open with two questions, never to be omitted,
and to be voted on separately. The first is:
Whether it pleases the Sovereign (People) to 
continue the present form of government. The second,
is: Whether it pleases the People to leave the
administration to the persons at present actually
charged with it." (<i>Contrat Social</i>, 1. iv., c. xviii.)<p>

6. The claim of a pure democracy like this to,
supersede all other polities cannot be established
by abstract arguments. That we have seen in
examining the Social Contract.  The alternative
way of establishing such an exclusive claim would
be to prove that the practical efficiency of pure
democracy immeasurably transcends the efficiency
of every other possible polity. There is indeed
yet a third mode of proof resorted to. It is said
that pure democracy everywhere is coming and
must come; and that what is thus on the line of
human progress must be right and best for the time
that it obtains. A grand invention this of Positivist
genius, the theory, that whatever is is right; and,
the practice, always to swim with the stream!
But supposing that pure democracy is coming, how
long is it likely to last? The answer may be
gathered from a review of the working difficulties
of such a polity.<p>

7. It is made only for a small State. Railway
and telegraph have indeed diminished the difficulty; 
and have removed the need of all the
voters meeting in one place, as was done at Athens.
Newspapers echo and spread with addition the 
eloquence of popular orators, beyond the ears that
actually listen to them. Still, think what it would
be to have a general election upon every bill that
passes through Parliament: for that is what pure
democracy comes to. The plan would scarcely
work with a total electorate of thirty thousand.
You say the people would entrust a committee with,
the passing of ordinary measures, reserving to 
themselves the supervision. I am not arguing the
physical impossibility, but the moral difficulties of
such an arrangement For either the people throw
the reins of government on the neck of this committee, 
or they keep a tight hold upon the committee
and guide it. In the former case the popular
sovereignty becomes like that of a monarch who
leans much on favourites, a sovereignty largely
participated in by others than the nominal holder
of the control. On the other hand, if the people do
frequently interfere, and take a lively interest in
the doings of the subordinate assembly, the people
themselves must be a small body. An active
governing body of three hundred thousand members
would be as great a wonder as an active man
weighing three hundred pounds. Only in a small
State is that intense political life possible, which
a pure democracy must live. There only, as
Rousseau requires, can the public service be the
principal affair of the citizens. "All things 
considered," he says, "I do not see how it is any
longer possible for the Sovereign (People) to preserve 
amongst us the exercise of his rights, if the
city is not very small." (<i>Contrat Social</i>, 1. iii., c. xv.)
And the difficulty of size in a democracy is aggravated, 
if, as Socialists propose, the democratic State
is to be sole capitalist within its own limits. The
perfect sovereignty of the people means the disruption 
of empires, and the pushing to extremity
of what is variously described as local government,
home rule, autonomy, and decentralisation, till every
commune becomes an independent State. But for
defence in war and for commerce in peace, these
little States must federate; and federation means
centralisation, external control over the majority at
home, restricted foreign relations, in fact the 
corruption of pure democracy.<p>

8. Again, the perfect sovereignty of the people
cannot subsist except upon the supposition that one
man is as much a born ruler as another, which
means a levelling down of the best talent of the
community, for that is the only way in which
capacities can be equalised -- a very wasteful and
ruinous expedient, and one that the born leaders
of the people will not long endure.  Then there is
the proverbial fickleness of democracy, one day all
aglow, and cooled down the next, never pursuing
any course steadily, in foreign policy least of all,
though there the dearest interests of the State are
often at stake. As one who lived under such a
government once put it: "Sheer democracy is of
all institutions the most ill-balanced and ill put
together, like a wave at sea restlessly tossing before
the fitful gusts of wind: politicians come and go,
and not one of them cares for the public interest
or gives it a thought." (Quoted by Demosthenes
Speech on the Embassy, p. 383 A.) What they do
care for and think of sedulously, is pleasing the
people and clinging to office. In that respect they
are the counterparts of the favourites who cluster
round the throne of a despotic monarch, and suck
up his power by flattering him.  Peoples have their
favourites as well as kings. To these persons, the
Cleon or Gracchus of the hour, they blindly commit
the management of their concerns, as the <i>roi fainant</i>
of old Frankish times left everything to his Mayor of
the Palace, till the Mayor came to reign in his
master's stead; and so has the popular favourite
ere now developed into the military despot. 
Strong-minded kings of course are not ruled by favourites,
nor are highly intelligent and capable peoples: but
it is as hard to find a people fit to wield the power
of pure democracy as to find an individual fit for
an absolute monarch, especially where the State is
large.<p>

9. From all this we conclude that the new-fashioned 
Magog of pure democracy, or the perfect
sovereignty of the people, is not to be worshipped
to the overthrow and repudiation of all other
polities, any more than the old-fashioned Gog of
pure monarchy, idolised by Stuart courtiers under
the name of "the divine right of kings." Neither
of these is <i>the polity</i>: each is <i>a polity</i>, but not one
to be commonly recommended. The study of
polities admirably illustrates the Aristotelian doctrine 
of the Golden Mean (Ethics, c. v., s. iv., p. 77),
teaching us ordinarily to affect limited monarchy or
limited democracy. But as the mean must ever be
chosen in <i>relation to ourselves</i>, a Constantine or an
Athenian Demos may represent the proper polity in
place under extraordinary circumstances.<p>
