<h1>Chapter III: Of Human Acts.</h1>

<hr><p><h2>Section I. -- <i>What makes a human act less voluntary</i>.</h2>

1. See c. i., nn. 2, 3, 4.<p>

2. An act is more or less voluntary, as it is done
with more or less knowledge, and proceeds more or
less fully and purely from the will properly so called.
Whatever diminishes knowledge, or partially supplants 
the will, takes off from the voluntariness of
the act.  <i>An act is rendered less voluntary by ignorance,
by passionate desire, and by fear</i>.<p>

3.  If a man has done something in ignorance
either of the law or of the facts of the case, and
would be sorry for it, were he to find out what he
has done, that act is <i>involuntary</i>, so far as it is
traceable to ignorance alone. Even if he would not
be sorry, still the act must be pronounced <i>not
voluntary</i>, under the same reservation. Ignorance,
sheer ignorance, takes whatever is done under it
out of the region of volition. Nothing is willed but
what is known. An ignorant man is as excusable
as a drunken one, as such, -- no more and no less.
The difference is, that drunkenness generally is
voluntary; ignorance often is not. But ignorance
may be voluntary, quite as voluntary as drunkenness.
It is a capital folly of our age to deny the possibility
of voluntary intellectual error.  Error is often
voluntary, and (where the matter is one that the
person officially or otherwise is required to know)
immoral too. A strange thing it is to say that "it
is as unmeaning to speak of the immorality of an
intellectual mistake as it would be to talk of the
colour of a sound." (Lecky, <i>European Morals</i>, ii.,
202.)<p>

4. There is an ignorance that is sought on
purpose, called <i>affected ignorance</i> (in the Shakspearian
sense of the word <i>affect</i>), as when a man will not
read begging-letters, that he may not give anything
away. Such ignorance does not hinder voluntariness.
It indicates a strong will of doing or omitting, come
what may. There is yet another ignorance called
<i>crass</i>, which is when a man, without absolutely
declining knowledge, yet takes no pains to acquire
it in a matter where he is aware that truth is
important to him. Whatever election is made in
consequence of such ignorance, is less voluntary,
indeed, than if it were made in the full light, still
it is to some extent voluntary. It is voluntary in its
cause, that is, in the voluntary ignorance that led to
it. Suppose a man sets up as a surgeon, having
made a very imperfect study of his art. He is
aware, that for want of knowledge and skill, he
shall endanger many lives: still he neglects 
opportunities of making himself competent, and goes
audaciously to work. If any harm comes of his
bungling, he can plead intellectual error, an error
of judgment for the time being; he did his best as
well as he knew it.  Doubtless he did, and in that
he is unlike the malicious maker of mischief: still
he has chosen lightly and recklessly to hazard a
great evil.  To that extent his will is bound to the
evil: he has chosen it, as it were, at one remove.<p>

5. Another instance.  A man is a long way on
to seeing, though he does not quite see, the claims
of the Church of Rome on his allegiance and submission.  
He suspects that a little more prayer and
search, and he shall be a Roman Catholic. To
escape this, he resolves to go travelling and give up
prayer.  This is <i>affected ignorance</i>.  Another has no
such perception of the claims of Catholicism. He
has no religion that satisfies him. He is aware
speculatively of the importance of the religious
question; but his heart is not in religion at all.
With Demas, he loves the things of this world.
Very attractive and interesting does he find this
life and for the life to come he is content to chance
it. This is <i>crass ignorance</i> of religious truth. Such
a man is not a formal heretic, for he is not altogether
wilful and contumacious in his error. Still neither
is it wholly involuntary, nor he wholly guiltless.<p>

6. <i>Passionate desire</i> is not an affection of the will,
but of the sensitive appetite.  The will may cooperate, 
but the passion is not in the will. The
will may neglect to check the passion, when it
might: it may abet and inflame it: in these ways
an act done in passion is a voluntary act.  Still it
becomes voluntary only by the influx of the will,
positively permitting or stimulating: it is not 
voluntary precisely as it proceeds from passion: for
voluntary is that which is of the will. It belongs
to passion to bring on a momentary darkness in the
understanding: where such darkness is, there is so
much the less of a human act. But passion in an
adult of sane mind is hardly strong enough, of
itself and wholly without the will, to execute any
considerable outward action, involving the voluntary
muscles.  Things are often said and done, and put
down to passion: but that is not the whole account
of the matter.  The will has been for a long time
either feeding the passions, or letting them range
unchecked: that is the reason of their present
outburst, which is voluntary at least in its cause.
Once this evil preponderance has been brought
about, it is to be examined whether the will, in
calm moods, is making any efforts to redress the
evil. Such efforts, if made, go towards making the
effects of passion, when they come, involuntary, and
gradually preventing them altogether.<p>

7. What a man does from fear, he is said to do
<i>under compulsion</i>, especially if the fear be applied
to him by some other person in order to gain
a purpose. Such compulsory action is distinguished
in ordinary parlance from voluntary action.  And
it is certainly less voluntary, inasmuch as the will is
hedged in to make its choice between two evils, and
chooses one or other only as being the less evil of
the two, not for any liking to the thing in itself. Still,
all things considered, the thing is chosen, and the
action is so far voluntary.  We may call it voluntary
in the concrete, and involuntary in the abstract.  The
thing is willed as matters stand, but in itself and
apart from existing need it is not liked at all. But
as acts must be judged as they stand, by what the
man wills now, not by what he would will, an act
done under fear is on the whole voluntary. At the
same time, fear sometimes excuses from the observance 
of a law, or of a contract, which from the
way in which it was made was never meant to bind
in so hard a case. Not all contracts, however, are
of this accommodating nature; and still less, all laws.
But even where the law binds, the penalty of the
law is sometimes not incurred, when the law was
broken through fear.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- <i>Of the determinants of morality in 
any given action.</i></h2>

1. <i>The morality of any given action is determined by
three elements, the end in view, the means taken and the
circumstances that accompany the taking of the said means.</i>
Whoever knows this principle, does not thereby know
the right and wrong of every action, but he knows
how to go about the enquiry. It is a rule of
diagnosis.<p>

2. In order to know whether what a man does
befits him as a man to do, the first thing to examine
is that which he mainly desires and wills in his
action. Now the end is more willed and desired
than the means.  He who steals to commit adultery,
says Aristotle, is more of an adulterer than a thief.
The end in view is what lies nearest to a man's heart
as he acts. On that his mind is chiefly bent; on
that his main purpose is fixed. Though the end is
last in the order of execution, it is first and foremost
in the order of intention. Therefore the end in view
enters into morality more deeply than any other
element of the action. It it not, however, the most
obvious determinant, because it is the last point to
be gained; and because, while the means are taken
openly, the end is often a secret locked up in the
heart of the doer, the same means leading to many
ends, as the road to a city leads to many homes
and resting-places. Conversely, one end may be
prosecuted by many means, as there are many roads
converging upon one goal.<p>

3. If morality were determined by the end in
view, and by that alone, the doctrine would hold
that the end justifies the means. That doctrine is
false, because the moral character of a human act
depends on the thing willed, or object of volition,
according as it is or is not a fit object.  Now the
object of volition is not only the end in view, but
likewise the means chosen. Besides the end, the
means are likewise willed.  Indeed, the means are
willed more immediately even than the end, as they
have to be taken first.<p>

4. A good action, like any other good thing, must
possess a certain requisite fulness of being, proper to
itself. As it is not enough for the physical excellence 
of a man to have the bare essentials, a body
with a soul animating it, but there is needed a
certain grace of form, colour, agility, and many
accidental qualities besides; so for a good act it is
not enough that proper means be taken to a proper
end, but they must be taken by a proper person, at
a proper place and time, in a proper manner, and
with manifold other circumstances of propriety.<p>

5. The end in view may be either single, as when
you forgive an injury solely for the love of Christ:
or <i>multiple co-ordinate</i>, as when you forgive both for
the love of Christ and for the mediation of a friend,
and are disposed to forgive on either ground separately; 
or <i>multiple subordinate</i>, as when you would
not have forgiven on the latter ground alone, but
forgive the more easily for its addition, having
been ready, however, to forgive on the former
alone: or <i>cumulative</i>, as when you forgive on a
number of grounds collectively, on no one of which
would you have forgiven apart from the rest.<p>

6. Where there is no outward action, but only
an internal act, and the object of that act is some
good that is willed for its own sake, there can be no
question of means taken, as the end in view is
immediately attained.<p>

7. The means taken and the circumstances of
those means enter into the morality of the act,
<i>formally</i> as they are seen by the intellect, <i>materially</i>
as they are in themselves. (See what is said of
ignorance, c. iii., s. i. nn. 3-5, p. 27.), This explains
the difference between <i>formal</i> and <i>material</i> sin. A
<i>material</i> sin would be <i>formal</i> also, did the agent know
what he was doing. No sin is culpable that is not
<i>formal</i>.  But, as has been said, there may be
culpable perversion of the intellect, so that the man is
the author of his own obliquity or defect of vision.
When Saul persecuted the Christians, he probably
sinned materially, not formally. When Caiphas
spoke the truth without knowing it, he said well
materially, but ill formally.<p>

8. In looking at the means taken and the circumstances 
that accompany those means, it is important
to have a ready rule for pronouncing what particular
belongs to the means and what to the circumstances.  
Thus Clytemnestra deals her husband Agamemnon
a deadly stroke with an axe, partly for revenge,
partly that she may take to herself another consort;
is the deadliness of the blow part of the means
taken or only an accompanying circumstance?
It is part of the means taken. The means taken
include every particular that is willed and chosen as
making for the end in view. The fatal character of
the blow does make to that end; if Agamemnon
does not die, the revenge will not be complete, and
life with Aegisthus will be impossible. On the other
hand, the fact that Clytemnestra is the wife of the
man whom she murders, is not a point that her will
rests upon as furthering her purpose at all; it is an
accompanying circumstance. This method of distinguishing 
means from circumstance is of great value
in casuistry.<p>

9. It is clear that not every attendant circumstance 
affects the morality of the means taken.
Thus the blow under which Agamemnon sank was
neither more nor less guiltily struck because it was
dealt with an axe, because it was under pretence of
giving him a bath, or because his feet were entangled
in a long robe. These circumstances are all irrelevant.
Those only are relevant which attach some special
reasonableness or unreasonableness to the thing done
Thus the provocation that Clytemnestra had from
her husband's introduction of Cassandra into her
house made her act of vengeance less unreasonable:
on the other hand it was rendered more unreasonable
by the circumstance of the dear and holy tie that binds
wife to husband. The provocation and the relationship 
were two relevant circumstances in that case.<p>

10. But it happens sometimes that a circumstance 
only affects the reasonableness of an action
on the supposition of some previous circumstance so
affecting it. Thus to carry off a thing in large or
small quantities does not affect the reasonableness of
the carrying, unless there be already some other
circumstance attached that renders the act good or
evil; as for instance, if the goods that are being
removed are stolen property.  Circumstances of this
sort are called <i>aggravating</i> --  or, as the case may be,
<i>extenuating</i> -- circumstances. Circumstances that of
themselves, and apart from any previous supposition,
make the thing done peculiarly reasonable or unreasonable, 
are called <i>specifying</i> circumstances. They
are so called, because they place the action in
some species of virtue or vice; whereas <i>aggravating</i>
or <i>extenuating</i> circumstances add to, or take off
from, the good or evil of the action in that species
of virtue or vice to which it already belongs.<p>

11. A variety of specifying circumstances may
place one and the same action in many various
species of virtue or vice. Thus a religious robbing
his parents would sin at once against justice, piety,
and religion. A nun preferring death to dishonour
practises three virtues, chastity, fortitude, and
religion.<p>

12. The means chosen may be of four several
characters: --<p>

(a) A thing <i>evil of itself</i> and inexcusable under
all conceivable circumstances; for instance, blasphemy, 
idolatry, lying.<p>

(b) <i>Needing excuse</i>, as the killing of a man, the
looking at an indecent object. Such things are not
to be done except under certain circumstances and
with a grave reason.  Thus indecent sights may be
met in the discharge of professional duty.  In that
case indeed they cease to be indecent. They are
then only indecent when they are viewed without
cause. The absence of a good motive in a case like
this commonly implies the presence of a bad one.<p>

(c)<i>Indifferent</i>, as walking or sitting down.<p>

(d)<i>Good of itself</i>, but liable to be vitiated by
circumstances, as prayer and almsgiving; the good
of such actions may be destroyed wholly or in part
by their being done out of a vain motive, or unseasonably, 
or indiscreetly.<p>

13. It is said, "If thy eye be single, thy whole
body shall be lightsome." (St. Matt. vi., 22.) The
eye is the intention contemplating the end in view.  
Whoever has placed a good end before him, and
regards it steadily with a well-ordered love, never
swerving in his affection from the way that reason
would have him love, must needs take towards his
end those means, and those only, which are in 
themselves reasonable and just: as it is written "Thou
shalt follow justly after that which is just." (Deut.
XVI., 20.) Thus I am building a church to the glory
of God; money runs short: I perceive that by
signing a certain contract that must mean grievous
oppression of the poor, I shall save considerable
expense, whereas, if I refuse, the works will have to
be abandoned for want of funds. If I have purely
the glory of God before my eyes, I certainly shall
not sign that contract: for injustice I know can bear
no fruit of Divine glory.  But if I am bent upon
having the building up in any case, of course I shall
sign: but then my love for the end in view is no
longer pure and regulated by reason: it is not God
but myself that I am seeking in the work. Thus an
end entirely just, holy, and pure, purifies and sanctifies 
the means, not formally, by investing with a
character of justice means in themselves unjust,
for that is impossible, -- the leopard cannot change
his spots, -- but by way of elimination, removing
unjust means as ineligible to my purpose, and
leaving me only those means to choose from which
are in themselves just.<p>

14. With means in themselves indifferent, the
case is otherwise. A holy and pious end does
formally sanctify those means, while a wicked end
vitiates them. I beg the reader to observe what sort
of means are here in question. There is no question
of means in themselves or in their circumstances
unjust, as theft, lying, murder, but of such 
indifferent things as reading, writing painting, singing,
travelling.  Whoever travels to commit sin at the
end of his journey, his very travelling, so far as it is
referred to that end, is part of his sin: it is a wicked
journey that he takes. And he who travels to
worship at some shrine or place of pilgrimage,
includes his journey in his devotion. The end in
view there sanctifies means in themselves indifferent.<p>

15. As a great part of the things that we do are
indifferent as well in themselves as in the 
circumstances of the doing of them, the moral character of
our lives depends largely on the ends that we
habitually propose to ourselves. One man's great
thought is how to make money; what he reads,
writes, says, where he goes, where he elects to
reside, his very eating, drinking and personal expenditure, 
all turns on what he calls making his fortune.  
It is all to gain money -- <i>quocunque modo rem</i>. Another
is active for bettering the condition of the labouring
classes: a third for the suppression of vice. These
three men go some way together in a common orbit
of small actions, alike to the eye, but morally unlike,
because of the various guiding purposes for which
they are done. Hence, when we consider such
pregnant final ends as the service of God and the
glory of a world to come, it appears how vast is the
alteration in the moral line and colouring of a man's
life, according to his practical taking up or setting
aside of these great ends.<p>

16. We must beware however of an exaggeration
here. The final end of action is often latent, not
explicitly considered.  A fervent worshipper of God
wishes to refer his whole self with all that he does
to the Divine glory and service.  Yet such a one
will eat, drink, and be merry with his friends, not
thinking of God at the time. Still, supposing him
to keep within the bounds of temperance, he is
serving God and doing good actions. But what of
a man who has entirely broken away from God,
what of his eating, drinking, and other actions that
are of their kind indifferent? We cannot call them
sins: there is nothing wrong about them, neither in
the thing done, nor in the circumstances of the
doing, nor in the intention.  Pius V. condemned the
proposition "All the works of infidels are sins."
Neither must we call such actions indifferent in the
individual who does them, supposing them to be
true human acts according to the definition, and not
done merely mechanically. They are not indifferent,
because they receive a certain measure of natural
goodness from the good natural purpose which they
serve, namely, the conservation and well-being of
the agent. <i>Every human act is either good or evil in
him who does it</i>.  I speak of natural goodness only.<p>

17. The <i>effect consequent</i> upon an action is 
distinguishable from the action itself, from which it is not
unfrequently separated by a considerable interval of
time, as the death of a man from poison administered 
a month before. The effect consequent enters
into morality only in so far as it is either chosen
as a means or intended as an end (nn. 2, 3, p. 31),
or is annexed as a relevant circumstance to the
means chosen (n. 9, p. 34.). Once the act is done,
it matters nothing to morality whether the effect
consequent actually ensues or not, provided no new
act be elicited thereupon, whether of commission
or of culpable omission to prevent. It matters
not to morality, but it does matter to the agent's
claim to reward or liability to punishment at
the hands of human legislators civil and 
ecclesiastical.<p>

18. As soul and body make one man, so the
inward and outward act -- as the will to strike and
the actual blow struck -- are one human act. The
outward act gives a certain physical completeness
to the inward. Moreover the inward act is no
thorough-going thing, if it stops short of outward
action where the opportunity offers. Otherwise,
the inward act may be as good or as bad morally
as inward and outward act together. The mere
wish to kill, where the deed is impossible, may
be as wicked as wish and deed conjoined. It
may be, but commonly it will not, for this reason,
that the outward execution of the deed reacts
upon the will and calls it forth with greater
intensity; the will as it were expands where it
finds outward vent. There is no one who has
not felt the relative mildness of inward feelings
of impatience or indignation, compared with those
engendered by speaking out one's mind. Often
also the outward act entails a long course of 
preparation, all during which the inward will is
sustained and frequently renewed, as in a carefully
planned burglary.<p>
