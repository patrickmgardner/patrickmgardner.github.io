<h1>Chapter X. Of Utilitarianism</h1>

1. THOUGH the name <i>utilitarian</i> is an English growth
of this century, the philosophy so called probably
takes its origin from the days when man first began
to speculate on moral matters. Bentham and the
two Mills, Austin, and George Grote, have repeated
in England the substance of what Protagoras and
Epicurus taught in Greece, two thousand years
before. It is the system of Ethics to which all
must incline, who ignore the spiritual side of man's
nature and his hopes of a better world.  It is a
morality of the earth, earthy.<p>

2. Utilitarianism has not been formulated like
the Athanasian Creed. It is impossible to state it
and combat it in a form to which all Utilitarians
will subscribe. Indeed, it is an amiable weakness of
theirs, when confronted with the grosser consequences 
that flow from their theories, to run off to
some explanation, true enough, but quite out of
keeping with the primary tenets of their school.
We will take what may be called a "mean reading "
of the indications which various Utilitarian thinkers
afford of their mind and philosophy.  These authorities, 
then, teach two main heads of doctrine:<p>

(1) That the last end and final good of man
lies in this world, and consists in the greatest 
happiness of the greatest number of mankind, happiness
being taken to mean pleasure as well of the senses
as of the understanding, such pleasure as can be
had in this world, along with immunity from pain.
(Mill's <i>Utilitarianism</i>, 2nd Ed., pp. 9. seq.)<p>

(2) That human acts are <i>right</i> or <i>wrong</i>, according 
as they <i>useful</i> or <i>hurtful</i>, that is, according as
their consequences make for or against the above-mentioned 
end of social happiness.<p>

3. Consequences, as Utilitarians very properly
point out, are either <i>general</i> or <i>particular</i>.  They add
that, in pronouncing an action to be good or evil
according to its consequences, they mean the
general and not the particular consequences. In
other words, they bid us consider, not the immediate
results of <i>this action</i>, but what would be the result to
society, if <i>this sort of action</i> were generally allowed.  
This point is well put by Paley (<i>Moral Philosophy</i>,
bk. ii., c. vii.: all three chapters, vi., vii., viii., should
be read, as the best explanation of the Principle of
General Consequences):<p>

<blockquote>
"You cannot permit one action and forbid
another, without showing a difference between
them. Consequently the same sort of actions
must be generally permitted or generally forbidden.  
Where, therefore, the general permission of them
would be pernicious, it becomes necessary to lay
down and support the rule which generally forbids
them. . . . The assassin knocked the rich villain
on the head, because he thought him better out of
the way than in it. If you allow this excuse in the
present instance, you must allow it to all who act in
the same manner, and from the same motive; that
is, you must allow every man to kill any one he
meets, whom he thinks noxious or useless: . . . a
disposition of affairs which would soon fill the world
with misery and confusion, and ere long put an end
to human society."
</blockquote><p>

My contention is, not with the Principle of
General Consequences, which has a certain value
in Ethics, and is used by many writers other than
Utilitarian, but with the two stated above, n. 2,
which are called the Greatest Happiness Principle
and the Principle of Utility.<p>

4.     Against the Greatest Happiness Principle I
have these complaints:<p>

(1) Utilitarians from Paley to John Stuart Mill
aver that their teaching is no bar to any man hoping
for and striving after the happiness of the world to
come.  They say that such happiness cannot be
better attained than by making it your principal
aim to improve all temporal goods and dissipate
all temporal evil. Their maxim in fact is: 'Take
care of the things of earth, and the things of
heaven will take care of themselves.' Whereas it
was the very contrary teaching of Him, whom
moderns, who see in Him no higher character, still
love to call the greatest of moral teachers: "That
which fell among thorns are they who have heard,
and going their way, are choked with the cares and
riches and pleasures of this life, and yield no fruit."
(St.  Luke viii. 14.)<p>

(2) It will be said that these thorns grow of selfishness, 
and that these cares are the cares of individual
interest, whereas the Utilitarian's delight and glory is
to live, not for himself, but for the commonwealth.  
But how can a man, who takes pleasure to be his
highest good and happiness, live otherwise than for
himself? Here we come upon the unobserved fault
and flaw, which entirely vitiates the Utilitarian
structure. It is an union of two opposite and 
incompatible elements.  An old poet has said

<ul><ul>
Vinegar and oil in one same vessel pour,<br>
They stand apart, unfriendly, all the more.<br>
(AEschylus, <i>Agam.</i>, 330, 331.)
</ul></ul><p>

Utilitarianism consists of a still more unfriendly
and unwholesome mixture of two elements, both of
them bad, and unable to stand together, Hedonism
and Altruism.  Hedonism is the doctrine that the
main object and end of life is pleasure: which is the
position laid down in so many words by Mill (l. c.),
that "actions are right in proportion as they tend
to promote happiness;" and "by happiness is intended 
pleasure and the absence of pain." If
Hedonism were sound doctrine, the Pleasant and
the Good would be identical, and the most pleasant
pleasure would ever be the best pleasure. That
would take away all distinction of kind or quality
among pleasures, and differentiate them only by
intensity and duration. This was Paley's doctrine,
a fundamental point of Hedonism, and therefore also
of the Utilitarian philosophy. John Mill, very 
honourably to himself, but very fatally to the system that he
was writing to defend, parted company with Paley.<p>

We have argued against Paley (c. iv., s. iii., nn. 3-5,
p. 55), that there is a better and a worse in pleasures,
quite distinct from the more or less pleasurable, even
if that more be taken in the long run in this world.
Again it may be considered that pleasure, even
the best and highest, is a sort of efflorescence
from activity, and is for activity, not activity for
it; and better is the activity, whatever it be, than
the pleasure which comes thereof; wherefore no
pleasure, as pleasure, can be the highest good and
happiness of man.<p>

Hedonism then is an error.  But errors may be
opposed to one another as well as to the truth.
Hedonism is opposed to Altruism in this way. A
man may take pleasure in seeing other people enjoy
themselves.  Nothing is more common, except the
pleasure taken in enjoying one's own self. But if a
man only feeds the hungry that he may have the
satisfaction of seeing them eat, is it the hungry or
himself that he finally seeks to gratify? Clearly,
himself.  That is the behaviour of the Hedonist, he
acts for his own pleasure even in his benevolence.  
The Altruist, on the contrary, professes never to act
for self, but for society.  So that society flourish, he
is ready to be crushed and ruined, not in the matter
of his pleasure only, but even in that of his own
good. Selfishness, by which he means all manner
of regard to self, is, upon his conscience, the unforgiven 
sin. But Hedonism is selfishness in the
grossest form, being the mere pursuit in all things of
pleasurable feeling -- feeling being always particular
and limited to self, in contradistinction to good,
which is universal and diffuses itself all round. The
Hedonist seeks his own pleasure, where the Altruist
forbids him to take thought, let alone for his 
gratification, but even for his good.  Thus an Hedonist
cannot be Altruist to boot; and, trying to combine
the two characters, the Utilitarian is committed to a
self-contradiction.<p>

If he relinquishes Hedonism, and holds to Altruism,
pure and simple, his position is not much improved.
Altruism overlooks the fact, that man, as compared
with other men, is a <i>person</i>, the centre of his own
acts, not a <i>thing</i>, to be entirely referred to others.  
He is in relation with others, as child, father,
husband, master, citizen; but these relations do not
take up the whole man.  There is a residue within, --
an inner being and life, which is not referable to any.
creature outside himself, but only to the Creator.  For
this inner being, man is responsible to God alone.
The good of this, the "inner man of the heart," is
each individual's proper and primary care. Altruism,
and Utilitarianism with it, ignore the interior life
of the soul, and substitute human society, that is,
ultimately, the democratic State, in place of God.<p>

(3) Another confusion that the Greatest Happiness 
Principle involves, is the mistaking the political
for the ethical end of life. The political end, which
it is the statesman's business to aim at, and the
citizen's duty to subserve, is "the natural happiness
of the commonwealth, and of individuals as members
of the commonwealth, that they may live in it in
peace and justice, and with a sufficiency of goods for
the preservation and comfort of bodily life, and with
that amount of moral rectitude which is necessary
for this outward peace and preservation of the 
commonwealth, and the perpetuity of the human race."
(Suarez, <i>De Legibus</i>, III., xi., 7.) This is all the good
that the Utilitarian contemplates. He is satisfied to
make a good <i>citizen</i>, a good <i>husband</i>, a good <i>father</i>,
for the transactions of this life.  He has no concern
to make a good <i>man</i> up to the ethical standard,
which supposes the observance of the whole natural
law, duties to God, and duties within himself, as well
as duties to human society, and by this observance
the compassing of the everlasting happiness of the
man's own individual soul.<p>

Against the Principle of Utility I find these
charges:<p>

(1) It takes the sign and indication of moral evil
for the evil itself, as if the physician should take the
symptom for the disease.  It places the wickedness
of an act in the physical miscry and suffering that
are its consequences. This is, I say, a taking of the
indication for the thing indicated.  An act is bad in
itself and by itself, as being a violation of the rational
nature of the doer (c. vi., s. i.), and being bad, it
breeds bad consequences. But the badness of the
act is moral; the badness of the consequences, 
physical. There is an evident intrinsic irrationality,
and thereby moral evil, in such sins as intemperance,
peevishness, and vanity.  But let us take an instance
of an act, apparently harmless in itself, and evil
solely because of the consequences.  Supposing one
insists upon playing the piano for his own amusement, 
to the disturbance of an invalid who is lying
in a critical state in the next room. Do the mere
consequences make this otherwise innocent amusement 
evil? Yes, if you consider the amusement in
the abstract: but if you take it as this human act, the
act is inordinate and evil in itself, or as it is elicited
in the mind of the agent.  The volition amounts to
this: 'I prefer my amusement to my neighbour's
recovery,' which is an act unseemly and unreasonable
in the mind of a social being. Utilitarians fall into
the capital error of ignoring the intrinsic value of
an act, and estimating it wholly by extrinsic results,
because they commonly follow the phenomenalist
philosophy, which breaks away from all such ideas
as <i>substance</i> and <i>nature</i>, and regards nothing but
sequences and coexistences of phenomena.  To a
phenomenalist the precept, <i>Live up to thy nature</i>, can
have no meaning.<p>

Aristotle (<i>Ethics</i>, II., iv., 3) draws this 
distinction between virtue and art, that "the products of
art have their excellence in themselves: it suffices
therefore that they are of this or that quality: but
acts of virtue are not done virtuously according to
the quality of the thing done, but according to the
state of mind of the doer; first, according to his
knowledge of what he was about; then, according
to his volition, as that was guided or not guided
by the proper motives of the virtue; thirdly, 
according to the steadiness and fixedness of his will;
whereas all these considerations are of no account
in a work of art, except the single one of the artist
being aware of what he was about." Elsewhere
(<i>Ethics</i>, VI., iv., 2), he says that virtue is distinguished
from art as being <i>action</i>, not <i>production</i>. The Principle 
of Utility confounds virtue with art, or perhaps
I should say, with manufactures. It judges conduct,
as one would shoemaking, by trial of the product,
or net result. So far from being solicitous, with
Aristotle, that volition should be "guided by the
proper motives of the virtue" which there is question
of practising (c. v., s. viii., n. 4, p. 96: Ar. <i>Eth</i>., III.,
viii.), Mill (<i>Utilitarianism</i>, p. 26) tells us that 
"utilitarian moralists have gone beyond almost all others
in affirming that the motive has nothing to do with
the morality of the action." By <i>motive</i> he understands 
what we have called <i>the end in view</i>. (c. iii.,
s. ii., n. 2, p. 31.) So that, if one man waits on the
sick for the love of God, and another in hope of a
legacy, the morality of these two acts is the same,
just as it makes no difference to the usefulness of a
pair of boots, what motive it was that set the 
shoemaker to work. True, Mill admits that the motive
has "much to do with the worth of the agent:"
but that, he hastens to explain, is inasmuch as "it
indicates . . . a bent of character from which useful,
or from which hurtful actions are likely to arise."
Even so, -- the shoemaker who works to earn money
for a carousal, is not likely to go on producing
useful articles so long as another, who labours to
support his family. Such is the moral difference
that Mill places between the two men; one instrument 
of production is longer available than the
other.<p>

(3) Another well established distinction is that
between <i>harm</i> and <i>injury</i>, injury being wilful and
unjust harm. The housemaid, who in arranging the
room has burned your manuscript of "sugared
sonnets," has done you no injury, for she meant
none, but how vast the harm to the author and to
mankind! Harm is visible in the effects: but injury
only upon examination of the mind of the agent.
Not so, however, the Utilitarian thinks: harm being
equal, he can make no difference between a tyrant
and a man-eating tiger.  Thus George Grote says of
a certain murderous usurper of the kingdom of
Macedon: " You discover nothing while your eye
is fixed on Archelaus himself. . . . But when you
turn to the persons whom he has killed, banished,
or ruined -- to the mass of suffering that he has
inflicted -- and to the widespread insecurity which
such acts of iniquity spread through all societies
where they become known -- there is no lack of 
argument which prompts a reflecting spectator to brand
him as [a most dangerous and destructive animal,
no], a disgraceful man." (Grote's <i>Plato</i>, ii., p. 108.)
Why Archelaus is described in terms of the tiger,
and then branded as a disgraceful man, we are at a
loss to conceive, except in this way, that the writer's
philosophy forsook him at the end of the sentence,
and he reverted to the common sense of mankind.  
But he should have either ended the sentence as
suggested in the parenthesis, or have been willing to
call the man-eater of the Indian jungle, who has
"learned to make widows, and to lay waste their
cities," a disgraceful tiger; or lastly, he should have
looked back, where he declared it was vain to
look, upon Archelaus himself, and discerned in him
that moral deformity, and contradiction of reason,
whereof a brute beast is incapable, but which is a
disgrace and a stain upon humanity.<p>

A later writer, who presses Utilitarianism into the
service of Socialism, is plainer-spoken than Grote,
and says bluntly: "To be  honestly mistaken avails
nothing.  Thus Herbert Spencer -- who is under the
delusion that we have come into this world each for
the sake of himself, and who opposes, as far as he
can, the evolution of society -- is verily an immoral
man. . . . Right is every conduct which tends 
to the welfare of society; wrong, what obstructs
that welfare." (Gronlund, <i>Co-operative Commonwealth</i>,
pp. 226, 227.) This is overlaid the difference
between harm and injury, between physical and
moral evil: thus is the meaning of a <i>human act</i>
ignored: in the abyss of chaos and confusion 
which Utilitarianism has opened out, Moral Philosophy
finds her grave.<p>

(4) The Principle of Utility sees in virtue a habit
of self-sacrifice, useful to the community, but not
naturally pleasant, and therefore not naturally good
and desirable, to him that practises it, but made
pleasurable and good and desirable to him by
practice. (Mill, pp. 53-57.) In this way virtue
becomes naturally a very good thing for every one
else but its possessor, but to him it is a natural evil,
inasmuch as it deprives him of pleasure, which
natural evil by habit is gradually converted into a
factitious and artificial good, the man becoming
accustomed to it, as the proverb says, "like eels to
skinning." This theory is the resuscitation of one
current among the Sophists at Athens, and described
by Plato thus. -- The natural good of man is to afford
himself every indulgence, even at the expense of his
neighbours. He follows his natural good accordingly: 
so do his neighbours follow theirs, and try to
gratify themselves at his expense. Fights ensue,
till mankind, worried and wearied with fighting,
make a compact, each to give tip so much of his
natural good as interferes with that of his neighbour.
Human society, formed on this understanding, enforces 
the compact in the interest of society. Thus
the interest of society is opposed to the interest of
the individual, in this that it keeps him out of his
best natural good, which is to do as his appetite of
pleasure bids him in all things, though it compensates
him with a second-class good, by preventing his
neighbours from pleasure-hunting at his expense.
If then his neighbours could be restrained, and he
left free to gratify himself, that would be perfect
bliss. But only a despot here or there has attained
to it. The ordinary man must pay his tax of virtue
to the community, a loss to him, but a gain to all
the rest: while he is compensated by the losses
which their virtue entails upon them.
Such was the old Athenian theory, which John
Mill, the Principle of Utility in his hand, completes
by saying that by-and-bye, and little by little (as the
prisoner of Chillon came to love his dungeon), the
hampered individual comes to love, and to find an
artificial happiness in, those restrictions of his
liberty, which are called Virtue.<p>

It was against this theory that Plato wrote his
<i>Republic</i>, and, to compare a little thing to a great,
the whole account of moral good being in consonance
with nature, and of moral obligation rising out of the
nature of the individual man, as has been set forth
in this brief Text-book, may serve for a refutation
of the perverse doctrine of Utilitarianism.<p>
