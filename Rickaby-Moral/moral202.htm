<h1>Chapter II. On the Duty of Preserving Life.</h1>

<hr><p><h2>Section I. -- <i>Of Killing, Direct and Indirect</i>.</h2>

1. IN a hilly country, two or three steps sometimes
measure all the interval between the basins of two
rivers, whose mouths are miles apart.  In the crisis
of an illness the merest trifle will turn the scale
between death and recovery. In a nice point of law
and intricate procedure, the lawyer is aware that
scarcely more than the thickness of the paper on
which he writes lies between the case going for his
client or for the opposite party. To rail at these
fine technicalities argues a lay mind, unprofessional
and undiscerning. <i>Hair-splitting</i>, so far as it is a
term of real reproach, means splitting the wrong
hairs. The expert in any profession knows what
things to divide and distinguish finely, and what
things to take in the gross. Moral Science in many
respects gives its demonstrations. and can give them,
only "in the way of rough drawing," as Aristotle
says. (<b>pachul&ocirc;s kai tup&ocirc;</b>, 
<i>Ethics</i>, I., iii., 4.) But there
are lines of division exceeding fine and nice in
natural morality no less than in positive law. The
student must not take scandal at the fine lines and
Subtle distinctions that we shall be obliged to draw
in marking off lawful from unlawful action touching
human life.<p>

2. <i>It is never lawful directly to kill an innocent man</i>.
Understand innocent in the social and political sense,
of a man who has not, by any <i>human act</i> (<i>Ethics</i>, c. i.,
n. 2, p. 1) of his own, done any harm to society so
grievous as to compare with loss of life. To kill, or
work any other effect, <i>directly</i>, is to bring about that
death, or other effect, willing the same, <i>either as an
end desirable in itself</i>, as when a man slays his enemy,
whose death of its own sheer sake is to him a satisfaction 
and a joy, or <i>as a means to an end</i>, as Richard
III. murdered his nephews to open his own way to
the throne. We must then in no case compass the
death of the innocent, either <i>intending</i> it as an <i>end</i>,
or <i>choosing</i> it as a <i>means</i>.  The assertion is proved
by these considerations. To kill a man is to destroy
the human nature within him: for, though the soul
survives, he is man no more when he is dead. Now
to destroy a thing is to subordinate that thing entirely
to your self and your own purposes: for that individual 
thing can never serve any other purpose, once
it is destroyed. The man that is killed is then 
subordinated to the slayer, wholly given up, and as we
say, <i>sacrificed</i>, to the aims and purposes of him who
slays him. But that ought not to be, for man is a
<i>person</i>.  Body and soul in him make one person, one
personal nature, which human personality is destroyed
in death. Now it is the property of a person to be
what we may call <i>autocentric</i>, referring its own 
operations to itself as to a centre.  Every <i>person</i> -- and
every intelligent nature is a person [The exception apparent 
in the Incarnation is not relevant here.] -- exists and acts
primarily for himself. A <i>thing</i> is marked off from a
<i>person</i> by the aptitude of being another's and for
another. We may venture to designate it by the
term <i>heterocentric</i>. A person therefore may destroy
a thing, entirely consume and use it up for his own
benefit. But he may not treat a person as a thing
and destroy that, either for any end of pleasure that
he finds in destroying it, or in view of any gain or
good, whereunto that destruction serves him as a
means.<p>

3. In the above argumentation account has not
been taken of God, to whom for His sovereign 
dominion all created personalities stand in the light
of <i>things</i>, and may be destroyed at His pleasure.  
But account has been taken of the State, to which
the individual is subordinate as a citizen, but not as
a man and a person.  It is permitted no more to
the State than to the individual ever to destroy the
innocent <i>directly</i>.<p>

4. An effect is brought about <i>indirectly</i> when it
is neither <i>intended</i> as an <i>end</i> for its own sake, not
<i>chosen</i> as a <i>means</i> making towards an end, but
attaches as a circumstance concomitant either to
the end intended or to the means chosen.  The case
of a circumstance so attaching to the means chosen
is the only case that we need consider here in speaking 
of <i>indirect, concomittant</i>, or <i>incidental</i> effects. The
study of these incidents is of vast importance to the
moralist. Most cases of practical difficulty to decide
between right and wrong, arise out of them. They
are best illustrated in the manner of killing.  That one
matter, well worked out, becomes a pattern for other
matters in which they occur. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. iii., s. ii., p. 31.)<p>

5. A man is killed <i>indirectly</i>, or <i>incidentally</i>, when
he perishes in consequence of certain means employed 
towards a certain end, without his death
being willed by the employer of those means, or in
any way serving that agent to the furtherance of the
end that he has in view. If a visitor to a quarry
were standing on a piece of rock, which a quarryman
had occasion to blast, and the man fired the train
regardless of the visitor, the latter would be 
incidentally killed.  Now incidental killing, even of the
innocent, is not under all circumstances unlawful.
Where the end in view is in the highest degree 
important, the means may be taken thereto, provided
always that such an issue as the shedding of innocent
blood be not itself the means discerned and elected as
furthering the end: for no end however urgent can
justify the employment of any evil means. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. iii.,
s. ii., nn. 3, 13, pp. 32, 36.) Suppose in the instance
just given the quarryman saw that, unless that piece of
rock where the visitor stood were blown up instantly,
a catastrophe would happen elsewhere, which would
be the death of many men, and there were no time
to warn the visitor to clear off, who could blame him
if he applied the explosive? The means of averting
the catastrophe would be, not that visitor's death,
but the blowing up of the rock. The presence or
absence of the visitor, his death or escape, is all one
to the end intended: it has no bearing thereon at all.<p>

6. We must then distinguish between <i>means</i> and
<i>circumstances</i>. The means help to the end, the 
circumstances of the means do not.  When the end is
of extreme urgency, circumstances may be disregarded: 
the means become morally divested of them.  
So I have seen an island in a river, a nucleus of rock
with an environment of alluvial soil.  While the
stream was flowing placidly in its usual course, the
island remained intact, both rock and earth. But
when the water came rushing in a flood, which was
as though the island itself had gone speeding up the
river, the loose matter at its sides was carried away,
and only the central rock remained.  The ordinary
flow of the river past the island, or the gentle motion
of the island up-stream, keeping all its bulk, represents 
a man acting for an end to which reason
attaches no great importance.  He must then take
a diligent review of all the circumstances that have
any close connection with his action, to see if there
is any that it would be wrong for him to will directly.  
And if there is, he must abstain from willing it even
indirectly: that is, he must abstain from doing the
action, which cannot be done without that objectionable 
circumstance attending it.  On the other hand,
the floating island being towed rapidly upstream,
with its loose sides falling away, portrays the 
condition of one acting for a purpose of imperative
urgency: he considers the means to that end, and
if they are good, he concentrates his will upon them
and uses them, disregarding, or even deploring, but
nowise willing or being responsible for, the evil 
concomitants which go with those means, but do not
make for his end.  Thus it is, that a circumstance
which in ordinary cases goes to make the adoption
Of certain means reasonable or unreasonable, comes,
in a case of great urgency, to weigh for nothing in
the balance of reason, owing to the extreme and
crying reasonableness of the end in view.  Nor is
this the end justifying the means, for that unhappy
circumstance is never a means to the end. (<i>Ethics</i>,
c. iii., s. ii., n. 8, p. 34.)<p>

7. To illustrate by a diagram:
<ul><ul>
          UC<br>
          |<br>
          |_________________________________ EV<br>
          A
</ul></ul><p>

A, the <i>agent</i>, a bead on a wire, can move only on
the line A E, that alone being the line of means to
the end.<p>

E V, <i>reasonableness of end in view</i>, attracting A.<p>

U C, the amount of moral evil which the <i>untoward 
circumstance</i>, would involve, if it were willed
directly. This U C repels A, tending to jam it on
the line A E, which is absolutely rigid.<p>

A E, remoteness, difficulty, and uncertainty of
the end in view.<p>

A U, remoteness of untoward circumstance from
means chosen, which A is just in the act of taking.
Then, for lawful action, the reasonableness required
in the end in view is represented by the variation --<p>
<pre>            UC . AE
     EV ~~ _________

              AU
</pre>

We observe that when AU is zero, while UC . AE
remains a finite quantity (representing an appreciable 
evil), then EV becomes infinite: that is to
say, when the distance, difference, or distinction
between the evil circumstance and the means comes
down to nothing at all, and the evil thing actually 
is the very means taken, then an infinite urgency of
end in view would be requisite to justify the using
of that means. in other words, no end possible to
man can ever justify an evil means.<p>

de Lugo, <i>De Justitia et Jure</i>, disp. 10, n. 125.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- <i>Of Killing done Indirectly in 
Self-defence</i>.</h2>

1. On the question, whether it is lawful for one
man to kill another in self-defence, St. Thomas
writes (2a 2ae, q. 64, art. 7):<p>

"There is nothing to hinder one act having two
effects, of which one only is within the intention [and
election] of the doer, while the other is beside his
intention [and election, that is, is neither intended as
an end nor elected as a means] . . . . From the act
therefore of one defending himself a twofold effect
may follow, one the preservation of his own life, the
other the killing of the aggressor.  Now such an act,
in so far as the preservation of the doer's own life is
intended, has no taint of evil about it, seeing that it
is natural to everything to preserve itself in being
as much as it can.  Nevertheless, an act coming of
a good intention may be rendered unlawful, if it be
not in proportion to the end in view.  And therefore,
if any one uses greater violence than is necessary
for the defence of his life, it will be unlawful.  But if
he repels the violence in a moderate way, it will be
a lawful defence: for according to the Civil and
Canon Laws it is allowable to repel force by force
with the moderation of a blameless defence. Nor is it
necessary to salvation for a man to omit the act of
moderate defence in order to avoid the killing of
another; because man is more bound to take thought
for his own life than for the life of his neighbour.
But because to kill a man is not allowable except by
act of public authority for the common good, it is 
unlawful for a man to intend [that is, elect and choose
as a means] to kill another man in order to defend
himself, unless he be one who has public authority,
who intending [electing] to kill a man in order to
his own defence, refers this to the public good."<p>

2. The right then of self-defence even to the
shedding of blood involves a mere exercise of indirect
killing for a proportionably grave cause. The cause
in question is the defence of your own life, or your
friend's, or of some other good or possession that can
weigh with life, as the honour and inviolability of
your person, or a large sum of money. This must
be in present danger of being taken away otherwise
than in due course of justice. The danger must be
present, and even imminent, not prospective. The
right of self-defence even to the grievous harming of
the aggressor, endures only while the danger from
him is imminent, not when it is past, or the evil is
already done. The right supposes no moral obliquity, 
no formal injustice on the part of the
aggressor: he may be a madman making for you
with a drawn sword. Nay further, not even <i>material</i>
injustice -- that is, the quality of an act which would
be <i>formally</i> unjust, if only the agent knew what he
was about -- is required. All that is requisite is
that your life, or something equivalent to life, be
threatened, not in due course of law.<p>

3. The essential idea of self-defence is that of
stopping a trespasser, one who, however innocently,
is going about to trench on that good which you have
a right to maintain and reserve to yourself. It is
then no act of authority that you perform, but the
dealing of one private person with another. Indeed,
the party stopped is hardly regarded as a person:
no account is taken of his demerits: he is regarded
simply as an abridger and diminisher of what you
have a right to preserve intact. You stop a man as
you stop a horse, only with more regard to the
moderation of a blameless self-defence, not using more
violence than is necessary here and now to preserve
what you have to preserve.<p>

4. The stopping, unfortunately, has often to be
done in a hurry: there is no time to wait: for the
next moment, unless you act promptly, it will be all
too late, or all to no purpose, to act at all. Being
done in a hurry, it has to be done in a rough-and-ready 
way, with such instruments as are to hand:
you cannot afford to be nice about the means, 
carefully purifying them, and shaking off the dust of
objectionable circumstances. Now to stop a man
in mid career all on a sudden, to render him powerless 
where he was about to strike, motionless in the
direction whither he was about to go, and that in an
instant, is of common necessity a rude treatment,
very dangerous to him who experiences it, and under
some conceivable, circumstances hopelessly fatal.
Still the fatality -- in plain words, the death of the
aggressor -- is not <i>directly willed</i>.  It is neither 
<i>intended</i> as an <i>end</i>, nor <i>chosen</i> 
as a <i>means to an end</i>.  It
is not welcomed as an end and desirable consummation: 
on the contrary, it is put up with most reluctantly 
as coming from your act: for you, a private
individual, have no right to will and effect the death
of any man, however guilty, as will be proved hereafter.  
It is not chosen as a means: for, formally as
his death, it is no means to your end, which was the
averting of all present danger to your right.  For
that it was enough to <i>stop</i> the trespasser; and you
chose the means as a <i>stopping</i> means, not as a <i>killing</i>
means. True, in stopping him you killed him, but
you did not kill him to stop him.  You struck him
to stop him: that your blow was a mortal blow, was
a circumstance which you did not choose and could
not help.  All killing then in self-defence is 
indirect.<p>

5. By this explanation, resting on St. Thomas -- in
opposition to Cardinal de Lugo (<i>De Just. et Jure.</i> 10,
149) and others, who allow killing in self-defence to be
the actual means chosen, and therefore directly willed
-- we save four grand positions in Moral Science:<p>

(a) The axiom, that <i>it is never lawful directly to
take the life of an innocent man</i>. For the person who
perishes by occasion of your defending yourself, may
be innocent formally, and even materially also.<p>

(b) Likewise the axiom, that <i>it is never lawful for
a private individual to kill any one whatever</i>. We say,
from a technical standpoint, that he does not <i>kill</i>
but <i>arrests the onset of</i> the aggressor.<p>

(c) We are in hearty accord with the positive law
of all civilized countries, which views with extreme
suspicion all deaths said to be done in self-defence,
the law being jealous of the blood of its citizens, and
reserving the shedding thereof to itself. We teach
that only by process of law can a man ever be
directly slain, his death made a means of, and the
person, who strikes him, really willing and seeking,
exactly speaking, to kill him.<p>

(d) The initial error is revealed of a theory that
we shall have to combat at length hereafter, the
theory of Hobbes and Locke, that the power of the
State is the mere agglomeration of the powers of
the individuals who compose it. It appears by
our explanation that the individual has no power
strictly to take life in any case, or ever to kill
directly, as the State does when it executes a
criminal.<p>

 As a fifth point gained, we may mention the
efficacious argument afforded, as will presently be
shown, against the acceptance of a duel under any
conceivable circumstances, a thesis otherwise not
easy to establish by reason.<p>

6. In view of the question of the origin of civil
government, we must carefully collect the differences
between self-defence and punishment. Death occasioned 
in self-defence is <i>indirect</i>: death inflicted as
punishment is <i>direct</i>. Punishment is an act of
<i>authority</i>, of <i>distributive justice</i>, which lies from ruler
to subject (<i>Ethics</i>, c. v., s. ix., n. 4, p.104): self-defence
is of equal against equal. Punishment is <i>medicinal</i> to
him who suffers it, or <i>deterrent</i> on behalf of the 
community, or <i>retributive</i> in the way of vengeance.  
(<i>Ethics</i>, c. ix., s. iii., n. 4.) Self-defence is not on
behalf of the community, still less for the good of
the aggressor, but for the good of him who practises
it and for the preservation of his right: neither is it
retributive and retrospective, as vengeance is, but
simply prospective and preventive of a harm immediately 
imminent.  Finally, the right. to punish
abides day and night: but the right of self-defence
holds only while instant aggression is threatened.<p>

7. These two diverse ideas of self-defence and
vengeance were confounded by the Greeks under the
one verb <b>amunesthai</b>. They are confounded by Mill, <i>On
Utility</i>, in the fifth chapter where he speaks (p. 77)
of the "instinct of self-defence," which nine lines
below he converts into "the natural feeling of 
retaliation or vengeance." It is a common but a grave
mistake, and the parent of much bad philosophy.<p>

<i>Readings</i>. -- St. Thos., 2a 2ae, q. 64, art. 7.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section III. -- <i>Of Suicide</i>.</h2>

1. By suicide we shall here understand the <i>direct
compassing of one's own death</i>, which is an act never
lawful.  There is no difficulty in seeing the unlawfulness 
of suicide for ordinary cases. The world could
not go on, if men were to kill themselves upon every
slight disappointment.  But neither are they likely
so to do. It is the hard cases, where men are apt
to lay violent hands on themselves, that put the
moralist on his mettle to restrain them by reasons.
Why should not the solitary invalid destroy himself,
he whose life has become a hopeless torture, and
whose death none would mourn?  Why should not
a voluntary death be sought as an escape from 
temptation and from imminent sin?  Why should not the
first victims of a dire contagion acquiesce in being
slaughtered like cattle? Or if it be deemed perilous
to commit the departure from life to each one's
private whim and fancy, why not have the thing
licensed under certificate of three clergymen and
four doctors, who could testify that it is done on
good grounds?<p>

2. To all these questions there is one good answer
returned by Paley on the principle of General Consequences.
(<i>Ethics</i>, c. x., n. 3, p. 178.)<p>

"The true question of this argument is no other
than this: May every man who chooses to destroy 
his life, innocently do so?  Limit and distinguish
the subject as you can, it will come at last to this
question.  For, shall we say that we are then at
liberty to commit suicide, when we find our
continuance in life becomes useless to mankind?  
Anyone who pleases, may make himself useless; and
melancholy minds are prone to think themselves
useless when they really are not so. . . . In like
manner, whatever other rule you assign, it will
ultimately bring us to an indiscriminate toleration of
suicide, in all cases in which there is danger of its
being committed.  It remains, therefore, to enquire
what would be the effect of such a toleration: evidently,
the loss of many lives to the community, of
which some might be useful or important; the affliction
of many families, and the consternation of all:
for mankind must live in continual alarm for the fate
of their friends, when every disgust which is powerful
enough to tempt men to suicide, shall be deemed 
sufficient to justify it."  (<i>Moral Philosophy</i>,
bk. iv., c. iii.)<p>

A word in confirmation of Paley on the plan of
the medico-clerical certificate.  There would be
doctors, and I fear clergymen too, who would get a
name for giving these certificates easily: under their
hand many a patient might be smothered by his
attendants with or without his own consent. Many
another wretch would consider, that if the learned
and reverend gentlemen empowered to license his
departure from life only felt what he had to endure,
there would be no difficulty about the certificate: so
be would depart on presumed leave. The whole
effect would be to make men less tender of their
own lives, and by consequence of those of others, to
the vast unsettling of society.<p>

3. An argument from general consequences, however, 
does not go down into the depths of things.
There is always something morally crooked and inordinate 
in an action itself, the general consequences
whereof are bad. It remains to point out the moral
crookedness, inordination, and unreasonableness,
that is intrinsic to the act of suicide, apart from its
consequences.  We find the inordination in this,
that suicide is an act falling upon undue matter,
being an act destructive of that which the agent has
power over only to preserve. It is natural to every
being, animate and inanimate, to the full extent of its
entity and power, to maintain itself, and to resist
destruction as long as it can. This is the struggle
for existence, one of the primary laws of nature.
Man has intelligence and power over himself, that
he may conduct his own struggle well and wisely.
He may struggle more or less, as he sees expedient,
looking to higher goods even than self-preservation
in this mortal life: but he may not take that power
of managing himself, which nature invests him with
for his preservation, and use it to his own destruction. 
Should he do so, he perverts the natural order
of his own being, and thereby sins. (<i>Ethics</i>, 
c. vi., s. i., nn.  1-5, p. 109.)<p>

4. It may be objected, that man is only bound
to self-preservation so long as life is a blessing; that,
when the scale of death far outweighs that of life in
desirableness, it is cruelty to himself to preserve his
life any longer, and a kindness to himself to destroy
it; that in such a plight, accordingly, it is not 
unnatural for a man to put himself, not so much out
of life as out of misery. To this argument it is
sometimes answered that, whereas death is the
greatest of evils, it is foolish and wicked to resort to
dying as a refuge against any other calamity. But
this answer proves too much. It would show that
it is never lawful even to wish for death: whereas
under many conditions, such as those now under
consideration, death is a consummation devoutly to
be wished, and may be most piously desired, as a
gain and by comparison a good: as Ecclesiasticus
says (xxx. 17): "Better is death than a bitter life,
and everlasting rest than continual sickness." The
truth seems to be, that there are many things highly
good and desirable in themselves, which become evil
when compassed in a particular way. The death of
a great tyrant or persecutor may be a blessing to the
universe, but his death by the hand of an assassin
is an intolerable evil. So is death, as the schoolmen
say, <i>in facto esse</i>, and everlasting rest, better than a
bitter life, but not death <i>in fieri</i>, when that means
dying by your own hand. There the unnaturalness
comes in and the irrationality.  A mother, watching
the death agony of her son, may piously wish it over --
but it were an unmotherly act to lay her own hand
on his mouth and smother him. To lay violent
hands on oneself is abidingly cruel and unnatural,
more so than if the suicide's own mother slew him.<p>

5. But though a man may not use actual violence
against his own person, may he not perhaps cease
to preserve himself, abstain from food, as the Roman
noble did, in the tortures of the gout, and by
abstaining end them? I answer, a man's taking
food periodically is as much part of his life as the
coursing of the blood in his veins. It is doing
himself no less violence to refuse food ready to
hand, when he is starving, on purpose that he may
starve, than to open a vein on purpose to bleed to
death. This, when the food is readily accessible:
the case is otherwise when it is not procurable
except by extraordinary means.<p>

6. Another consideration. To destroy a thing
is the exclusive right of the owner and master of
the same. If therefore man is his own master, in
the sense that no one else can claim dominion over
him, may he not accordingly destroy himself? The
metaphysician will point out that <i>master</i> denotes a
relation, that every relation has two terms, that
consequently a man cannot be his own master any
more than he can be his own father; and that, not
owning himself, he may not destroy himself. But,
leaving this metaphysical argument for what it is
worth, we observe that man has a Master, Owner,
Proprietor, and Sovereign Lord, God Almighty.  To
take your own life is to usurp the dominion of God.  
It is wronging the Lord of life and death. But
none is wronged against his will: God is willing
that murderers should be hung, may He not also
be willing that men in misery should bang themselves? 
To this query suffice it for the present
to reply, that God governs us for our good; and
that capital punishment makes for the good of the
community, but never suicide. (c. viii., s. viii., n. 7,
p. 349.)<p>

7. It was the doctrine of Aristotle and the
Greeks, that the citizen belongs to the State, and
that therefore suicide was robbing the State and
doing it a formal injury. But no modern State
takes this view of its subjects. No modern mind
would place suicide in the same category of crime
with robbing the Exchequer.<p>

8. The great deterrent against suicide, in cases
where misery meets with recklessness, is the thought,

<blockquote>
In that sleep of death what dreams may come I! --
</blockquote><p>

above all, the fear of being confronted with an angry
God.  Away from belief in God's judgments and a
future state, our arguments against suicide may be
good logic, but they make poor rhetoric for those
who need them most. Men are wonderfully imitative 
in killing themselves. Once the practice is
come in vogue, it becomes a rage, an epidemic.  
Atheism and Materialism form the best <i>nidus</i> for
the contagion of suicide. It is a shrewd remark
of Madame de Stael: "Though there are crimes of
a darker hue than suicide yet there is none other
by which man seems so entirely to renounce the
protection of God."<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section IV. -- <i>Of Duelling</i>.</h2>

1. A duel may be defined: A meeting of two
parties by private agreement to fight with weapons
in themselves deadly. The meeting must be <i>by
agreement</i>: a chance meeting of Montagues and
Capulets, where the parties improvise a fight on the
spot is not a duel. The agreement must be <i>private</i>.
Anything arranged by public authority, as the encounter 
of David with Goliath, that in the legend
of the Horatii and Curiatii, or the <i>wager of battle</i>
in the Middle Ages is not a duel. It is enough that
the weapons be <i>in themselves deadly</i>, as swords or
pistols, though there be an express stipulation not
to kill: but a pre-arranged encounter with fists, with
foils with buttons on, or even perhaps with crab-sticks, 
is not a duel.<p>

2. The hard case in duelling is the case of him
who receives the challenge. Let us make the
case as hard as possible. In a certain army,
every challenge sent to an officer is reported to
a Court of Honour. If the Court decide that it
ought to be accepted, accept the officer must, or
lose his commission and all hope of military 
distinction. In this army, say, there is an officer of
high promise who is believed to object to duels
on conscientious grounds. An enemy pretends to
have been insulted, and challenges him, on purpose
to see him refuse and have to go down into the
ranks, his career spoilt. The Court of Honour
rules that the duel must come off. Of this very
case, Reiffenstuel, a canonist of repute, about the
year 1700, writes:<p>

"The answer is, that they who in such cases
are so necessitated and constrained to offer, or
accept, a duel, as that unless they offered, or accepted
it, they would be held cowardly, craven, mean, and
unfit to bear office in the army, and consequently
would be deprived of the office that they actually
enjoy, and support themselves and their family by,
or would for ever forfeit all hope of promotion,
otherwise their due and desert, -- these I say in
such a case are free from all fault and penalty,
whether they offer or accept a duel." (In lib. v.
decret., tit. 14, nn. 30, 31.)<p>

The author protests in his Preface that he
wishes his opinions "all and each to be subject to
the judgment, censure, and correction of the Holy
Catholic Church." The opinion above quoted was
condemned, word for word as it was uttered, by
Pope Benedict XIV. in 1752.<p>

Now for Reiffenstuel's reason. "The reason,"
he says, "is, because in such a case as is supposed
the acceptance and offering of a duel is an absolutely
necessary, and thereby a just and lawful, defence of
your reputation, or goods of fortune, and, by equivalence, 
even of your life, against an unjust aggressor,
who we suppose does you an injury, and thereby
gives you no choice but to call him out, or calls
you out, and accordingly assails you in words, &c.
Hence, as for the needful defence of reputation, or
of goods of fortune of great consequence, it is lawful, 
with the moderation of a blameless defence, to
kill an unjust aggressor, so it will be also lawful to
offer and accept a duel, and therein slay the other
party." Reiffenstuel here evidently supposes that
killing done in self-defence is direct. Those who
agree with him on that point, proceed to draw differences 
between self-defence and accepting a challenge.  
Of course the two are not the same. The true
difficulty for them lies in making out how the
reasons which justify self-defence in their view of it,
do not also justify the acceptance of a duel: how, if
I may make another man's death a means to the
preservation of my vital right, I may not as well
make another man's risk of death and my own,
which is all that a duel amounts to, also a means,
none other being at hand, to the preserving of my
no less vital right. This grave objection does not
touch us.  We have denied that killing in self-defence 
is direct. On the lines of that denial we
meet Reiffenstuel's argument simply as follows.<p>

In self-defence, the aggressor is slain indirectly.
In a duel, not indeed the death itself, or mutual
slaughter of the combatants, is directly willed, but
the risk of mutual slaughter is directly willed.  But
we may not directly will the risk of that which we
may not directly do. And the combatants may not
directly do themselves or one another to death.
Therefore they may not directly risk each his own
and his antagonist's life. But this risk is of the
essence of a duel. Therefore duelling is essentially
unlawful.<p>

4. Such is the clenched fist, so to speak, of our
argument. Now to open it out, and prove in detail
the several members. In self-defence, neither the
death of the aggressor nor the risk of his death
is directly willed, whereas the risk of death is
directly willed in a duel, which difference entirely
bars the argument from self-defence to duelling.
For a duel is a means of recovering and preserving
honour, which is effected by a display of fortitude,
which again consists in exposing yourself to the
risk of being killed, and, as part of the bargain,
of killing the other man. The risk to life is of
the essence of a duel: it only attains its end --
of establishing a man's character for courage -- by
being dangerous to life.  Fortitude essentially 
consists in braving death. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. v., s. viii., 
n. 1, p. 94.) Deadly weapons, chosen because they are deadly
and involve a risk of life in fighting with such arms,
are the apt and express means for showing readiness 
to brave death. If the weapons were not
deadly, there would be no point in the duel. As a
matter of fact, where our definition of duel is verified, 
and weapons in themselves deadly are used,
the encounter cannot be other than dangerous,
especially between foes and where the blood is up.
In the French army, where the regimental fencing-master 
stands by, sword in hand, ready to parry
any too dangerous thrust, serious results still have
occurred. If any man will have it that short smooth-bore 
pistols at forty paces in a fog are not to be
counted dangerous weapons, all we can say is that
MM. Gambetta and De Fourton, the one being
nearly blind, and the other having lost an eye, did
not fight a duel. In a duel then the danger of
being killed and of killing is <i>directly</i> willed; it is the
precise <i>means chosen</i> to the end in view.<p>

5. We have proved already that it is not lawful
directly to procure one's own death, nor the death
of another innocent man. If any one contends that
his antagonist is not innocent, not even in a <i>political</i>
sense (c. ii., s. i., n. 2, p. 203), we must here assume
against him, what we shall afterwards prove, that
the guilty are not to be directly put to death except
by public authority. But what we may not directly
bring about, we may not directly risk the occurrence
of. As I may not throw myself down a cliff, so
neither may I walk along the edge precisely for the
chance of a fall. I may often walk there with the
chance of falling, but not <i>because</i> of the chance. It
will be said that the English love of fox-hunting
and Alpine climbing is largely owing to the element
of danger present in those amusements. But it is
not the danger pure and simple, that is chosen for
amusement: it is the prospect of overcoming
danger by skill. The same may be said of Blondin
on the tight-rope: it was his skill, not his mere risk,
that was admired. There are some risks that no
skill can obviate, as those of Alpine avalanches.  
We may face a mountain slope where avalanches
occur, but we must not hang about there because of
the avalanches, making our amusement or bravado
of the chance of being killed. That would be
willing the risk of death directly, as it is willed in
duelling.<p>
