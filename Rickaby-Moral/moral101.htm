<h1>Chapter I: Of the Object-Matter and Partition of Moral Philosophy</h1>

1.  Moral Philosophy is the science of human acts in their bearing on 
human happiness and human duty.<p>

2.  Those acts alone are properly called <i>human,</i> which a man is 
master of to do or not to do. A <i>human act,</i> then, is an act 
voluntary and free. A man is what his human acts make him.<p>

3.  A <i>voluntary</i> act is an act that proceeds from the will with a 
knowledge of the end to which the act tends.<p>

4.  A free act is an act which so proceeds from the will that under the 
same antecedent conditions it might have not proceeded.<p>

An act may be more or less voluntary, and more or less free.<p>

5.  Moral Philosophy is divided into Ethics, Deontology, and Natural 
Law. Ethics consider human acts in their bearing on human happiness; 
or, what is the same thing, in their agreement or disagreement with 
man's rational nature, and their making for or against his last end.  
Deontology is the study of moral obligation, or the fixing of what 
logicians call the comprehension of the idea <i>I ought</i>.  Ethics 
deal with <b>to deon</b>, 'the obligatory'.  Deontology is the science 
of Duty, as such.  Natural Law (antecedent to Positive Law, whether 
divine or human, civil or ecclesiastical, national or international) 
determines duties in detail, -- the <i>extension</i> of the idea <i>I 
ought</i>, -- and thus is the foundation of Casuistry.<p>

6. In the order of sciences, Ethics are antecedent to Natural Theology; 
Deontology, consequent upon it.<p>
