<h1>Chapter VI: Of the Origin of Moral Obligation.</h1>
<hr><p><h2>Section I. -- <i>Of the natural difference between 
Good and Evil</i>.</h2>

1. A GRANITE boulder lying on an upland Moor
stands indifferently the August sun and the January
frost, flood and drought.  It neither blooms in
spring, nor fades in autumn. It is all one to the
boulder whether it remain in the picturesque solitude 
where the glacier dropped it, or be laid in the
glitter of a busy street. It has no growth nor
development: it is not a subject of evolution: there
is no goal of perfection to which it is tending by
dint of inward germinal capacity seconded by 
favourable environment. Therefore it does not matter
what you do with it: all things come alike to that
lump of rock.<p>

2. But in a cranny or cleft of the same there is
a little flower growing. You cannot do what you
will with that flower. It has its exigencies and
requirements. Had it a voice, it could say, what
the stone never could: 'I must have this or that:
I must have light, I must have moisture, a certain
heat, some soil to grow in.' There is a course to
be run by this flower and the plant that bears it,
a development to be wrought out, a perfection to
be achieved. For this end certain conditions are
necessary, or helpful: certain others prejudicial, or
altogether intolerable. In fact, that plant has a
<i>progressive nature</i>, and therewith is a subject of
good and evil. Good for that plant is what favours
its natural progress, and evil is all that impedes it.<p>

3. All organic natures are progressive: that is,
each individual of them is apt to make a certain
progress, under certain conditions, from birth to
maturity.  But man alone has his progress in any
degree in his own hands, to make or to mar.  Man
alone, in the graphic phrase of Appius Claudius, is
<i>faber fortunatae suae</i>, "the shaper of his own destiny."
Any other plant or animal, other than man, however
miserable a specimen of its kind it finally prove to
be, has always done the best for itself under the 
circumstances; it has attained the limit fixed for it by
its primitive germinal capacity, as modified by the
events of its subsequent environment. The miserable 
animal that howls under your window at night,
is the finest dog that could possibly have come of
his blood and breeding, nurture and education. But
there is no man now on earth that has done all for
himself that he might have done.  We all fall short
in many things of the perfection that is within our
reach. Man therefore needs to stir himself, and to
be energetic with a free, self-determined energy to
come up to the standard of humanity. It is only
his free acts that are considered by the moralist.  
Such is the definition of Moral Science, that it deals
with <i>human acts</i>; acts, that is, whereof man is master
to do or not to do. (c. i., nn. i, 2.)<p>

4. We have it, then, that a morally good act is
an act that makes towards the progress of human
nature in him who does it, and which is freely done,
Similarly, a morally evil act is a bar to progress, or
a diversion of it from the right line, being also a
free act. Now, that act only can make for the
progress of human nature, which befits and suits
human nature, and suits it in its best and most
distinctive characteristic. What is best in man,
what characterises and makes man, what the old
schoolmen called the <i>form</i> of man, is his reason.
To be up to reason is to be up to the standard of
humanity. Human progress is progress on the lines
of reason. To make for that progress, and thereby
to be morally good, an act must be done, not blindly,
brutishly, sottishly, or on any impulse of passion,
however beneficial in its effects, but deliberately, and
in conscious accordance with the reasonable nature
of the doer.<p>

5. Whatever be man's end and highest good, he
must go about to compass it reasonably. He must
plan, and be systematic, and act on principle. For
instance, if the public health be the highest good, the
laws which govern it must be investigated, and their
requirements carried out, without regard to sentiment. 
If pleasure be the good, we must be artists
of pleasure. If, however, as has been seen (c. ii.)
the highest good of man is the highest play of reason
herself in a life of contemplation, to be prepared
for, though it cannot be adequately and worthily
lived, in this world, then it is through following
reason, through subjecting appetite to reason by
temperance, and the will to reason by justice, and
reason herself by a "reasonable service" to God,
that this end and consummation must be wrought
out. Thus, in Plato's phrase (<i>Rep.</i>, 589 B), the
moral man acts so that "the inner man within him,
the rational part of his nature, shall be strongest;
while he watches with a husbandman's care over the
many-headed beast of appetite, rearing and training
the creature's tame heads and not letting the wild
ones grow; for this purpose making an ally of the
lion, the irascible part of his nature, and caring for
all the parts in common, making them friends to one
another and to himself." In this way he will meet
the true exigency of his nature as a whole, with due
regard to the proper order and subordination of the
arts. He who lives otherwise, acts in contradiction
to his rational self. (c. v., s. iii., n. 3, P. 74).<p>

6. The result of the above reasoning, if result it
has, should be to explain and justify the Stoic rule,
<i>naturae convenienter vivere</i>, to live according to nature.  
But some one will say: 'That is the very ideal of
wickedness: all good in man comes of overcoming
nature, and doing violence to natural cravings:
live according to nature, and you will go straight
to the devil.' I answer: 'live according to a part of
your nature, and that the baser and lower, though
also the more impetuous and clamorous part, and
you will certainly go where you say: but live <i>up
to the whole of your nature</i>, as explained in the last
paragraph, and you will be a man indeed, and will
reach the goal of human happiness.' But again it
may be objected, that our very reason, to which the
rest of our nature is naturally subordinate, frequently
prompts us to do amiss. The objection is a just
one, in so far as it goes upon a repudiation of the old
Platonic position, that all moral evil comes of the
body, wherein the soul is imprisoned, and of the
desires which the body fastens upon the soul.  Were
that so, all sins would be sins of sensuality. But
there are spiritual sins, not prompted by any lust
or weakness of the body, as pride and mutiny, 
self-opiniatedness, rejection of Divine revelation. The
objection turns on sins such as these. The answer
is, that spiritual sins do not arise from any exigency
of reason, but from a deficiency of reason; not from
that faculty calling upon us, as we are reasonable
men, to take a certain course, in accordance with a
just and full view of the facts of the case, but from
reason failing to look facts fully in the face, and
considering only some of them to the neglect of
others, the consideration of which would alter the
decision.  Thus a certain proud creature mentioned
in Scripture thought of the magnificence of the
throne above the stars of God, on the mountain of
the covenant, on the sides of the north: he did not
think how such a pre-eminence would become him
as a creature.  He had in view a rational good
certainly, but not a rational good for him. Partial
reason, like a little knowledge, is a dangerous thing.<p>

7. As it is not in the power of God to bring it
about, that the angles of a triangle taken together
shall amount to anything else than two right angles,
so it is not within the compass of Divine omnipotence 
to create a man for whom it shall be a good
and proper thing, and befitting his nature, to
blaspheme, to perjure himself, to abandon himself
recklessly to lust, or anger, or any other passion.
God need not have created man at all, but He could
not have created him with other than human exigencies. 
The reason is, because God can only create
upon the pattern of His own essence, which is
imitable, outside of God, in certain definite lines of
ability.  These possibilities, founded upon the
Divine essence and discerned by the Divine intelligence, 
are the Archetype Ideas, among which the
Divine will has to choose, when it proceeds to create.  
The denial of this doctrine in the Nominalist and
Cartesian Schools, and their reference to the 
arbitrary will of God of the eternal, immutable, and
absolutely necessary relations of possible things, is
the subversion of all science and philosophy.<p>

8. Still less arc moral distinctions between good
and evil to be set down to the law of the State, or
the fashion of society.  Human convention can no
more constitute moral good than it can physical
good, or mathematical or logical truth. It is only
in cases where two or more courses are tolerable,
and one of them needs to be chosen and adhered to
for the sake of social order, that human authority
steps in to elect and prescribe one of those ways of
action, and brand the others as illegitimate, which
would otherwise be lawful. This is called the
making of a positive law.<p>

<i>Readings</i>. -- St. Thos., 1a 2ae, q. 18, art. 5, in
corp.; 1a 2ae, q. 71, art. 2 Plato, <i>Rep.</i>, 588 B to
end of bk. ix. Ar., <i>Eth.</i>, IX., iv., nn. 4-10; Suarez,
<i>De Legibus</i>, II., vi., nn. 4, II; Cicero, <i>De Legibus</i>, 
i., cc. 15-17.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- <i>How Good becomes bounden Duty, and Evil
is advanced to Sin</i>.</h2>

1. The great problem of Ethics is the explanation 
of the idea, <i>I ought</i>. (c. i., n. 6.) We are now
come close up to the solution of that problem. The
word <i>ought</i> denotes the necessary bearing of means
upon end.  To every <i>ought</i> there is a pendent <i>if</i>. 
The means <i>ought</i> to be taken, <i>if</i> the end is to be
secured.  Thus we say: 'You <i>ought</i> to start betimes,
if you are to catch your train.' 'You ought to
study harder, if you are to pass your examination.'
The person spoken to might reply: 'But what if I
do miss my train, and fail in my examination?' He
might be met with another <i>ought</i>: 'You ought not
to miss the one, if you are to keep your appointment: 
or to fail in the other, if you are to get into
a profession.' Thus the train of <i>oughts</i> and <i>ifs</i>
extends, until we come finally to a concatenation
like the following: 'You <i>ought</i> not to break your
word, or to give needless pain to your parents, if you
don't want to do violence to that nature which is
yours as a reasonable being,' or 'to thwart your own
moral development,' -- and so on in a variety of
phrases descriptive of the argument of the last section.  
were it seems the chain is made fast to a staple in
the wall.  If a person goes on to ask, 'Well, what
if I do contradict my rational self?' -- we can only
tell him that he is a fool for his question.  The
<i>oughts</i>, such as those wherewith our illustration
commenced, Kant calls the <i>hypothetical imperative</i>,
the form being, 'You must, unless:' but the ought
wherein it terminated, he calls the <i>categorical 
imperative</i>, the alternative being such as no rational man
can accept, and therefore no alternative at all.<p>

2. This doctrine of the Categorical Imperative is
correct and valuable so far as it goes. But then it
does not go far enough. The full notion of what a
man <i>ought</i>, is what he <i>must do under pain of sin</i>. Sin
is more than folly, more than a breach of reason.  
It is mild reproach to a great criminal to tell him
that he is a very foolish person, a walking unreasonableness. 
If he chooses to contradict his rational
self, is not that his own affair? Is he not his own
master, and may he not play the fool if he likes?
The answer is, 'No, he is not his own master; he
is under law, and his folly and self-abuse becomes
criminal and sinful, by being in contravention of the
law that forbids him to throw himself away thus
wantonly.'<p>

3. Kant readily takes up this idea, shaping it
after his own fashion.  He contends, -- and herein
his doctrine is not merely deficient, but positively in
error, -- that the Categorical Imperative, uttered by a
man's own reason, has the force of a law, made by
that same reason; so that the legislative authority
is within the breast of the doer, who owes it obedience.  
This he calls the autonomy of reason.  It is
also called Independent Morality, inasmuch as it
establishes right and wrong without regard to
external authority, or to the consequences of actions,
or to rewards and punishments. The doctrine is
erroneous, inasmuch as it undertakes to settle the
matter of right and wrong without reference to
external authority; and inasmuch as it makes the
reason within a man, not the promulgator of the
law to him, but his own legislator.  For a law is a
precept, a command: now no one issues precepts, or
gives commands, to himself. To command is an act
of jurisdiction; and Jurisdiction, like justice (see c. v.,
s. ix., n. 1, p. 102) requires a distinction of persons,
one ruler, and another subject.  But the reason in a
man is not a distinct subject from the will, appetites,
or other faculties within him, to which reason
dictates: they are all one nature, one person, one
man ; consequently, no one of them can strictly
be said to command the rest; and the dictate of
reason, as emanating from within oneself, is not a
law. But without a law, there is no strict obligation. 
Therefore the whole theory of obligation is
not locked up in the Categorical Imperative, as
Kant formulated it.<p>

4. The above argumentation evinces that God is
not under an law; for there is no other God above
Him to command Him. As for the ideas of what is
meet and just in the Divine intelligence, though the
Divine will, being a perfect will, is not liable to act
against them, yet are those ideas improperly called
a law to the Divine will, because intellect and will
are identified in one God.  Kant's doctrine makes
us all gods. It is a deification of the human intellect,
and identification of that intellect with the supreme
and universal Reason; and at the same time a
release of the human will from all authority
extraneous to the individual. This amounts to
a putting off of all authority properly so called, and
makes each man as sovereign and unaccountable as
his Maker.  " Thy heart is lifted up, and thou hast
said: I am God, and sit in the chair of God: and
hast set thy heart as if it were the heart of God
whereas thou art a man and not God. (Ezech.
xxviii. 2.) Kant is thus the father of the pantheistic
school of Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel.<p>

5. But it has been contended that this phrase
about a man who does wrong breaking a law, is only
a metaphor and figure of speech, unless it be used
with reference to the enactment of some civil community. 
Thus John Austin says that a natural law
is a law which is not, but which he who uses the
expression thinks ought to be made. At this rate
sin is not a transgression of any law, except so far
as it happens to be, in the lawyer's sense of the
word, a crime, or something punishable in a human
court of justice. There will then be no law but
man's law. How then am I obliged to obey man's
law? Dr. Bain answers: " Because, if you disobey,
you will be punished." But that punishment will be
either just or unjust: if unjust, it originates no
obligation: if just, it presupposes an obligation, as
it presupposes a crime and sin, that is, an obligation
violated. There seems to be nothing left for John
Austin but to fall back upon Kant and his Categorical 
Imperative, and say that whoever rebels
against the duly constituted authority of the State in
which he lives, is a rebel against the reason that
dwells within his own breast, and which requires
him to behave like a citizen.  So that ultimately it
is not the State, but his own reason that he has
offended; and the State has no authority over him
except what his own reason gives.<p>

6. If this were true, there would be no sin anywhere 
except what is called <i>philosophical sin</i>, that is,
a breach of the dignity of man's rational nature;
and the hardest thing that could be said in reprobation 
of a wrongdoer, would be that he had gone
against himself, and against his fellow-men, by outraging 
reason, the common attribute of the race.<p>

7. Far worse than that has the sinner done. He
has offended against his own reason, and thereby
against a higher Reason, substantially distinct from
his, standing to it in the relation of Archetype to
type, a Living Reason, <b>empsuchos logos</b> (cf. Ar., <i>Eth.</i>,
V., iv., 7), purely and supremely rational. The
Archetype is outraged by the violation of the type.
Moreover, as the two are substantially distinct, the
one being God, the other a faculty of man, there is
room for a command, for law. A man may transgress 
and sin, in more than the <i>philosophical</i> sense
of the word: he may be property a <i>law-breaker</i>, by
offending against this supreme Reason, higher and
other than his own.<p>

8. Here we must pause and meditate a parable.
-- There was a certain monastery where the monks
lived in continual violation of monastic observance.
Their Abbot was a holy man, a model of what a
monk ought to be.  But though perfectly cognisant
of the delinquencies of his community, he was content 
to display to his subjects the edifying example
of his own life, and to let it appear that he was aware
of their doings and pained at them.  He would croon
softly as he went about the house old Heli~'s words:
" Not so, my sons, not so: why do ye these kind of
things, very wicked things?" But the monks took
no notice of him. It happened in course of time
that the Abbot went away for about ten days. What
he did in that time, never transpired: though there
was some whisper of certain "spiritual exercises,"
which he was said to have been engaged in. Certain
it is, that he returned to his monastery, as he left
it, a monk devout and regular: the monk was the
same, but the Abbot was mightily altered. The
morning after his arrival, a Chapter was held; the
Abbot had the Rule read from cover to cover, and
announced his intention of enforcing the same.
And he was as good as his word. Transgressions
of course abounded: but the monks discovered
that to transgress was quite a different thing now
from what it had been. Seeing the law proclaimed,
and the Abbot in earnest to enforce it, they too
reformed themselves. The few who would not reform
had to leave. The subsequent holy lives of those
monks do not enter into this history.<p>

9. Now, we might fancy God our Lord like the
Abbot of that monastery in the early years of his
rule.  We might fancy the Supreme Reason, displeased 
indeed, as Reason must be, at the excesses
and follies of mankind, but not otherwise commanding 
men to avoid those evil courses.  Were
God to be thus quiescent, what we have called (n. 6)
<i>philosophical sin</i>, would indeed carry this additional
malice, beyond what was there set down, of being
an offence against God, but it would not be a
grievous offence: for it would not be a sin in the
proper sense of the term, not being a transgression
of the law of God, inasmuch as God, by the supposition, 
would have given no law. But the supposition
itself is absurd. God could not so withhold His
command. He is free indeed not to command, but
that only by not creating. If He wills to have
creatures, He must likewise will to bind them to
certain lines of action: which will to bind in God is
a law to the creature.<p>

10. This assertion, that <i>God cannot but will to bind
His creatures to certain lines of action</i>, must be proved,
though in the ascent we have to mount to high
regions, and breathe those subtle airs that are
wafted round the throne of the Eternal. As God
is the one source of all reality and of all power,
not only can there be no being which He has not
created and does rot still preserve, but no action
either can take place without His concurrence.  God
must go with His every creature in its every act:
otherwise, on the creature's part, nothing could be
done. Now, God cannot be indifferent what manner
of act He shall concur unto. A servant or a subject
may be indifferent what command he receives: he
may will simply to obey, -- to go here or there, as he
is bid, or to be left without orders where he is.
That is because he leaves the entire direction and
management of the household to his master. But
for God to be thus indifferent what action He should
lend His concurrence to, would be to forego all
design and purpose of His own as to the use and
destiny of the creatures which He has made and
continually preserves.  This God cannot do, for He
cannot act aimlessly. It would be renouncing the
direction of His own work, and making the creature
Ills superior.  God is incapable of such renunciation
and subservience.  He must, then, will the cooperation 
which He lends, and the concurrent action of
the creature, to take a certain course, regulated and
prescribed by Himself: which is our proposition,
that God cannot but will to bind His creatures
to certain lines of action.  If His free creatures
choose to stray from these lines, God indeed
still cooperates, and to His cooperation is to be
ascribed the <i>physical</i> goodness of the action, not its
<i>moral inordinateness and inopportuneness</i>. Still, as the
action is morally inordinate, God may be said to
cooperate, in a manner, where He would not:
whence we gather some conception of the enormity
of sin. (See c. vii., nn. 5, 6, pp. 130, 131.)<p>

11. The lines of action laid down and prescribed
by Godare not arbitrary and irrespective of the
subject of the command. They are determined in
each case by the nature of the subject.  The Author
of Nature is not apt to subvert that order which
proceeds from Himself. He bids every creature act
up to that nature wherein He has created it.  His
commands follow the line of natural exigency.
What this natural exigency amounts to in man in
regard to his human acts, we have already seen.
(c. vi., s. i., p. 109.)<p>

12. The difference between a necessary and a free
agent is, that the former is determined by its matter
to act in a certain way, and cannot act otherwise:
the latter may act in more ways than one. Still, as
we have seen, the nature even of a free agent is not
indifferent to all manner of action.  It requires,
though it does not constrain, the agent to act in
certain definite ways, the ways of moral goodness.
Acting otherwise, as he may do, the free agent gainsays 
his own nature, taken as a whole, a thing that
a necessary agent can nowise do.  God therefore
who, as we have shown, wills and commands all
creatures whatsoever to act on the lines of their
nature, has especial reason to give this command to
His rational creatures, with whom alone rests the
momentous freedom to disobey.<p>

13. We are now abreast of the question, of such
burning interest in these days, as to the connection
of Ethics with Theology, or of Morality with Religion.  
I will not enquire whether the dogmatic atheist is
logically consistent in maintaining any distinction
between right and wrong: happily, dogmatic atheists
do not abound. But there are many who hold that,
whether there bea God or no, the fact ought not to
be imported into Moral Science: that a Professor of
Ethics, as such, has no business with the name of
the Almighty on his lips, any more than a lecturer
on Chemistry or Fortification.  This statement
must be at once qualified by an important proviso.  
If we have any duties of worship and praise towards
our Maker: if there is such a virtue as religion, and
such a sin as blasphemy: surely a Professor of
Morals must point, that out.  He cannot in that case
suppress all reference to God, for the same reason
that he cannot help going into the duties of a man
to his wife, or of an individual to the State, if
marriage and civil government are natural institutions. 
If there is a God to be worshipped, any book
on Moral Science is incomplete without a chapter
on Religion.  But the question remains, whether
the name of God should enter into the other
chapters, and His being and authority into the very
foundations of the science. I do not mean the metaphysical 
foundations; for Metaphysics are like a
two-edged sword, that cleaves down to the very
marrow of things, and must therefore reveal and
discover God. But Morality, like Mathematics,
takes certain metaphysical foundations for granted,
without enquiring into them. On these foundations
we rear the walls, so to speak, of the science of
Ethics without reference to God, but we cannot put
the roof and crown upon the erection, unless we
speak of Him and of His law. Moral distinctions, as
we saw (c. vi., s. i. n. 7, p. 113), are antecedent to the
Divine command to observe them: and though they
rest ultimately on the Divine nature, that ultimate
ground belongs to Metaphysics, not to Ethics. Ethics
begin with human nature, pointing out that there
are certain human acts that do become a man, and
others that do not. (c. vi., s.i., p. 109.) To see this, it is
not necessary to look up above man. Thus we shall
prove lying, suicide, and murder to be wrong, and
good fellowship a duty, without needing to mention
the Divine Being, though by considering Him the
proof gains in cogency. Or rather, apart from God
we shall prove certain acts wrong, and other acts
obligatory as duties, <i>philosophically</i> speaking, with an
initial and fundamental wrongness and obligation.
In the present section we have proved once for all,
that what is wrong philosophically, or is philosophically 
a duty, is the same also theologically.  
Thus the initial and fundamental obligation is
transformed into an obligation formal and complete.
Therefore, hereafter we shall be content to have
established the philosophical obligation, knowing
that the theological side is invariably conjoined
therewith.  As St. Thomas says (1a 2ae, q. 71,
art. 6, ad 5) -- "By theologians sin is considered
principally as it is an offence against God: but by
the moral philosopher, inasmuch as it is contrary to
reason." But what is contrary to reason offends
God, and is forbidden by Divine law, and thus
becomes a sin. No God, no sin. Away from God,
there is <i>indecency</i> and <i>impropriety</i>, <i>unreasonableness</i>,
<i>abomination</i>, and <i>brutality</i>, all this in view of outraged
humanity: there is likewise crime against the State:
but the formal element of sin is wanting. With sin,
of course, disappears also the punishment of sin as
such. Thus to leave God wholly out of Ethics and
Natural Law, is to rob moral evil of half its terrors,
and of that very half which is more easily "understanded 
of the people." A consideration for schoolmanagers.<p>
