<h1>Appendix.</h1>

OF the precepts of Natural Law, some are more
simple and of wider extension; others are derivative,
complex, and extend to fewer cases. It is a question
of more and less, and no hard and fast line of
demarcation can be drawn between them.  The
former however are called <i>primary</i>, the latter
<i>secondary</i> precepts. Again, the nature of man is
the same in all men and at all periods of history
for its essential elements, but admits of wide 
accidental variation and declension for the worse.
Thirdly, it is clear that Natural Law is a law good
and suitable for human nature to observe. Starting
from these three axioms, we apply the reasoning of
St. Thomas, 1a 2ae, q. 96, art. 2, not to human law
alone, of which he is speaking, but to sundry
secondary precepts of Natural Law. These are his
words:<p>

"A law is laid down as a rule or measure of
human acts. Now a measure ought to be 
homogeneous with the thing measured. Hence laws
also must be imposed upon men according to their
condition. As Isidore says: 'A law ought to be
possible both according to nature and according to
the custom of the country.' Now the power or
faculty of action proceeds from interior habit or
disposition. The same thing is not possible to him
who has no habit of virtue, that is possible to a
virtuous man; as the same thing is not possible to
a boy and to a grown man, and therefore the same
rule is not laid down for children as for adults.
Many things are allowed to children, that in adults
are visited with legal punishment or with blame,
and in like manner many things must be allowed
to men not perfect in virtue, which would be
intolerable in virtuous men."<p>

This reasoning leads us up to a conclusion,
which St. Thomas states thus (1a 2ae, q. 94. art. 5):
"A conceivable way in which the Natural Law
might be changed is the way of subtraction, that
something should cease to be of the Natural Law
that was of it before. Understanding change in this
sense, the Natural Law is absolutely immutable in
its first principles; but as to secondary precepts,
which are certain detailed conclusions closely 
related to the first principles, the Natural Law is not
so changed as that its dictate is not right in most
cases steadily to abide by; it may however be
changed in some particular case, and in rare
instances, through some special causes impeding
the observance of these secondary precepts."
The reason for this conclusion, more pregnant,
it may be, than St. Thomas himself discerned, is
given briefly as follows (2a 2ae, q. 57, art. 2, ad 1)
"Human nature is changeable; and therefore
what is natural to man may sometimes fail to hold
good."<p>

The precepts of Natural Law that fail to be
applicable when human nature sinks below par,
are only secondary precepts, and few even of them.  
Christianity brings human nature up to par, and
<i>fulfils</i> the Natural Law (St.  Matt. v. 17), enjoining
the observance of it in its integrity. This is the
meaning of St. John Chrysostom's saying: "Of
old not such an ample measure of virtue was 
proposed to us; . . . but since the coming of Christ
the way has been made much narrower." (<i>De Virginitate</i>, 
c. 44: <i>cf</i>. his 17th Homily on St. Matt. v. 37;
indeed the doctrine is familiar in his pages.)
