<h1>Preface (1905)</h1>

For fifteen years this Manual has enjoyed all the popularity that its 
author could desire. With that popularity the author is the last person 
to wish to interfere. Therefore, not to throw previous copies out of 
use, this edition makes no alteration either in the pagination of the 
text already printed. At the same time the author might well be argued 
to have lapsed into strange supineness and indifference to moral 
science, if in fifteen years he had learnt nothing new, and found 
nothing in his work which he wished to improve. Whoever will be at the 
expense of purchasing my <i>Political and Moral Essays</i> (Benziger, 
1902, 6s.) will find in the first essay on the <i>Origin and Extent of 
Civil Authority</i> an advantageous substitute for the chapter on the 
State in this work. The essay is a dissertation written for the degree 
of B.Sc. in the University of Oxford; and represents, I hope, tolerably 
well the best contemporary teaching on the subject.<p>

If the present work had to be rewritten, I should make a triple 
division of Moral Philosophy, into Ethics, Deontology (the science of 
<b>to deon</b>, i.e., of what <i>ought</i> to be done), and Natural Law. For 
if "the principal business of Ethics is to determine what moral 
obligation is" (p. 2), then the classical work on the subject, the 
<i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> of Aristotle, is as the play of Hamlet with 
the character of Hamlet left out: for in that work there is no analysis 
of moral obligation, no attempt to "fix the comprehension of the idea I 
<i>ought</i>" (ib.). The system there exposed is a system of 
Eudaemonism, not of Deontology. It is not a treatise on Duty, but on 
Happiness: it tells us what happiness, or rational well-being, is, and 
what conduct is conducive to rational well-being. It may be found 
convenient to follow Aristotle, and avow that the business of Ethics is 
not Duty, not Obligation, not Law, not Sanction, but Happiness. That 
fiery little word <i>ought</i> to do this, and avoid that, <i>if</i> he 
means to be a happy man: cf. p. 115. Any man who declares that he does 
not care about ethical or rational happiness, stands to Ethics as that 
man stands to Music who "hath no ear for concord of sweet sounds." <p>

All that Ethics or Music can do for such a Philistine is to "send him 
away to another city, pouring ointment on his head, and crowning him 
with wool," as Plato would dismiss the tragedian (<i>Republic</i> III. 
398). The author of the <i>Magna Moralia</i> well says (I. i. 13): "No 
science or faculty ever argues the goodness of the end which it 
proposes to itself: it belongs to some other faculty to consider that. 
Neither the physician says that health is a good thing, nor the builder 
that a house is a good thing: but the one announces that he produces 
health and how he produces it, and the builder in like manner a house." 
The professor of Ethics indeed, from the very nature of his subject 
matter, says in pointing out happiness that it is the rational 
sovereign good of man; but to any one unmoved by that demonstration 
Ethics can have no more to say. Ethics will not threaten, nor talk of 
duty, law, or punishment.<p>

Ethics, thus strictly considered on an Aristotelian basis, are 
antecedent to Natural Theology. They belong rather to Natural 
Anthropology: they are a study of human nature. But as human nature 
points to God, so Ethics are not wholly irrespective of God, 
considering Him as the object of human happiness and worship, -- the 
Supreme Being without whom all the aspirations of humanity are at fault 
(pp. 13-26, 191-197).  Ethics do not refer to the commandments of God, 
for this simple reason, that they have nothing to say to commandments, 
or laws, or obligation, or authority. They are simply a system of moral 
hygiene, which a man may adopt or not: only, like any other physician, 
the professor of Ethics utters a friendly warning that misery must 
ensue upon the neglect of what makes for health.<p>

Deontology, not Ethics, expounds and vindicates the idea, <i>I 
ought</i>. It is the science of Duty, It carries the mild suasions of 
Ethics into laws, and out of moral prudence it creates conscience. And 
whereas Ethics do not deal with sin, except under the aspect of what is 
called "philosophical sin" (p. 119, ^6), Deontology defines sin in its 
proper theological sense, as "an offence against God, or any thought, 
word, or deed against the law of God." Deontology therefore presupposes 
and is consequent upon Natural Theology. At the same time, while Ethics 
indicate a valuable proof of the existence of God as the requisite 
Object of Happiness, Deontology affords a proof of Him as the requisite 
Law-giver. Without God, man's rational desire is frustrate, and man's 
conscience a misrepresentation of fact.[1]<p>

In this volume, pp. 1-108 make up the treatise on Ethics: pp. 109-176 
that on Deontology.<p>

Aristotle writes: "He that acts by intelligence and cultivates 
understanding, is likely to be best disposed and dearest to God. For 
if, as is thought, there is any care of human things on the part of 
them to delight in that which is best and most akin to themselves, that 
is, in intelligence, and to make a return of good to such as supremely 
love and honour intelligence, as cultivating the thing dearest to 
Heaven, and so behaving rightly and well. Such, plainly, is the 
behaviour of the wise. The wise man therefore is the dearest to God" 
(Nic. Eth. X. ix. 13). But Aristotle does not work out the connexion 
between God and His law on the one hand and human conscience and duty 
on the other. In that direction the Stoics, and after them the Roman 
Jurists, went further than Aristotle. By reason of this deficiency, 
Aristotle, peerless as he is in Ethics, remains an imperfect Moral 
Philosopher.<p>


<h2>Preface to the Fourth Edition (1918)</h2>

1.  I have altered the opening pages in accordance with the Preface to 
the edition of 1905.<p>

2.  I have added a paragraph on Syndicalism (pp. 291-2).<p>

3.  Also a new Table of Addenda et Corrigenda, and a new Index.<p>

The quotations from St. Thomas may be read in English, nearly all of 
them, in the Author's <i>Aquinas Ethicus</i>, 2 vols.; 12s. (Burns and 
Oates.)
