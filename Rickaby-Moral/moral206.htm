<h1>Chapter VI.  Of Marriage.</h1>

<hr><p><h2>Section. I -- <i>Of the Institution of Marriage</i>.</h2>

1. MARRIAGE, is defined by the Canonists: <i>the union
of male and female, involving their living together in
undivided intercourse</i>. In the present order of 
Providence, the marriage contract between baptized
persons is a sacrament, under the superintendence
of the Church, the fertile theme of canonists and
theologians. As philosophers, we deal with marriage
as it would be, were there no sacraments, no Church,
and no Incarnation, present or to come. This is
marriage in the order of pure nature.<p>

2. It is natural to all animals to propagate their
kind, natural therefore also to man; and being
natural, it is so far forth also a good thing, unless
we are to say with the Manicheans, that the whole
of corporeal nature is an evil creation.  Nay, so
urgent is the natural appetite here, that we must
argue the existence, not of a mere permission, but of
an exigency of nature, and consequent command of
God (<i>Ethics</i>, c. vi., s. ii., nn. ii, 12, p. 122), for the 
propagation of the human species. Besides, there is in
the individual the duty of self-preservation, therefore
likewise in the race.  Again, the old cannot subsist
at all without the support of the young, nor lead a
cheerful existence without their company. Imagine
a world with no youth in it, a winter without a
spring!<p>

3. There is this difference between self-preservation 
and the preservation of the race, that if a man
will not eat, none can eat for him; but if one man
omit the propagation of his kind, another can take
it up. There are many things necessary for the
good of mankind, which are not to be done by every
individual. Not all are to be soldiers, nor all builders,
though houses are needful, and sometimes war.  Nor
is it desirable that the human race should be multiplied 
to its utmost capacity. It is enough here to
mention without discussing the teaching of Malthus,
how population presses on the means of subsistence,
the latter increasing in an arithmetical, the former
in a geometrical ratio. Without going the whole
way with Malthus, modern economical writers are
commonly a little Malthusian, and shrink from giving
to all and each of their species the word to "increase
and multiply."<p>

4. But, it will be said, sickly and consumptive
subjects, and still more those who have any tendency
to madness, may well be excused from having
children; so too may they be excused whose poverty
cannot keep a family; excused too is the inveterate
drunkard, and all habitual criminals, by the principle
of heredity, lest they transmit to posterity an evil
bodily predisposition; but the healthy and the
virtuous, men sound of mind and limb, of life 
unspotted, and in circumstances easy, the flower of
the race, -- none of these surely should omit to raise
up others to wear his lineaments: we want such
men multiplied. I answer, on natural grounds
alone: You may counsel, but you cannot compel,
either by positive law or ethical precept, any man
or woman to seek to have children.  You surely will
not breed men by selection, like cattle, as Plato
proposed. The union of the sexes, especially the
married union, is an act to be of all others the most
entirely free, spontaneous, uncommanded, and 
unconstrained. It should be a union of intense mutual
love. But a man may not meet with any woman
that he can love with passion; or, meeting such, he
may not be able to win her. Nor, considering the
indeterminateness of points of health, capacity, and
character, could any certain list be drawn up of
persons bound to have issue.  Thus the utmost that
can be argued is a counsel in this direction, a counsel
that mankind ordinarily are ready enough to comply
with. But if any one of seeming aptitude excuses
himself on the score of finding no partner to his
liking, or of a desire to travel, or of study, or still
more, of devotion -- and why should not a man, even
of natural piety, go out into solitude, like St. Antony,
to hold communion with his Maker? -- all these
excuses must be taken. It is lawful then in the
state of mere nature, upon any one of many sufficient
grounds, to stand aside and relinquish to your neighbour 
the privilege and responsibility of giving increase 
to the human family.<p>

5. But if it is no one individual's duty to propagate 
his kind, how is it that we have laid down that
there is such a duty? For the duty is incumbent
upon them that alone can do it, and it can only be
done by individuals. The answer rests on a 
distinction between <i>proximate</i> and <i>remote</i> duty. The
propagation of the race is the remote duty of every
individual, but at present the proximate duty of
none. A <i>remote</i> duty is a duty not now pressing
but which would have to be performed in a certain
contingency, which contingency happening, the duty
becomes <i>proximate</i>. If there appeared a danger of
our race dying out, the survivors would be beholden,
especially those in power, to take steps for its 
continuance. Rewards might then be held out, like the
<i>jus trium liberorum</i> instituted at Rome by Augustus;
and if necessary, penalties inflicted on celibacy. In
this one extreme case the matrimonial union might
be made matter of legal constraint. But when will
such constraint become necessary?<p>

6. The continuance of the human race must be
wrought out by man and woman standing in that
abiding and exclusive relation to one another, which,
constitutes the state of marriage. Nature abhors
promiscuity, or free love. It is the delight of writers
who use, perhaps abuse, Darwin's name, to picture
primitive mankind as all living in this infrabestial
state. But "the state supposed is suicidal, and
instead of allowing the expansion of the human race,
would have produced infertility, and probably 
disease, and at best only allowed the existing numbers
to maintain, under the most favourable circumstances, 
a precarious existence.  To suppose, therefore, 
that the whole human race for any considerable
time were without regular marriage, is physiologically
impossible. They could never have survived it."
(Devas, <i>Studies of Family Life</i>, # 101.)<p>

7. Even if the alleged promiscuity ever did
prevail -- and it may have obtained to some extent
in certain degraded portions of humanity -- its prevalence 
was not its justification.  The practice cannot
have been befitting in any stage of the evolution of
human society. As in all things we suppose our
readers to have understanding, we leave it to them
to think out this matter for themselves. Suffice it
here to put forward two grand advantages gained
and ends achieved, which are called by theologians
"the goods of marriage."<p>

8. The first good of marriage is the offspring that
is born of it. Nature wills, not only the being, but
the well-being of this offspring, and that both in the
physical and in the moral order. Very important
for the physical health of the child it is, that it be
born of parents whose animal propensities are under
some restraint; such restraint the bond of marriage
implies. Then, in the moral order, the child requires
to be educated with love, a love that shall be guided
by wisdom, and supported by firmness. Love,
wisdom, and firmness, they are the attributes of
both parents; but love is especially looked for from
the mother, wisdom and firmness from the father.  
And, what is important, both have an <i>interest</i> in the
child such as no other human being can take. We
are speaking of the normal father or mother, not of
many worthless parents that actually are; for, as
Aristotle often lays it down, we must not judge of a
thing from its bad specimens. No doubt, the State
could establish public nurseries and infant schools,
and provide a staff of nurses and governesses, more
scientific educators than even the normal parent;
but who, that has not been most unhappy in his
origin, would wish his own infancy to have been
reared in such a place? What certificated stranger
can supply for a mother's love?<p>

9. The second good of marriage is the mutual
<i>faith</i> of the partners. Plato never made a greater
mistake than when he wrote that "the female sex
differs from the male in mankind only in this, that
the one bears children, while the other begets them;"
and consequently that "no occupation of social life
belongs to a woman because she is a woman, or to
a man because he is a man, but capacities are equally
distributed in both sexes, and woman naturally bears
her share in all occupations, and man his share, only
that in all woman is weaker than man." (<i>Republic</i>,
454 D; 455 D.) Over against this we must set
Aristotle's correction: "Cohabitation among human
kind is not for the mere raising of children, but also
for the purposes of a partnership in life: for from the
first the offices of man and woman are distinct and
different: thus they mutually supply for one another,
putting their several advantages into the common
stock." (Ar., <i>Eth</i>., VIII., xii. 7.) Elsewhere he sets
forth these several offices in detail: "The nature
of both partners, man and woman, has been pre-arranged 
by a divine dispensation in view of their
partnership: for they differ by not having their 
faculties available all to the same effect, but some even to
opposite effects, though combining to a common end:
for God made the one sex stronger and the other
weaker, that the one for fear may be the more careful,
and the other for courage the more capable of self-defence; 
and that the one may forage abroad, while
the other keeps house: and for work the one is made
competent for sedentary employments, but too
delicate for an out-door life, while the other makes
a poor figure at keeping still, but is vigorous and
robust in movement; and touching children, the
generation is special, but the improvement of the
children is the joint labour of both parents, for
it belongs to the one to nurture, to the other to
chastise." (Ar., <i>Econ</i>., i. 3.)<p>

These passages are enough to suggest more than
they actually contain, of two orders of qualities
arranged antithetically one over against another in
man and woman, so that the one existence becomes
complementary to the other, and the two conjoined
form one perfect human life. This life-communion,
called by divines <i>fides</i>, or mutual faith, is then the
second good fruit of marriage.  Indeed it is the more:
characteristically human good, <i>offspring</i> being rather,
related to the animal side of our nature. But as
animal and rational elements make one human
being, so do <i>offspring</i> and <i>mutual faith</i> constitute the
adequate good of that human union of the sexes,
which we call marriage.<p>

10. Whatever good there is in marriage, connections 
formed by either party beyond the marriage-bed, 
are agents of confusion to the undoing of all
that good and the practical dissolution of the
marriage.<p>

<i>Readings</i>. -- Contra Gentes, iii., 122; <i>ib.</i>, iii., 126;
<i>ib.</i>, iii., 136; Devas, <i>Studies of Family Life</i>, ## 90-101,
where he disposes of the proof of primitive promiscuity, 
drawn from the fact that in early societies
kinship is traced and property claimed only through
the mother.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- <i>Of the Unity of Marriage</i>.</h2>

1. <i>Both man and woman are by nature incapable of a
second marriage, while their former marriage endures</i>.
No woman can have two husbands at the same time,
which is <i>polyandry</i>; and no man can have two wives
at the same time, which is <i>polygamy</i>. The second
marriage attempted is not only illicit, but invalid:
it is no contract, no marriage at all, and all cohabitation 
with the second partner is sheer adultery. This
is a great deal more than saying that polyandry and
polygamy are unlawful.<p>

2. That is by nature no marriage, which is Inconsistent 
with the natural ends of marriage, offspring
and mutual faith. But polyandry is thus inconsistent
with the good of offspring, and polygamy with mutual
faith. It is not meant that polyandry makes the
birth of children impossible. But nature is solicitous,
not for the mere birth, but for the rearing and good
estate of the child born. Now a child born fatherless 
is in an ill plight for its future education.
Posthumous children in lawful wedlock are born
fatherless: that is a calamity: but what shall we
think of an institution which makes that calamity to
the child sure always to occur? Such an institution
is polyandry.  For in it no man can ever know his
own child, except by likeness, and likeness in a baby
face is largely as you choose to fancy it. Again, is
the polyandrous wife to be, or not to be, the head of
the family ? If not, the family -- for it ought to be
one family, where there is one mother -- will have as
many heads as she has husbands, a pretty specimen
of a house divided against itself. If she is to be
the head, that is a perversion of the natural order
of predominance between the sexes. In any case,
polyandry is little better than promiscuity: it is fatal
to the family and fatal to the race; and children
born of it are born out of marriage.<p>

3. Against polygamy the case in natural law is
not quite so strong as against polyandry. Still it is
a strong case enough in the interest of the wife. The
words spoken by the bride to the bridegroom in the
marriage rite of ancient Rome, <i>Ubi tu Caius, ego
Caia</i>, "Where you are master, I am mistress,"
declare the relation of mutual faith as it should be,
namely, a relation of equality, with some advantage,
preference, and pre-eminence allowed to the husband, 
yet not so great advantage as to leave him
free where she is straitly bound, and reduce her to
the servile level of one in a row of minions to
his passion and sharers of his divided affections.
Polygamy in all ages has meant the lowering of
womankind:<p>

<blockquote>
 He will hold thee
 Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.
</blockquote><p>

At its strongest, the love of man for woman,
where polygamy obtains, is a flame of passion, that
quickly spends itself on one object, and then passes
to another; not a rational, enduring, human affection.
It is also a fact, that the increase of the race is not
greater in polygamy than in monogamy. Thus, as
a practice that runs strongly counter to one of the
great purposes of marriage, and is, to say the least,
no help to the other, and carries with it the
humiliation of the female sex, polygamy is justly
argued to be abhorrent to nature.<p>

4. It is beside the purpose of this work to enter,
into the questions of morality that arise out of Holy
Scripture, considered as an inspired record of the
actions of the Saints. But the polygamy of the
patriarchs of old so readily occurs to mind, that it
is worth while to mention four conceivable explanations, 
if only to indicate which is and which is not
reconcilable with our philosophy. The first explanation 
would be, that polygamy is not against the
natural law, but only against the positive divine law,
which was derogated from in this instance. We
have made it out to be against the natural law. The
second explanation would be that God gave the
patriarchs a dispensation, strictly so called, from
this point of the natural law. We have maintained
that God cannot, strictly speaking, dispense from
one jot or tittle of natural law. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. viii., s. iii.,
nn. 1-3, p. 147.) A third explanation would be
founded on the words of St. Paul to the Athenians
(Acts xvii. 30), about "God overlooking the times of
this ignorance." This would suppose that mankind,
beginning in monogamy, from passion and ignorance
lapsed quickly into polygamy: that the patriarchs
in good faith conformed to the practice of their time;
and that God, in their case as with the rest of mankind, 
awaited His own destined hour for the light of
better knowledge to break upon the earth. A fourth
explanation would be this. God by His supreme
dominion can dissolve any marriage, By the same
dominative power He can infringe and partially
make void any marriage contract without entirely
undoing it. The marriage contract, existing in its
fulness and integrity, is a bar to any second similar
contract, as we have proved. But what, on this
theory, the Lord God did with the marriages of the
patriarchs was this: He partially unravelled and
undid the contract, so as to leave room for a
second contract, and a third, each having the bare
essentials of a marriage, but none of them the full
integrity.<p>

The explanation however most in accordance
with our views (see Appendix) would be, that the
prohibition of polygamy, being a secondary precept
of the natural law, failed in its application in that
age of lapsed humanity, when a woman was better
one of many wives, all protected by one husband,
than exposed to promiscuous violence and lust.
(Cf. Genesis xx.; Isaias iv. 1.) <p>

Suarez, <i>De Legibus</i>, II., xv., 28.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section III. -- <i>Of the Indissolubility of Marriage.</i></h2>

1. This section is pointed not so much against a
separation -- which may take place by mutual consent,
or without that, by grievous infidelity or cruelty of
one party -- as against a divorce <i>a vinculo</i>, which is
a dissolution of a marriage in the lifetime of the 
parties, enabling each of them validly and lawfully
to contract with some other. The unity of marriage
is more essential than its indissolubility. Nature is
more against polygamy than against divorce. Even
Henry VIII. stuck at polygamy.  In the present
arrangement, a divorce <i>a vinculo</i> is obtainable in
three cases.  First, when of two unbaptized persons,
man and wife, the one is converted, and the unconverted 
party refuses to live peaceably in wedlock, the
convert may marry again, and thereupon also the
other party. So the Church understands St. Paul,
1 Cor. vii. 13, 15.  Again, the Pope can grant a
divorce <i>a vinculo</i> in the marriage of baptized persons
before cohabitation.  Such a marriage in that stage
is also dissolved by the profession of one of the
parties in a religious order. Beyond these three
cases, the Catholic Church allows neither the lawfulness 
nor the validity of any divorce <i>a vinculo</i> by
whomsoever given to whatsoever parties.<p>

2. It is ours to investigate the lie of the law of
nature, having due regard to the points marked,
antecedently to our search, by the definition of 
infallible authority. Nothing can be done in the
Church against the law of nature: since therefore
divorce <i>a vinculo</i> is sometimes recognized in the
Church, it may be contended that marriage is not
by nature absolutely indissoluble. On the other
hand, it is a proposition censured by Pius IX. in the
Syllabus, n. 67: "By the law of nature the bond of
marriage is not indissoluble." Thus it appears we
must teach that marriage is naturally indissoluble,
still not absolutely so, just as a safe is justly 
advertised as fire-proof, when it will resist any 
conflagration that is likely to occur, though it would be
consumed in a blast-furnace or in a volcano. So
marriage is indissoluble, if it holds good for all
ordinary contingencies, for all difficulties that may
be fairly reckoned with and regarded as not quite
improbable, for every posture of affairs that the 
contracting parties before their union need at all consider.
Or, if the three cases of divorce actually allowed are
to be traced to the dominative power of God (<i>Ethics</i>,
c. vii., n. 2, p. 129), We may teach that marriage is
by nature absolutely indissoluble, and that divorce
is as much against the law of nature as the killing of
an innocent man, excepting in the case of God's
dominion being employed to quash the contract or
the right to life. But against this latter view is to
be set the consideration, that God is manifestly
averse to using His dominative power to overturn
natural ordinances. He does not hand the innocent
over to death except in the due course of physical
nature: why then should He ever put forth His
power against the marriage-tie, unless it be that
nature herself in certain cases postulates its severance? 
But if such is ever nature's petition, the
universal and unconditional permanence of the
marriage-tie cannot be a requisition of nature, nor
is divorce absolutely excluded by natural law.<p>

3. Thomas Sanchez, than whom there is no
greater authority on this subject, records his opinion
that "a certain inseparability is of the nature of
marriage," but that "absolute indissolubility does
not attach to marriage by the law of nature." He
adds: "if we consider marriage as it is an office of
nature for the propagation of the race, it is hard to
render a reason why for the wife's barrenness the
husband should not be allowed to put her away, or
marry another." (<i>De Matrimonio</i>, 1. ii., d. 13, n. 7.)
We proceed to prove that "a certain inseparability
is of the nature of marriage," so that marriage may
truly be said to be indissoluble by the law of nature.
Whether this natural indissolubility is absolute, and
holds for every conceivable contingency, the student
must judge by the proofs.<p>

4. If a divorce <i>a vinculo</i> were a visible object
on the matrimonial horizon, the parties would be
strongly encouraged thereby to form illicit connections, 
in the expectation of shortly having any
one of them they chose ratified and sanctified by
marriage. Marriage would be entered upon lightly,
as a thing easily done and readily undone, a state
of things not very far in advance of promiscuity.
Between married persons little wounds would fester,
trifling sores would be angered into ulcers: any
petty strife might lead to a fresh contract, made in
haste and repented of with speed: then fond, vain
regrets for the former partnership.  Affinity would
be a loose bond of friendship between families; and
after divorce it would turn to enmity. The fair but
weaker sex would suffer the more by this as by all
other matrimonial perversions: for the man has not
so much difficulty in lighting upon another love, but
the woman -- she illustrates the Greek proverb of
a fallen estate:

<blockquote>
Mighty was Miletus in the bygone days of yore
</blockquote><p>

The divorced wife offers fewer attractions than the
widow.<p>

5. It is well to bear in mind that, at least by
the positive ordinance of God in the present order
of His Providence, the marriage of baptized persons,
after cohabitation, is absolutely indissoluble; and
no marriage can be dissolved except in the three
cases specified. (n. i.)<p>
