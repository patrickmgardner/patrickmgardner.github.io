<h1>Chapter VIII. Of the State.</h1>

<hr><p><h2>Section VI. -- <i>Of the Elementary and Original Polity</i>.</h2>

1. "All things are double, one against another."
(Ecclus. xlii. 25.) The son of Sirach may have had
in view the human body as divisible by a vertical
median line into two symmetrical halves.  But in
each of the halves thus made, the same organ or
limb is never repeated twice in exact likeness, nor
do any two parts render exactly the same service.
This variety of organs in the bodies of the higher
animals is called <i>differentiation</i>. As we descend in
the animal series we find less and less of differentiation, 
till we reach the lowest types, which are little
more than a mere bag, whence their name of
Ascidians. In that State which has London for
its capital city, we behold one of the highest types
of political existence. Sovereignty is there divided
as usual in modern States, into three branches,
Legislative, Judicial, and Executive. Each of these
branches is shared among many persons in various
modes and degrees, so that in practice it is not easy
to enumerate and specify the holders of sovereignty,
nor to characterize so complex a polity. At the other
end of the scale we may represent to ourselves 250
"squatters" forming an independent State in the
far West of America. They are a pure democracy,
and the sovereignty belongs to them all jointly.  Is
a man to be tried for his life ? The remaining
249 are his judges. Is a tax to be levied on ardent
spirits? The 250 vote it. Is there a call to arms?
The 250 marshal themselves to war.  That clearly
is the condition of minimum differentiation, where
one citizen is in all political points the exact counter-
part of all the rest. Of all polities it is the most
<i>simple and elementary</i> possible.  And so far forth as the
natural order of evolution in polities, as in all other
things, is from simple to compound, this is also the
<i>original</i> polity. It is also the <i>residuary</i> polity, that,
namely, which comes to be, when all other government 
in the State vanishes. Thus, if the Powder
Plot had succeeded, and King James I., with the
royal family, Lords and Commons, with the judge
and chief officers of the Executive, had all perished
together, the sovereign authority in England would
have devolved upon the nation as a whole.<p>

2. Certain monarchical writers shrink from the
recognition of pure democracy as either the first or
the last term of the series of polities.  They do not
recognize it as a polity at all.  When there is no
governing body distinct from the mass of people at
large, a government must be formed, they say, by
popular suffrage. Meanwhile, according to them,
the sovereign power rests not with the body of
electors: either it is not yet created, or it has
lapsed: but as soon as the election is made, they
see sovereignty breaking forth like the sun rising, in
the person, single or composite, who is the object of
the people's choice. This would be the correct view
of the matter, if no choice were left to the electors,
but they were obliged to acquiesce in some prearranged 
polity, as a Monarchy, or a Council of
Ten, and could do nothing more than designate the
Monarch or the Council. Under such a restriction
the Cardinals elect the Pope. But our electors can
institute any polity they see fit. They are a 
Constituent Assembly. They may fix upon a monarchy
or a republic, two or one legislative chambers, a,
wide or a narrow franchise, home rule or centralization: 
or they may erect a Provisional Government
for five years with another appeal to the people at
the end of that term. More than that. They could
impose a protective duty upon corn, or endow the
Roman Catholic religion, making such protection or
endowment a fundamental law (s. iv., n. 8, p. 323), and
withholding from the government, which they proceed 
to set up, the power of meddling with that
law. They are then not only a Constituent but
likewise a Legislative Assembly.  But this power of
making laws and moulding the future constitution 
of the State, what else is it but sovereign
power, and indeed the very highest manifestation
of sovereignty?<p>

3. SO far we follow Suarez in his controversy
with James I. The <i>natural</i> order of evolution 
certainly is, that the State should be conceived in pure
democracy, and thence develop into other politics.
But in speaking as though the natural order had
always been the actual order, Suarez seems to have
been betrayed by the ardour of controversy into the
use of incorrect expressions. It is true in the
abstract, as he says, that "no natural reason can be
alleged why sovereignty should be fixed upon one
person, or one set of persons, rather than upon
another, short of the whole community." This
is true, inasmuch as in the abstract we view men as
men, in which specific character they are all equal.
But in the concrete and real life, the primeval
citizens who start a commonwealth are rarely alike
and equal, as the founders of the American Republic
at the separation from Great Britain pretty well
were, but some men, or some order of men, will so
much excel the rest in ability, position, or possessions, 
that the rest have really no choice but
to acquiesce in those gifted hands holding the
sovereignty.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section VII. -- <i>Of Resistance to Civil Power</i>.</h2>

"When they say the King owes his crown to the
choice of his people, they tell us that they mean to
say no more than that some of the King's predecessors 
have been called to the throne by some
sort of choice. Thus they hope to render their
proposition safe by rendering it nugatory." (Burke,
<i>Reflections on French Revolution</i>.)<p>

1. The great question about civil power is, not
whence it first came in remote antiquity, but whence
it is now derived and flows continually as from its
source, whether from the free consent of subjects so
long as that lasts, or whether it obtains independently 
of their consent. Can subjects overthrow
the ruler, or alter the polity itself, as often as they
have a mind so to do? or has the ruler a right to
his position even against the will of his people? A
parallel question is, can a province annexed to an
empire secede when it chooses, as South Carolina
and other Confederates once attempted secession
from the American Union?<p>

2. These questions raise two totally different
issues, which must be first carefully distinguished
and then severally answered. The first point at
issue is whether subjects may dethrone their ruler,
a people alter their polity, or a province secede
from an empire, <i>at discretion</i>. The second point is,
whether the same may be done <i>under pressure of dire
injustice</i>. One little matter of phraseology must be
rectified before an answer is returned to this first
point.  The question whether <i>subjects</i> may dethrone
their <i>ruler</i> at discretion, from the terms in which it
is drawn, can lead to none but a negative answer.  
From the fact that they are subjects, and this man,
or this body of men, their ruler, their allegiance
cannot be wholly discretionary. That sovereign is
a mere man of straw, there is no soul and substance
of sovereign power in him, who may be knocked down
and carted away for rubbish, any moment his so-called 
subjects please. Rousseau is quite clear on this
point.  The true debateable form of the question is,
whether the people, being themselves sovereign, can
remove at will the official persons who actually 
administer the State; whether they can change the polity,
and whether the inhabitants of a province can secede.
The answer now is simple: all depends upon the
polity of the particular country where the case comes
for discussion. And if so it be that the constitution
makes no provision one way or another, any dispute
that may occur must be settled by amicable arrangement 
among the parties concerned: if they cannot
amicably agree, they must fight. To save this last
eventuality, it were well that any claim which the
people in any country may have to remove princes
and statesmen from office, to alter the polity, or to
divide the empire, should be made matter of the
clearest understanding and most express and 
unambiguous stipulation. Even so, such a provision
must be generally viewed with disfavour by the
political philosopher, seeing how it tends to the
weakening and undermining of government; whereas
the same considerations that make out government
to be at all a boon and a necessity to human nature
argue incapacity and instability in the governing
power to be a deplorable evil. We must add, that
where the people keep in their hands any power to
alter the polity, or transfer the administration to
other hands, there they bold part at least of the
sovereignty; and the alteration or transference is
effected by them, not as subjects, but as partial ruler.<p>

3. The second point we raised was, whether a
dethronement, or an alteration of polity, or a secession, 
may be brought about, not indeed at discretion
for any cause, but under pressure of dire injustice.
it comes to this: May the civil power be resisted
when it does grievous wrong? Let us begin our
reply with another question: May children strike
their parents? No. Not even in self-defence? when
the parent is going about to do the child some
grievous bodily hurt? That is an unpleasant question, 
but the answer is plain. We can make no
exceptions to the rule of self-defence. Self-defence
in extreme cases may raise the arm of a child
against its parent: in a similar extremity it may set
a people in conflict with their civil ruler. Still we
regard with horror the idea of striking a parent,
and speak of it generally as a thing never to be
done: so should we regard and speak of rebellion.
We should not parade it before men's eyes as a
deed to be contemplated, admired, and readily put
in execution. "I confess to you, Sir," writes Burke,
I never liked this continual talk of resistance and
revolution, or the practice of making the extreme
medicine of the constitution its daily bread."<p>

4. The conditions under which the civil authority
may be withstood in self-defence, are fairly stated in
the <i>Dublin Review</i> for April, 1865, p. 292.  We must
premise, that such a course of self-defence once
publicly entered upon is like a rock rolled over the
brow of a steep mountain: down it rolls and rebounds 
from point to point, gathering momentum in
the descent, till in the end the ruler, once defied, has
to be dethroned, the polity subverted, the empire
rent, or they who made the resistance must perish.<p>

"Resistance is lawful: -- (1) When a government
has become substantially and habitually tyrannical,
and that is when it has lost sight of the common
good, and pursues its own selfish objects to the
manifest detriment of its subjects, especially where
their religious interests are concerned. (2) When
all legal and pacific means have been tried in vain
to recall the ruler to a sense of his duty. (3) When
there is a reasonable probability that resistance
will be successful, and not entail greater evils than
it seeks to remove. (4) When the judgment formed
as to the badness of the government, and the
prudence of resistance thereto, is not the opinion
only of private persons or of a mere party: but is
that of the larger and better portion of the people, so
that it may morally be considered as the judgment
of the community as a whole."<p>

5. Side by side with this we will set the teaching
of Leo XIII., Encyclical, <i>Quod Apostolici</i>.
"If ever it happens that civil power is wielded
by rulers recklessly and beyond all bounds, the
doctrine of the Catholic Church does not allow of
insurgents rising up against them <i>by independent
action (proprio marte)</i>, lest the tranquillity of order
be more and more disturbed, or society receive
greater injury thereby: and when things are come
to such a pass that <i>there appears no other ray or hope
of preservation</i>, the same authority teaches that a
remedy must be sought in the merits of Christian
patience and in earnest prayers to God."<p>

The words we have italicized seem to point to,
conditions (4) and (3) respectively, as laid down by
the writer in the <i>Dublin Review</i>.<p>

For an instance of a king dethroned, not <i>proprio,
marte</i>, but with every appearance at least of an act
of the whole nation, see the dethronement of
Edward II., as related by Walsingham, <i>Historia
Anglicana</i>, I., pp. 186, 187, Rolls Series.<p>

6. "We save ourselves the more virulent and
destructive diseases of revolution, sedition, and civil
war, by submitting to the milder type of a change of
ministry. (<i>Times</i>, April 7, 1880.)<p>

7. It is not monarchical governments alone that
can ever be resisted lawfully: but what is sauce for
the king's goose is sauce also for the people's
gander. There is no special sanctity attaching to,
democracy.<p>

It might seem that, since resistance requires to.
be justified by the approval of "the larger and
better portion of the people" (n. 4, condition [4])
no just resistance can ever be offered to the will of
the democratic majority. But the said majority
may be in divers ways coerced and cajoled, a mere
packed majority, while the malcontents may be, if
not "the larger," clearly "the better" portion of
the community. (s. iv., n. 5, p. 321.)<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section VIII. -- <i>Of the right of the sword</i>.</h2>

1. By the right of the sword is technically meant
the right of inflicting capital punishment, according
to the Apostle's words: "But if thou do that which
is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain."
(Rom. xiii. 4.) We commonly call it the Power of
life and death.<p>

2. That a government may be a working government, 
as it should be (s. iv., n. 2, p. 319), it must not
only make laws, but bear out and enforce its legislation
by the sanction of punishment. "If talk and argumentation 
were sufficient to make men well-behaved,
manifold and high should be the reward of talkers.
. . . But in fact it appears that talking does very
well to incite and stimulate youths of fine mind;
and lighting upon a noble character and one of
healthy tastes, it may dispose such a person to take
up the practice of virtue: but it is wholly unable to
move the multitude to goodness; for it is not their
nature to obey conscience, but fear, nor to abstain
from evil because it is wrong, but because of punishments. 
The multitude live by feeling: they pursue
the pleasures that they like and the means thereto,
and shun the opposite pains, but they have no idea,
as they have had no taste, of what is right and fair
and truly sweet. . . . The man who lives by feeling
will not listen to the voice of reason, nor can he
appreciate its warning. How is it possible to divert
such a one from his course by argument? Speaking
generally, we say that passion yields not to argument 
but to constraint. . . . The multitude obey on
compulsion rather than on principle, and from fear
of pains and penalties rather than from a sense of
right. These are grounds for believing that legislators, 
while exhorting to virtue and putting certain
courses of conduct forward as right and honourable,
in the expectation that good men will obey the call,
as their habits lead them, should at the same time
inflict chastisements and punishments upon the
crossgrained and disobedient; and as for the 
incurably vicious, put them beyond the pale 
altogether. The result will be, that the decent and
conscientious citizen will listen to the voice of
reason, while the worthless votary of pleasure is
chastened by pain like a beast of burden. . . . Law
has a coercive function, appealing to force, 
notwithstanding that it is a reasoned conclusion of practical
wisdom and intelligence. The interference of persons
is odious, when it stands out against the tide of
passion, even where it is right and proper to interfere; 
but no odium attaches to statute law enjoining
the proper course." (Aristotle, <i>Ethics</i>, X., ix.)<p>

3. Aristotle seems hard upon the masses, likening
them to brutes who must be governed by the whip.
He may be supposed to speak from experience of
the men of his time. If humanity has somewhat
improved in two and twenty centuries, yet it cannot
be contended that the whip is grown unnecessary
and beyond the whip the sword. But we must
observe a certain <i>modus operandi</i> of punishment
which Aristotle has not noted, a more human mode
than the terror of slavish fear. just punishment,
felt as such, stimulates the conscience to discern
and abhor the crime. Men would think little of
outraging their own nature by excess, did they not
know that the laws of God and man forbid such
outrage. Again, they would think little even of those
laws, were not the law borne out by the sanction of
punishment. A law that may be broken with impunity 
is taken to be the toying of a legislator not
in earnest. Men here are as children. A child is
cautioned against lying. He reckons little of the
caution: he tells a lie, and a flogging ensues. 
Thereupon his mind reverts to what he was told: he sees
that the warning was meant in earnest. He reflects
that it must have been a wicked thing, that he
which his father, the object of his fond reverence,
chastises so sternly. If the thing had been let
pass, he would scarcely have regarded it as wicked.
Next time he is more on his guard, not merely
because he fears a beating, but because he understands 
better than before that lying is wrong. The
awe in which grown-up people stand of "a red
judge," is not simple fear, like that which keeps the
wolf from the flock guarded by shepherds and their
dogs: but they are alarmed into reflection upon the
evil which he is God's minister to avenge, and they
are moved to keep the law, "not only for wrath,
but for conscience sake." From this we see that
for punishment to be really salutary, its justice must
be manifest to the culprit, or to the lookers on, at
least in their cooler moments. A punishment the
justice of which is not discernible, may quell for the
moment, but it does not moralise, nor abidingly
deter. There must be an apparent proportion
between the offence and the punishment. A Draconian 
code, visiting petty offences with the severity
due to high misdemeanours, is more of an irritant
than a repressor of crime, because it goes beyond
men's consciences.<p>

4. There is in every human breast a strong sense
of what the learned call <i>lex talionis</i>, and children <i>tit
for tat</i>. "If a man has done to him what he has
done to others, that is the straight course of justice;"
so says the canon of Rhadamanthus, quoted by
Aristotle. (<i>Eth.</i>, V., v., 3.) We have argued the 
fundamental correctness of this rule. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. ix., s. iii.,
n . 2, p. 169.) It appears in the divine direction given
to Noe: " Whoso sheddeth man's blood, his blood
shall be shed." (Gen. ix. 6.) It appears in that
popular sentiment, which in some parts of America
displays itself in the lynching of murderers, who
have unduly escaped the hands of the law; and
which, under a similar paralysis of law in Corsica,
broke out in blood-feuds, whereby the nearest relative 
of the deceased went about to slay the murderer.
Such taking of justice into private bands is morally
unlawful, as we have proved. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. ix., s. iii.,
n. 4, p. 171; <i>Natural Law</i>, c. viii., s. ii., nn. 2, 3,
pp. 308, 309.) It is a violent outburst of a natural
and reasonable sentiment deprived of its legitimate
vent. Unquestionably then there is an apparent and
commonly recognized fairness of retribution in the
infliction of capital punishment for murder. Thus
the first condition of appropriate punishment is
satisfied, that it be <i>manifestly proportioned to the crime</i>.<p>

5. Capital punishment is moreover expedient, nay,
necessary to the State. The right to inflict it is one
of the essential prerogatives of government, one of
those prerogatives the sum of which, as we have seen,
is a constant quantity everywhere. (s. iv., n. 7, p. 322).
No Government can renounce it. The abolition of
capital punishment by law only makes the power of
inflicting it <i>latent</i> in the State (s. iv., n. 8, p. 323) ;
it does not and cannot wholly take the power away.
You ask: Is there not hope, that if humanity goes
on improving as it has done, capital punishment
will become wholly unnecessary? I answer that --
waiving the question of the prospect of improvement --
in a State mainly consisting of God-fearing,
conscientious men, the <i>infliction</i> of capital punish-
ment would rarely be necessary, but the <i>power to inflict
it</i> could never be dispensed with. If men ever
become so ideally virtuous, the right of the State to
visit gross crime with death cannot hurt them, and
it will strengthen their virtue, as all human social
virtue will ever need strengthening.<p>

6. The abiding necessity of this <i>right of the sword</i>
is argued from the strength and frequency of the
provocations to deeds of bloodshed and violence
that must ever be encountered in human society.
What these provocations are, how many and how
strong, may be left to the reflection of the student
who reads his newspaper, or even his novel. Not
the least appalling thing about crime, atrocious
crime especially, is the example that it gives and
the imitators whom it begets. It is not merely that
it sets the perpetrator himself on the downward
path, so that, unless detected and punished, a man's
first deed of blood is rarely his last: it draws others
after him by a fatal fascination. Like the images
which the Epicureans supposed all visible objects
to slough off and shed into the air around them,
such phantoms and images of guilt float about a
great crime, enter into the mind of the spectator
and of the hearer, and there, upon slight occasion,
turn to actual repetitions of the original deed. The
one preventive is to append to that deed a punishment, 
the image of which shall also enter into the
mind, excite horror, and disenchant the recipient.
This is not to be done by mere banishment of the
criminal, nor by his perpetual incarceration. Exile
and prison -- particularly in view of the humanity of
a modern penitentiary -- do not sufficiently strike the
imagination.  One sweet hour of revenge will often
appear cheap at the price of ten years' penal servitude. 
There is nothing goes to the heart like death.  
Death is the most striking of terrors; it is also the
penalty that most exactly counterpoises in the scales
of justice the commission of a murderous crime.
All States need this dread figure of the Sword-bearer
standing at the elbow of the Sovereign.<p>

7. But is not every capital sentence a trespass
upon the dominion of God, Lord of life and death?
No, for that same God it is who has endowed man
with a nature that needs to grow up in civil society,
which civil society again needs for its maintenance
the power to make laws, to sit in judgment on
transgressors, and in extreme cases, as we have
proved, having tried them and found them guilty,
to take away even their lives, to the common terror
and horror of the crime. God, who wills human
nature to be, wills it to be on the terms on which
alone it can be. To that end He has handed over
to the civil ruler so much of His own divine power
of judgment, as shall enable His human delegate to
govern with assurance and effect. That means the
right of the sword.<p>

8. It may be objected that to kill any man is
to treat him as a thing, not a person, as an <i>hetero-centric</i>, 
not an <i>autocentric</i> being, which is a proceeding
essentially unnatural and wrong. (c. ii., s. i., n. 2, p.
203.) St.Thomas's answer here is peculiarly valuable:
"Man by sinning withdraws from the order of
reason, and thereby falls from human dignity, so far
as that consists in man being naturally free and
existent for his own sake [autocentric]; and falls in
a manner into the state of servitude proper to beasts,
according to that of the Psalm (xlviii. 15): <i>Man when
he was in honour did not understand: he hath matched
himself with senseless beasts and become like unto them</i>;
and Proverbs xi. 29: <i>The fool shall serve the wise</i>. And,
therefore, though to kill a man, while he abides in
his native dignity, be a thing of itself evil, yet to kill
a man who is a sinner may be good, as to kill a
beast. For worse is an evil man than a beast, and
more noxious, as the Philosopher says." (2a 2ae,
q 64, art. 2, ad 3.)<p>

Hence observe: -- (1) That a Utilitarian who
denies free will, as many of that school do, stands at
some loss whence to show cause why even an innocent 
man may not be done to death for reasons of
State, <i>e.g.</i>, as a sanitary precaution.
(2) That the State must come to a conclusion
about inward dispositions by presumption from overt
acts, arguing serious moral guilt before proceeding
to capital punishment. To this extent the State is
remotely a judge of sin. But it does not punish sin
retributively as sin, nor even medicinally.  It punishes
the violation of its own laws, to deter future offenders.

<hr><p><h2>Section IX. -- <i>Of War</i>.</h2>

1. War, a science by itself, has no interest for
the philosopher except as an instance on a grand
scale of self-defence. When the theory of self-defence
has been mastered (c. ii. s. ii., p. 208), little further
remains to be said about war.  In a State, the self-defence 
of citizen against citizen is confined to the
moment of immediate physical aggression. But in
a region where the State is powerless and practically
non-existent, self-defence assumes a far greater amplitude. 
(s. ii., n. 2, p. 309.) When the Highland chief
lifted the cattle of the Lowland farmer, and the
King of Scotland lay unconcerned and unable to
intervene, feasting at Holyrood, or fighting on the
English border, then, if there were a fair hope of
recovering the booty without a disproportionate
effusion of blood, the farmer did right to arm his
people, march after the robber, and fight him for
the stolen oxen, as the gallant Baron of Bradwardine
would fain have done. (Waverley, c. xv.) Here is
the right of self-defence in its full development,
including the right of private war. But in a private
individual this is an undesirable, rank, and 
luxuriant growth; and when the individual comes to
live, as it should be his aim to live, in a 
well-organized State, the growth is pruned and cut
down: he may then defend himself for the instant
when the State cannot defend him; but after the
wrong is done, he must hold his hand, and quietly
apply to the State to procure him restitution and
redress. But there is no State of States, no King
of Kings, upon earth; therefore, when of two 
independent States the one has wronged, or is about to
wrong the other, and will not desist nor make
amends, nothing is left for it; Nature has made no
other provision, but they must fight. They must
fall back upon the steel and the shotted gun, the
<i>ratio ultima regum</i>.<p>

2. The Lowland farmer above mentioned might
be spoken of as <i>punishing</i> the Highland robber,
<i>chastising</i> his insolence, and the like. This is popular
phraseology, but it is not accurate. Punishment,
an act of <i>vindictive justice</i>, is from superior to inferior. 
(<i>Ethics</i>, c. v., s. ix., n. 4, p. 104.) War, like other
self-defence, is between equals. War is indeed an
act of authority, of the authority of each belligerent
State over its own subjects, but not of one belligerent
over the other. We are not here considering the
case of putting down a rebellion: rebels are not
properly belligerents, and have no belligerent rights.<p>

3. The study of Civil and Canon Law flourished
in the Middle Ages, while moral science, which is
the study of the Natural Law, was still in its 
infancy.  No wonder that the mediaeval jurists 
occasionally formulated maxims, which can only be
squared with the principles of Natural Law by an
exceeding amount of interpretation, -- which are in
fact much better dropped, quoted though they sometimes 
be by moralists of repute.  One such maxim
is this, that <i>a wrongdoer becomes the subject of the
injured party by reason of the offence</i>. Admit this, and
you can hardly keep clear of Locke's doctrine of the
origin of civil power. (s. ii., <i>per totum</i>, p. 307; cf.
Suarez, <i>De Caritate</i>, d. xiii., s. iv., nn. 5, 6.)<p>

4. We have only to repeat about war what we
said of self-defence, that all the killing that takes
place in it is <i>incidental</i>, or <i>indirect</i>.  The cannon 
that you see in Woolwich Arsenal, the powder and torpedoes, 
have for their end what St. Thomas (<i>De
Potentia</i>, q. 7, art. 2, ad 10) declares to be the end
and object of the soldier, "to upset the foe," to put
him <i>hors de combat</i>. This is accomplished in such
rough and ready fashion, as the business admits of;
by means attended with incidental results of 
extremest horror. But no sooner has the bayonet
thrust or the bullet laid the soldier low, and 
converted him into a non-combatant, than the 
ambulance men are forward to see that he shall not die.
If indeed even in the dust he continues to be aggressive, 
like the wounded Arabs at Tel-el-Kebir, he
must be quieted and repressed a second time.
Probably he will not escape with life from a second
repression: still, speaking with philosophic precision,
we must say that "to quiet, not to kill him," is, or
should be, the precise and formal object of the will
of his slayer in war.  St. Thomas indeed (2a 2ae,
q. 64, art. 7, in corp.) seems to allow the soldier
fighting against the enemy to mean to kill his man.
But by enemy in this passage we should probably
understand rebel. The soldier spoken of is the in.
strument of the feudal lord bringing back to duty
his rebellious vassal. In the Middle Ages, till the
end of the fifteenth century, the notion of 
independent nations scarcely found place.
In war, as all cases of self-defence, the killing
is indirect. In capital punishment, on the other
hand, the killing is direct: it being chosen as a 
deterrent means, that the offender be "hanged by the
neck" till he is "dead, dead, dead." This disposes
of the error, that capital punishment is an act of
self-defence on the part of the State against 
evildoers. We may observe finally that by the right
of the sword, and by that alone, not in self-defence,
not in war, but by the hand of public justice raised
against a guilty subject, can human life ever be
taken directly.<p>

<i>Reading</i>. -- St. Thos., 2a 2ae, q. 40, art. 1.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section X. -- <i>Of the Scope and Aim of Civil Government.</i></h2>

1. I beseech the pious leader not to be shocked
and scandalised by the conclusions of this section.
He will find them in the end a valuable support to
theology. The most religious mind can have no
difficulty in allowing that cookery, as such, is a
business of this world only: that you retain your
cook, not to save your soul, but to prepare palatable
and wholesome nourishment for your body; that
honesty, sobriety, and good temper are officially
requisite qualifications, simply inasmuch as the
contrary vices would be the plague of your kitchen
and the spoiling of your dinner. In a Catholic
house the soup on a Friday is made without meat.
That restriction is observed, not as a point of
culinary art, but because, whereas eternal salvation
is the main end of life, and cookery a subordinate
end, the latter must be so prosecuted as not to
interfere with the former.  She who uses ingredients
forbidden by the Church, is the worse Christian,
but she may be the better cook.  Now, to compare
a great thing with a little, the State equally with the
kitchen is a creation of this world, -- there are no
nationalities, nor kitchen-ranges either, beyond the
grave. Civil government is a secular concern. The
scope and aim intrinsic to it, and attainable by its
own proper forces, is a certain temporal good.
Suarez (<i>De Legibus</i>, III., xi., 7) sets forth that good
to be, -- "the natural happiness of the perfect human
community, whereof the civil legislature has the
care, and the happiness of individuals as they are
members of such of a community, that they may
live therein peaceably and justly, and with a 
sufficiency of goods for the preservation and comfort of
their bodily life, and with so much moral rectitude
as is necessary for this external peace and happiness
of the commonwealth and the continued preservation
of human nature."<p>

2. The intrinsic scope and aim of civil government 
is the good of the citizens as citizens. That,
we have to show, is not any good of the. world to
come; nor again the full measure of good requisite
for individual well-being in this world. The good
of the citizens as such is that which they enjoy in
common in their social and political capacity:
namely, security, wealth, liberty, commerce, the arts
of life, arms, glory, empire, sanitation, and the like,
all which goods, of their own nature, reach not
beyond this world. True, a certain measure of
moral rectitude also is maintained in common, but
only "so much as is necessary for the external
peace and happiness of the commonwealth," not
that rectitude of the whole man which is required
in view of the world to come. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. x., n. 4 [3],
p. 182.) The intrinsic aim of the State, then, falls short
of the next life. Neither does it cover the entire good
of the individual even for this life. The good of
the State, and of each citizen as a citizen, which it
is the purpose of civil government to procure, is a
mere grand outline, within which every man has to
fill in for himself the little square of his own personal
perfection and happiness. Happiness, as we have
seen, lies essentially in inward acts. The conditions
of these acts outward tranquillity and order, are
the statesman's care: the acts themselves must be
elicited by each individual from his own heart.
Happiness also depends greatly on domestic life,
the details of which, at least when they stop short
of wife-beating, come not within the cognisance of,
the civil power. It remains, as we have said, that
the scope and aim of the State, within its own
sphere and the compass of its own powers, is the
temporal prosperity of the body politic, and the
prosperity of its members as they are its members
and citizens, but not absolutely as they are men.
We cannot repeat too often the saying of St. Thomas:
"Man is not ordained to the political commonwealth
to the full extent of all that he is and has." (1a 2ae,
q.21, art. 4, ad 3.)<p>

3. From this view it appears that the end for
which the State exists is indeed an important and
necessary good, but it is not all in all to man, not
his perfect and final happiness. To guide man to
that is the office of the Christian Church in the
present order of Providence. Cook and statesman
must so go about the proper ends of their several
offices, as not to stand in the way of the Church,
compassing as she does that supreme end to which
all other ends are subordinate. This limitation they
are bound to observe, not as cook and statesman,
but as men and Christians. A perfectly Christian
State, as Christian, has a twofold duty. First, it
has a Positive duty, at the request of the Church, to
follow up ecclesiastical laws with corresponding civil
enactments, <i>e.g.</i>, laws against criminous clerks and
excommunicates.  On this spiritual ground, being
beyond its jurisdiction, the State must be careful
not to forestall but to second the precept of spiritual
authority. It is no business of the State, as such,
to punish a purely religious offence. The second
duty of a Christian State, and a more urgent duty
even than the former, is the negative one of making
no civil enactment to the prejudice of the Church:
<i>e.g.</i>, not to subject clerics to the law of conscription.
Useful as their arms might be for the defence of the
country, the State must forego that utility for the
sake of a higher end.<p>

4. In the order of pure nature, which is the order
of philosophy, there is of course no Church. Still
there would be, as we have seen (c. i., s. i., n. 8,
p. 197), erected on the same lines as the civil power,
and working side by side with it, a religious power
competent to prescribe and conduct divine worship.
This power the State would be bound to abet and
support, both positively and negatively; something in
the same manner, but not to the same degree, as the
Christian State is bound to abet the Church. The
supreme direction of the natural religious power
would conveniently be vested in the person of the
Civil Ruler. Thus the Roman Emperor was also
Chief Pontiff.<p>

5. How in the mere natural, as distinguished from
the Christian order, the provinces of marriage and
education should be divided between the civil and
the religious power, is perhaps not a very profitable
enquiry. The only use of it is a polemic use in
arguing with men of no Christianity. Among all,
men of any religion, marriage has ever been regarded 
as one of those occasions of life that bring
man into special relation with God, and therefore
into some dependence on God's ministers. Education, 
again, has a religious element, to be superintended 
by the religious power. Education has a
secular element also, the general superintendence of
which cannot be denied to the State. Though
children are facts of the domestic order, and the
care and formation of them belongs primarily to
their parents, yet if the parents neglect their charge,
the State can claim the right of intervention <i>ab abusu</i>.
It certainly is within the province of the State to
prevent any parent from launching upon the world
a brood of young barbarians; ready to disturb the
peace of civil society. The practical issue is, who
are barbarians and what is understood by peace.  The
Emperor Decius probably considered every Christian
child an enemy of the <i>Pax Romana</i>. But the 
misapplication of a maxim does not derogate from its
truth. It also belongs to the State to see that no
parent behaves like a Cyclops (<b>kukl&ocirc;pik&ocirc;s</b>, Ar., 
<i>Eth.</i>, X., ix., 13) in his family, ordering his children, not
to their good, as a father is bound to do, but to his
own tyrannical caprice.  For instruction, as distinguished 
from education, it is the parent's duty to
provide his child with so much of it as is necessary,
in the state of society wherein his lot is cast, to
enable the child to make his way in the world according 
to the condition of his father. In many walks of
life one might as well be short of a finger as not
know how to read and write. Where ignorance is
such a disadvantage, the parent is not allowed to let
his child grow up ignorant. There, if he neglects to
have him taught, the State may step in with compulsory 
schooling. Compulsory schooling for all
indiscriminately, and that up to a high standard, is
quite another matter.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section XI. -- <i>Of Law and Liberty</i>.</h2>

1. The student of Natural Law does not share
the vulgar prejudice against civil law and lawyers.
He knows it for a precept of the Natural Law, that
there should be a State set up, and that this State
should proceed to positive legislation. This legislation 
partly coincides with Natural Law in urging the 
practice of that limited measure of morality, which
is necessary for the State to do its office and to be
at all. (s. x., n. 2, p. 355.) This partial enforcement
of the Law of Nature is the main work of the
criminal law of the State.  But State legislation goes
beyond the Natural Law, and in the nature of things
must go beyond it. Natural Law leaves a thousand
conflicting rights undetermined, which in the interest
of society, to save quarrels, must be determined
one way or another.<p>

2. An illustration. It is an axiom of Natural Law,
that <i>res perit domino</i>, that is, the owner bears the
loss.  If an article under sale perishes before delivery,
the loss falls, apart from contracts to the contrary,
upon whichever of the two parties is the owner at
the time.  So far nature rules.  But who is the
owner at any given time, and at what stage of the
transaction does the dominion pass? That can only
be settled by custom and the law of the land. "If
I order a pipe of port from a wine-merchant abroad;
at what period the property passes from the merchant 
to me; whether upon delivery of the wine at
the merchant's warehouse; upon its being put on
shipboard at Oporto; upon the arrival of the ship in
England at its destined port; or not till the wine be
committed to my servants, or deposited in my cellar;
all are questions which admit of no decision but what
custom points out." (Paley, <i>Mor.  Phil</i>., bk. iii., p.
C. vii.)<p>

This leads us to remark upon the much admired
sentence of Tacitus, <i>in corruptissima republica 
plurimae leges</i>, that not merely the multitude of 
transgressions, but the very complexity of a highly developed
civilization, requires to be kept in order by a vast
body of positive law.<p>

3. Incidentally we may also remark, that the law
of the State does not create the right of property;
otherwise, abolishing its own creation, the State
could bring in Communism. (c. vii., s. i., p. 278.)
But finding this right of property unprotected and
undetermined, the State by its criminal law protects
property against robbers, and by its <i>civil</i> as 
distinguished from <i>criminal</i> law, it defines numerous
open questions between possessors as to manner of
acquirement and conditions of tenure.<p>

4. All civil laws bind the conscience: some by
way of a categorical imperative, <i>Do this</i>: others by
way of a disjunctive, <i>Do this, or being caught acting
otherwise, submit to the Penalty</i>. The latter are called
<i>purely penal laws</i>, an expression, by the way, which
has no reference to the days of religious persecution.  
Civil law binds the conscience categorically whenever
the civil ruler so intends.  In the absence of express
declaration, it must be presumed that he so intends
whenever his law is an enforcement of the Natural
Law, or a determination of the same; as when the
observance is necessary to the preservation of the
State, or when the ruler determines what lapse of
time shall be necessary for the acquisition of property
by prescription. Very frequently, the parties to a
contract tacitly accept the dispositions of the civil
law as forming part of their agreement; and in this
indirect fashion the civil law becomes binding on the
conscience. In this way an Englishman who accepts
a bill of exchange tacitly binds himself to pay interest
at five per cent., if the bill is not met at maturity, for
such is the disposition of the English Law. It may
be further observed that no prudent legislator would
attach a severe penalty to what was not already
wrong.<p>

5. In Roman times it was part of the flattery of
the imperial jurists to their master, to tell him that
he was above the laws, <i>legibus solutus</i>. In the trial
of Louis XVI., the Sovereign People, or they who
called themselves such, dispensed with certain legal
formalities on that same plea. Against the law at
Athens, the generals who had fought at Arginusae
were condemned by one collective sentence, the
anger of the Sovereign People being too impatient
to vote on them separately, as the law required.  
Hereupon we must observe in the first place, that
the Supreme Ruler, whether one man or a multitude,
can never be brought to trial in his own court for
any legal offence. As all justice requires two terms:
no power can do justice on itself. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. v., s. ix.,
n. i, p. 102.) This truth is embodied in the English
maxim, that <i>the king can do no wrong</i>.  Again, the
Sovereign is either expressly or virtually exempted
from the compass of many laws, <i>e.g.</i> those which
concern the flying of certain flags or ensigns, and
other petty matters. Thirdly, we have the principle,
that no being can give a law to himself. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. vi.
s. ii., n. 3, p. 17.) Lastly, we must observe that there
is no law so fundamental but what the Supreme
Power, taken in its entirety, can alter it, and by 
consequence dispense from it. From these considerations 
it follows that the Sovereign -- the complete and
absolute Sovereign, be he one man or many -- lies
under no legal obligation to obey any law of his own
making as such.  It does not follow that he is perfectly
free to ignore the laws. He is bound in conscience
and before God to make his government effectual; and
effectual it cannot be, if the laws are despised; and
despised they will be, if the Sovereign gives scandal
by ignoring them in his own practice.  Therefore
the Sovereign, be he King, Council, or Assembly, is
bound in conscience and before God, though not
legally of his own jurisdiction, so far himself to stand
to the observance of the law as not to render it
nugatory in the eyes and practice of others.<p>

6. Law and liberty are like the strings and
meshes of a net. In the one limit of minimum of
mesh, the net passes into sack-cloth, where nothing
could get through. In the other limit of maximum
of mesh, the net vanishes, and everything would get
through. We cannot praise in the abstract either a
large mesh or a small one: the right size is according
to the purpose for which the net is to be used in each
particular case. So neither can law nor liberty be
praised, as Burke says, "on a simple view of the
subject, as it stands stripped of every relation, in all
the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction." 
We can only praise either as it is "clothed
in circumstances." Commonly we are led to praise
the one by getting too much of the other. 
Confounded in a tangle of fussy, vexatious, perhaps
malicious restrictions, men cry loudly for liberty.
When people all about us are doing things by their
own sweet will, we are converted to praise of 
regulation and discipline and the wholesome restraint of
law.<p>

<i>Seven Lamps of Architecture</i>, c. vii., ## 1, 2.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section XII. <i>Of Liberty of Opinion</i>.</h2>

1. We are here dealing with liberty only so far
as it means exemption from State control. So far as
the State is concerned, a man has the fullest liberty
to hold in his heart the most seditious opinions,
and to think the foulest thoughts, so long as they
do not appear in his public language and conduct.
The heart is free from all mere human law, resting
in subjection to His law alone, and in responsibility
to His judgment, who is the Searcher of Hearts.<p>

2. We are dealing then not properly with
opinion, but with the public expression of opinion.
We are dealing with that expression as controllable
by the State, not acting in deference to the invitation
of any religious power, but of its own initiative and
proper authority, in view of its own end, scope and
aim, which is social order and public prosperity for
this life. (s. x., nn. 2, 3, p. 355.)<p>

3. That there are doctrines dangerous to social
order, cannot be denied, unless we are to cease to
believe in any influence of thought upon conduct.
It is important to the State, that men should have
the greatest possible horror of crime. (s. viii., nn. 3, 6,
pp. 345, 348.) This horror is notably impaired
when all idea of sin is taken away. Now the idea
of sin vanishes with that of God. (<i>Ethics</i>, c, vi
s. ii., nn. 6, 7, 13, pp.  119, 123.) Therefore to pull
down the idea of God among a nation of theists,
whether by the wiles of a courtly Professor at a
University, or by the tub-thumping blasphemy of
an itinerant lecturer, is to injure the State. The
tub-thumper however is the more easily reached by
the civil authority, especially when his discourses
raise a tumult among the people. But where attacks
upon theism have become common, and unbelief is
already rampant among the masses, for the State to
interfere with either "leader of thought," high or
low, would be a shutting of the stable-door after the.
steed was stolen. Similarly we should speak of
those who subvert the received notions touching the
sanctity of the marriage-tie and the law of external
purity gencrally, the obligation of civil allegiance, the
rights of property and of life.<p>

4. It will be objected: "The doctrines that you
wish to express as inimical to the peace of the
commonwealth, possibly may be true. Did not the
first heralds of Christianity trouble the peace of the
Roman world?" We reply: Let the new teachers
come to us as those apostolic men came, "in weakness 
and in fear and in much trembling," and yet
withal "in the showing of the spirit and power,"
with an "exhortation not of uncleanness," nor upon
"an occasion of covetousness," " holily and justly
and without blame" (1 Cor. ii. 3, 4; 1 Thess. ii. 3,
5, 10); and we will receive them as angels of God,
even to the plucking out of our own eyes, if need be,
and giving to them. (Gal. iv. 15.) Any hostile 
reception that they may meet with at first from a 
misapplication of our principle, will soon be made up
for by welcome and veneration. There is no principle
that may not be momentarily misapplied in all good
faith. But the mistake in this case will readily be
rectified.<p>

5. But, writes J. S. Mill, <i>On Liberty</i>, "we can
never be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring
to stifle is a false opinion." If we cannot, then is
there no such thing as certainty upon any point of
morals, politics, or religion. Assassination of tyrants,
whether in public or private life, may be wickedness,
or it maybe a laudable outburst of public spirit, who
knows? Which of us is sure that all property is not
theft? Plato's views on marriage and infanticide
may be correct: the Nihilist may be your true
politician; and all our religious knowledge dwindles
down to the confession of Protagoras: "Concerning
Gods, I find no clear evidence whether they are or
are not, or what manner of beings they are." These
are the sceptical tremors which this denial induces.  
But even scepticism has its proof, which Mill
furnishes as follows: "All silencing of discussion is
an assumption of infallibility." The very name 
<i>infallibility</i> has an effect upon the modern Englishman
like that of <i>Popery</i> upon his forefathers.  It shakes
his nerves, obscures his judgment, and scares his
seated reason to leap up from her throne. But after
we have recovered from our fright, we recollect that,
whereas infallibility is an all-round attribute, 
compassing an entire subject, certainty goes out to one
particular point on the circumference; we may then
be certain without being infallible. Extremely fallible
as I am in geography, I am nevertheless certain that
Tunis is in Africa.  Silencing discussion is an assumption, 
not of infallibility, but of certainty. The man
who never dares assume that he is certain of anything, 
so certain as to close his ears to all further
discussion, comes nothing short of a universal
sceptic.<p>

6. We are told, free discussion Promotes discovery. 
Yes, free discussion in philosophical circles,
free discussion among competent persons.  But free
discussion of a subject among the incompetent and
the incapable, and the passionate and the prejudiced,
is not good for the cause of truth; and if the subject
be practical and momentous, it is not good for the
disputants either, nor for the community. If we
allow that the science and practice of morality is
not advanced by free debate of ethical questions in
nurseries and boarding-schools, we must also bear
in mind that a vast proportion of the human family
remain all their lives long, for the purpose of such
discussions, as incompetent as children. The multitude 
cannot be philosophers. They have neither
time, nor intelligence, nor love of hard thinking
sufficient to arrive at the final and adequate <i>why</i>
and <i>wherefore</i> of their every duty. Though capable
of doing right, they are quite incapable of doing so
philosophically. They do it according as they are
led by custom and authority. Their inheritance is
the traditionary wisdom of mankind, which they live
upon as an infant on his estate, not understanding
whence their support comes. It is dangerous to
batter them with objections against the received
moral law.  You will overthrow them, not confirm
them by the result of your reasonings: you will
perplex their intellect, you will confound their good
purpose, you will awaken their evil passions. Surely
it is a more necessary point to secure that right be
done somehow, than that it be philosophically done.
The one is difficult enough, the other quite impossible
for the mass of mankind. Therefore, adapting to
our purpose the old Greek oracle: "let us not disturb
the foundations of popular morality: they are better
undisturbed" -- <b>M&ecirc; kinei Kamarinan akin&ecirc;tos
gar amein&ocirc;n</b>.<p>

7. But is it not immoral to interfere with conscience, 
and to attempt to stifle sincere convictions?
The State, we repeat, has nothing to do with 
conscience as such, nor with the inward convictions of
any man. But if the State is sincerely convinced,
that the convictions openly professed and propagated
by some of its subjects are subversive of social order
and public morality, whose sincere conviction is it
that must carry the day in practice? It is of the
essence of government that the convictions, sincere
or otherwise, of the governed shall on certain
practical issues be waived in the external observance
in favour of the convictions of the ruling power.
After all, this talk of conscience and sincere convictions 
is but the canting phrase of the day, according
to which conscience means mere wild humour and
headstrong self-will.  Such teachings as those which
we would have the State to suppress, <i>e.g.: An oath
is a folly: There is no law of Purity: There is no harm
in doing anything that does not annoy your neighbour:</i>
are not the teachings of men sincerely convinced:
they deserve no respect, consideration, or tenderness
on that score. We do not say, that the teachers of
these monstrosities are not convinced, but that they
are not honestly and conscientiously convinced: they
have blinded themselves, and become the guilty
authors of their own delusion. Not all strong 
convictions are honestly come by or virtuously 
entertained.<p>

8. Arraigned for their utterances, men protest
their sincerity, as parties indicted for murder do
their innocence. We can set but small store by
such protestations. It is a question of evidence to
come from other sources than from the accused
person's own mouth. A man indeed must be held
to be sincere until he is proved to be the contrary.
That is the general rule. But there are what Roman
lawyers call <i>praesumptiones juris</i>; circumstances which,
if proved, will induce the court to take a certain view
of a case, and give judgment accordingly, unless by
further evidence that view is proved to be a false one.
Now when a man proclaims some blatant and
atrocious error in a matter bearing directly upon
public morals -- and it is for the restraint of these
errors alone that we are arguing -- there is a decided
<i>praesumptio juris</i>, that the error in him, however
doggedly he maintains it, is not a sincere, candid,
and innocently formed conviction. The light of
nature is not so feeble as that, among civilized men.
Let the offender be admonished and given time to
think: but if, for all warning to the contrary, the
wilful man will have his way, and still propagate his
error to the confusion of society, he must be treated
like any other virtuous and well-meaning criminal --
he Must be restrained and coerced to the extent that
the interests of society require.<p>

9. At the same time it must be confessed that
when an error, however flagrant and pestilential, has
ceased to shock and scandalize the general body
of the commonwealth: when the people listen to
the doctrine without indignation, and their worst
sentence upon it pronounces it merely "queer,"
there is little hope of legal restraints there enduring
long or effecting much. Penalties for the expression
of opinion are available only so far as they tally with
the common feeling of the country. When public
opinion ceases to bear them out, it is better not to
enforce them: for that were but to provoke resentment 
and make martyrs. No regulations can be
maintained except in a congenial atmosphere.
Allowance too must be made for the danger of
driving the evil to burrow underground.<p>

10. The censorship of opinions even in a model
State would vary in method according to men and
times. The censorship of the Press in particular
might be either by <i>Imprimatur</i> required before printing, 
or by liability to prosecution after. The <i>Imprimatur</i> 
might be either for all books, or only for a
certain class. It might be either obligatory, or
merely matter of counsel, to obtain it. We are not
to adopt promiscuously all the praiseworthy 
institutions of our forefathers.<p>
