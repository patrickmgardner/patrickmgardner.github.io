<h1>Chapter V.  Of Rights.</h1>

<hr><p><h2>Section I.  <i>Of the definition and division of Rights</i>.</h2>

1. A <i>right</i> is that in virtue of which a person calls
anything his own. More elaborately, a right is a
<i>moral power residing in a Person, in virtue whereof he
refers to himself as well his own actions as also other
things, which stand referred to him in preference to other
persons</i>.  A right is a moral power, as distinguished
from physical force or ability. It resides in a <i>person</i>, a
being whom we call <i>autocentric</i>, as distinguished from
a <i>thing</i>, which is <i>heterocentric</i>. (c. ii., s. i., n. 2, p. 203.)
A person is his own, a thing is another's.  Every
intellectual nature is a person except the Humanity
of Christ, an exception which does not concern us
here. To the Creator all created personalities are
as things, but that again is not our concern in this
place, where we treat of the relations between man
and man. It will have to be noted hereafter with
great emphasis, that the <i>individual</i> man is a <i>person</i>,
not a thing and chattel, in relation to the <i>State</i>, and
consequently has rights against the State.<p>

2. Every intellectual being has the attribute of
<i>reflex consciousness</i>. It may turn its regard in upon
itself, and call itself <i>me</i>, and its powers and activities
<i>mine</i>.  It certainly has the physical ability of acting
for self, and using its powers consciously for its own
ends. Does this physical ability represent also a
<i>moral power</i>? Is the agent justified in exercising
it? and are his fellows under a moral obligation
of justice to leave him free to exercise it? (<i>Ethics</i>, c.
vi., s. i., nn. 5. 6, p. iii.) We have seen that morality
consists in acting up to one's own intellectual or
rational nature. Since then the calling oneself
<i>me</i>, and one's power <i>mine</i>, and the using those
powers for purposes which one's reason approves,
is the distinguishing feature of an intellectual, or
rational, and personal being, that being is morally
warranted so to act. He calls himself his own, and
his powers his own, and they are his own by the
very fact of his calling them so by a natural act.
And, as justice is to give to another his own, others
are bound in justice to leave him free to dispose of
himself and his powers, at least within certain
limits. But this would be for man a barren 
freedom, were he not empowered to lay hold of and
make his own some things, nay many things, outside 
of himself, for man is not self-sufficient, but
has many natural necessities, and many psychical
cravings to boot. Therefore man's right of 
preference extends, not only to his own actions, but
also to external things, which he may make his own
to act upon.<p>

3. Rights are either <i>connatural</i> or <i>acquired</i>.
Connatural rights spring from the very being of a man,
as he is a person. Such are the rights to life, to
honour, to personal liberty -- that is, freedom to go
where you will -- to civil liberty -- that is, not being
a slave -- also the rights to marry and to acquire
property. Acquired rights spring from some deed
of man, annexing something to his personality.
Such are the rights to property, duly entered upon,
to reputation, to the political franchise, and all
rights that come by contract. Acquired rights may
descend to heirs.<p>

4. Rights again are <i>alienable</i> and <i>inalienable</i>,
which division does not coincide with the preceding. 
Those rights are inalienable, shorn of which
a man cannot work out his last end. Some rights
are thus permanently and universally inalienable,
as the right to life: others are so occasionally and
for particular persons.<p>

5. The correlative of <i>right</i> is <i>duty</i>: so that, 
wherever one man has a right, his neighbours have a
duty in justice to leave him free to exercise the
same. But the converse is not true, that wherever
one Man has a duty towards another, that other
has a right to its performance, for there are duties
of charity, which do not impart a corresponding
right, but only a <i>claim</i>. <i>Duties</i> that correspond
to <i>rights</i> are called by English moralists <i>perfect</i>
duties.  <i>Duties</i> answering to <i>claims</i> only they call
<i>imperfect</i>.<p>

6. Of duties, some are <i>positive</i>, which bind <i>always,
not for always</i>, as the duty of adoring God. We
are always bound to adore, we are not bound to be
always adoring. Other duties are negative, and
bind <i>always, for always</i>, as the duties of sobriety
and chastity.  The former class of duties we may
more easily be excused from, because they can be
deferred, and it is at times morally impossible to
take them up. But negative duty, as Mr. Gladstone
has finely said, "rises with us in the morning, and
goes to rest with us at night: it is the shadow that
follows us wheresoever we go, and only leaves us
when we leave the light of life."<p>

7. Only a <i>person</i> has rights, as appears by the
definition of a <i>right</i>. Again, only persons have
duties, for they only have free will. No one has
duties without rights, and no man has rights 
without duties. Infants and idiots, in whom the use of
reason is impeded, having notwithstanding rights,
are said to have duties also <i>radically</i>. Hence it is
wrong to make an idiot commit what is in him a
<i>material</i> breach of some negative duty, as of 
temperance. Positive duties he is excused from.<p>

8. Some have taught that all human rights are
consequences of duties; a man having first a duty
to perform, and then a right to the means necessary
to its performance. But this doctrine appears more
pious than probable. For, first, the type and
example of sovereign right, God, has no duties.
(<i>Ethics</i>, c. vi., s. ii., n. 4, p. 130.) Then again, a
man may have a right conjoined with a duty -- not
of justice, of course, but of some other virtue, as
of religion -- not to use that right. But if rights
were consequent upon duties, the right would cease
in such a case; and to pretend to exercise it would
be a sin against justice, which it is not.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- <i>Of the so-called Rights of Animals</i>.</h2>

1. Brute beasts, not having understanding and
therefore not being persons, cannot have any rights.
The conclusion is clear. They are not autocentric.
They are of the number of <i>things</i>, which are another's:
they are chattels, or cattle. We have no duties to
them, -- not of justice, as is shown; not of religion,
unless we are to worship them, like the Egyptians of
old; not of fidelity, for they are incapable of 
accepting a promise. The only question can be of charity.
Have we duties of charity to the lower animals?
Charity is an extension of the love of ourselves to
beings like ourselves, in view of our common nature
and our common destiny to happiness in God. (c. iv.,
nn. 1, 2, p. 239.) It is not for the present treatise
to prove, but to assume, that our nature is not
common to brute beasts but immeasurably above
theirs, higher indeed above them than we are
below the angels. Man alone speaks, man alone
hopes to Contemplate for ever, if not -- in the natural
order -- the Face of his Father in Heaven, at least
the reflected brightness of that Divine Face. (<i>Ethics</i>,
c. ii., s. iv., nn. 3, 4.) We have then no duties
of charity, nor duties of any kind, to the lower
animals, as neither to stocks and stones.<p>

2. Still we have duties about stones, not to fling
them through our neighbour's windows; and we
have duties about brute beasts. We must not harm
them, when they are our neighbour's property.
We must not break out into paroxysms of rage and
impatience in dealing with them. It is a miserable
way of showing off human pre-eminence, to torture
poor brutes in malevolent glee at their pain and
helplessness. Such wanton cruelty is especially
deplorable, because it disposes the perpetrators to
be cruel also to men. As St. Thomas says (1a 2ae,
q. 102, art. 6, ad 8):<p>

     "Because the passion of pity arises from the
afflictions of others, and it happens even to brute
animals to feel pain, the affection of pity may
arise in man even about the afflictions of animals.
Obviously, whoever is practised in the affection of
pity towards animals, is thereby more disposed to
the affection of pity towards men: whence it is said
in Proverbs xii. 10: 'The just regardeth the lives of
his beasts, but the bowels of the wicked are cruel.'
And therefore the Lord, seeing the Jewish people to
be cruel, that He might reclaim them to pity, wished
to train them to pity even towards brute beasts, 
forbidding certain things to be done to animals which
seem to touch upon cruelty. And therefore He
forbade them to seethe the kid in the mother's
milk (Deut. xiv. 21), or to muzzle the treading
ox (Dent. xxv. 4), or to kill the old bird with the
young." (Deut. xxii. 6, 7.)<p>

3. It is wanton cruelty to vex and annoy a brute
beast for sport.  This is unworthy of man, and
disposes him to inhumanity towards his own species.
Yet the converse is not to be relied on: there have
been cruel men who have made pets of the brute
creation. But there is no shadow of evil resting on
the practice of causing pain to brutes in sport, where
the pain is not the sport itself, but an incidental
concomitant of it.  Much more in all that conduces
to the sustenance of man may we give pain to
brutes, as also in the pursuit of science. Nor are
we bound to any anxious care to make this pain as
little as may be.  Brutes are as things in our regard:
so far as they are useful to us, they exist for us,
not for themselves; and we do right in using them
unsparingly for our need and convenience, though
not for our wantonness. If then any special case
of pain to a br ute creature be a fact of considerable
value for observation in biological science or the
medical art, no reasoned considerations of morality
can stand in the way of man making the experiment,
yet so that even in the quest of science he be mindful
of mercy.<p>

4. Altogether it will be found that a sedulous
observance of the rights and claims of other men,
a mastery over one's own passions, and a reverence
for the Creator, give the best assurance of a wise
and humane treatment of the lower animals. But
to preach kindness to brutes as a primary obligation,
and capital point of amendment in the conversion
of a sinner, is to treat the symptom and leave 
unchecked the inward malady.<p>

<i>Reading</i>. -- St. Thos., 2a 2ae, q. 25, art. 3.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section III. -- <i>Of the right to Honour and Reputation</i>.</h2>

1. <i>Honour</i> is the attestation of another's excellence. 
<i>Reputation</i> is the opinion of many touching
another's life and conduct. Honour is paid to a
man to his face, whereas his reputation is bruited
behind his back. Honour is taken away by <i>insult</i>,
reputation by <i>detraction</i>. If the detraction involve a
falsehood, it is called <i>calumny</i> or <i>slander</i>.  The name
backbiting, given to detraction, points to the absence
of the person spoken of. But no one meets with
an insult except where he is present, either in person
or by his representative.<p>

2. Both honour and reputation are goods that
a man can call his own, and has a right to, but on
different titles. Honour, some honour at least,
appertains to a man simply for his being a man:
reputation is won by deeds. Honour is primarily a
connatural right: reputation is acquired. An entire
stranger has no reputation, but a certain honour is
his due to start with.<p>

3. As there is a right to honour and a right to
reputation, so insult and detraction are sins, not
against charity, but against commutative justice,
calling for restitution. (<i>Ethics</i>, c. v., s. ix., n. 6, p. 106.)
We must tender an apology for an insult, and labour
to restore the good name that our detracting tongue
has taken away.<p>

4. Calumny is a double sin, one sin against
truth, and another sin, the heavier of the two,
against justice. If the blackening tale be true, the
first sin is absent, but the second is there. The
truth of the story is no justification for our publishing 
it. Though it is wrong to lie, it is not always
right to blurt out the truth, especially when we are
not asked for it. There are unprofitable disclosures,
unseasonable, harmful, and wrongful. But, it will
be said, does not a man forego his right to reputation 
by doing the evil that belies his fair fame ? No,
his right remains, unless the evil that he does, either
of its own proper working or by the scandal that it
gives, be subversive of social order. If he has 
committed a crime against society, he is to be denounced
to the authorities who have charge of society: they
will judge him, and, finding him guilty, they will
punish him and brand him with infamy. If, again,
he does evil, though not immediately against society,
yet in the face of society and before the sun; he
shocks the public conscience and rends his own
reputation. But the evil private and proper to 
himself that any man works in secret, is not society's
care, nor affects his social standing, nor brings any
rightful diminution to his good name. If all our
secret and personal offences are liable to be made
public by any observer, which of us shall abide it?
Our character is our public character; and that is
not forfeit except for some manner of public sin.<p>

5. Suppose a veteran, long retired, has made a
name for military prowess by boasting of battles
wherein he never came into danger, is the one old
comrade who remembers him for a skulker and a
runaway, justified in showing him up? No, for that
reputation, however mendaciously got together, is
still truly a good possession: it is not a fruit of
injustice, therefore it is no matter of restitution:
nor is it any instrument of injustice, which the
holder is bound to drop: thus, as he is not bound
to forego it, now that he has got it, so his 
neighbour may not rightfully take it from him.<p>

<i>Reading</i>. -- St.Thos., 2a 2ae, q. 73, art. 1.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section IV. -- <i>Of Contracts</i>.</h2>

1. A <i>contract</i> is a bargain productive of an 
obligation of commutative justice in each of the 
contracting parties. A <i>bargain</i> is a consent of two 
wills to the same object.  Thus a promise, before it is
accepted, is not a bargain. But even after acceptance 
a promise is not a contract, for the promiser
may not choose to bind himself in justice, but only
in good faith, while the promisee is under no 
obligation whatever.<p>

2. There are such things as <i>implicit contract</i>,
attached to the bearing of certain offices, whereby a
man becomes his brother's keeper. The liability
contracted is limited by the nature of the office:
thus a physician is officially bound in justice as to
his patient's pulse, but not officially as to his purse.
Where there is no explicit contract, the duties which
the subjects of a person's official care have towards
him are not duties of commutative justice.  Thus
these <i>implicit contracts</i> are not strictly contracts, as
failing to carry a full reciprocity. <p>

3. Contracts are either <i>consensual</i> or <i>real</i>, 
according as they are either complete by the mere consent
of the parties, or further require that something 
should change hands and pass from one to the
other. What contracts are consensual, and what
real, depends chiefly on positive law.  No natural
law can tell whether buying and selling, for instance,
be a consensual or a real contract. The interest of
this particular case is when the goods are lost in
transmission: then whichever of the two parties at
the time be determined to be the owner, apart from
culpable negligence or contrary agreement of the
sender, he bears the loss, on the principle, <i>res perit
domino</i>.<p>

4. Contracts are otherwise divided as <i>onerous</i>
and <i>gratuitous</i>. In an onerous contract either party
renders some advantage in return for the advantage
that he receives, as when Titius hires the horse of
Caius. In a gratuitous contract all the advantage
is on one side, as when Titius does not hire but
borrows a horse. The Roman lawyers further
distinguish contracts, somewhat humorously, into
<i>contracts with names</i> and <i>contracts without names</i>, or
<i>nominate</i> and <i>innominate</i>, as anatomists name a
certain bone the <i>innominate</i> bone, and a certain
artery <i>the innominate artery. Innominate contracts</i>
are reckoned four: <i>I give on the terms of your giving</i>
otherwise than as buying and selling, -- to some
forms of this there are English names, as <i>exchange</i>
and <i>barter: I do on the terms of your doing: I do on
the terms of your giving: I give on the terms of your
doing</i>.<p>

<i>Readings</i>. -- De Lugo, <i>De Just et Jure</i>, 22, nn. 1, 2, 5,
6, 9, 16, 17.  For buying and selling and the frauds
incident thereto, Paley, <i>Moral Philosophy</i>, bk. iii., p. 1
c. vii.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section V. -- <i>Of Usury</i>.</h2>

1. We must distinguish <i>use value</i> and <i>market
value</i>. The use value of an article of property is the
esteem which the owner has of it from every other
point of view except as a thing to sell. Thus a
man values his overcoat on a journey as a 
protection from cold and rain. A book is valued that
was held in the dying hand of a parent. This is
use value. The market value of an article is the
estimate of society, fixing the rate of exchange
between that and other articles, so much of one for
so much of another, <i>e.g.</i>, between mahogany and
cedar wood, considered as things to sell.<p>

2. Answering to this twofold value is a twofold
exchange, <i>private exchange</i>, which regards use value
and <i>commercial exchange</i>, which is founded on market
value. If I part with my watch to a sailor for
carrying me across an arm of the sea where there is
no public ferry, that is private exchange. If I pay
the ordinary fare where there is a public ferry, that
is commercial exchange.<p>

3. Private exchange begins in the need of at
least one of the contracting parties. It is an act
of charity in the other party to accommodate him
by offering the thing needed. If the offer is made
otherwise than as a gift, and is accepted, he who
avails himself of it is bound in justice to see that the
afforder of the accommodation is compensated for
the loss that he suffers in affording it. Thus far the
recipient is bound in justice, and no further in that
virtue. However wholesome or profitable the thing
be to him that gets it, the supplier cannot charge
for that. but only for the loss that he himself suffers,
or the gain that he foregoes, in handing the thing
over, or the pains that he takes, or the hardship
that he endures, or the risk that he runs, in 
rendering the service desired. If all the labour to be
undergone, or damage incurred, or risk encountered,
by the sailor who goes about by private bargain to
be my ferryman, is fairly met by the remuneration
of a thirty-shilling watch, he has no right to 
stipulate for any more, not though the passage that be
gives me sets me on the way to a throne. The
peculiar advantage that I have in prospect does not
come out of him, but out of myself. He must not
pretend to sell what is not his, what attaches, not
to him, but to me. He can only sell his own loss,
risk, pains and labour. At the same time, if I have
any gentlemanly or generous feeling in me, I shall
be forward to bestow extra remuneration on one
who has rendered me so timely a service: but this
is matter of my gratitude, not of his right and claim
in justice. Gratitude must not be put into the bill.
And this much of private exchange.<p>

4. Commercial exchange is conducted according
to market value. Apart from dire necessity -- and
one in dire necessity is not fit to enter into 
commercial exchanges -- the rule is, that a seller may
always ask the market value of his article, however
much that may be above what the thing cost him,
or the use value which it bears to him.  Thus, if one
finds in his garden a rare Roman coin -- so far as his
tastes go, a paltry bit of metal -- he may sell it for
whatever price numismatists will offer: whereas,
if there were no market for coins, but only one 
individual who doted on such things, the finder could
make no profit out of that individual, the coin
having neither market value with the community,
nor use value in the eyes of the finder.<p>

5. As there is a twofold value, and a twofold
exchange, so a twofold character is impressed on
the great instrument of exchange, money. Money,
in one character, is an instrument of private 
exchange: in its other character, to mercantile men
more familiar, it is an instrument of commercial
exchange. In the one, it represents use value to the
particular owner, more or less to him than it would
be to some other owner: in the other, it represents
market value, the same to all at the same time.<p>

6. Leo X. in the Fifth Council of Lateran,
1515, ruled that -- "usury is properly interpreted to
be the attempt to draw profit and increment, 
without labour, without cost, and without risk, out of
the use of a thing that does not fructify." In 1745
Benedict XIV. wrote in the same sense to the
Bishops of Italy: "That kind of sin which is called
usury, and which has its proper seat and place in
the contract of <i>mutuum</i>, consists in turning that
contract, which of its own nature requires the
amount returned exactly to balance the amount
received, into a ground for demanding a return in
excess of the amount received." <i>Mutuum</i>, be it
observed, is a loan for a definite period, of some
article, the use of which lies in its consumption, as
matches, fuel, food, and, in one respect, money.
We shall prove this to be properly a <i>gratuitous</i>
contract. (s. iv., n. 4, p. 254.)<p>

7. Usury then is no mere taking of exorbitant
interest. There is no question of more or less,
but it is usury to take any interest at all upon the
loan of a piece of property, which<p>

<ul>
(a) is of no use except to be used up, spent, consumed:<br>
(b) is not wanted for the lender's own consumption 
within the period of the loan:<br>
(c) is lent upon security that obviates risk:<br>
(d) is so lent that the lender foregoes no occasion
of lawful gain by lending it.<br>
</ul><p>

8. When all these four conditions are fulfilled,
and yet interest is exacted upon a loan, such interest
is usurious and unjust. And why? Simply by
reason of the principle that we laid down before,
speaking of private exchange (n. 3), a principle that
is thus stated by St. Thomas:<p>

     "If one party is much benefited by the 
commodity which he receives of the other, while the
other, the seller, is not a loser by going without the
article, no extra price must be put on. The reason
is, because the benefit that accrues to one party is
not from the seller, but from the condition of the
buyer.  Now no one ought to sell to another that
which is not his, though he may sell the loss that he
suffers. He, however, who is much benefited by
the commodity he receives of another, may 
spontaneously bestow some extra recompense on the
seller: that is the part of one who has the feelings
of a gentleman." (2a 2ae, q. 77, art. 1, in corp.)<p>

9. St. Thomas speaks of sales, but the principle
applies equally to loans. It is upon loans of money
that interest is commonly taken, and of money-loans
we speak. Clearly, according to the doctrine stated,
the lender can claim the compensation of interest,
if he has to pinch himself in order to lend, or lends
at a notable risk. He is selling his own loss, or
risk, which is loss once removed. But supposing he
has other monies in hand, and the security is good,
and he has enough still left for all domestic needs,
and for all luxuries that he cares to indulge in --
moreover he has nothing absolutely to do with his
money, in the event of his not lending it, but to
hoard it up in his strong box, and wait long months
till he has occasion to use it: in that case, if he
lends it he will be no worse off on the day that he
gets it back, no worse off in the time while it is
away, than if it had never left his coffers. Such is
the contract of <i>mutuum</i>, shorn of all accidental
attendant circumstances, a contract, which "of its
own nature," as Benedict XIV. says, that is, apart
from circumstances, "requires the amount returned
exactly to balance the amount received." Not though
the borrower has profited of the loan to gain 
kingdoms, is any further return in strict justice to be
exacted of him on that precise account.<p>

10. But now an altered case. Suppose land is
purchaseable, and it is proposed to stock a farm
with cattle, and rear them, and convey them to a
large town where there is a brisk demand for meat --
the supposition is not always verified, nor any 
supposition like it, but suppose it verified in some 
one case -- then, though the lender has other monies in
hand for the needs of his household, and the
security is good, yet the money is not so lent as,
that he foregoes no occasion of lawful gain by
lending it. He foregoes the purchase of land and
farm stock, or at least delays it, and delay is loss
where profit is perennial. On that score of gain
forfeited he may exact interest on the money that he
lends, which interest will be no usury. The title of
interest here given is recognized by divines as
<i>lucrum cessans</i>, "interruption of profit." The interest
is taken, so far as it goes upon a lawful title, not
upon the fact of the borrower's profit -- that is
irrelevant -- but upon the profit that the lender
might have made, had he kept the money in hand.<p>

11. This latter case (n. 10) represents that putting
of money out to interest, which is an essential feature
of modern commerce. The former case (n. 9) is the
aspect that money-lending commonly bore in the
Middle Ages. In those days land was hard to buy,
agriculture backward, roads bad, seas unnavigable,
carrying-trade precarious, messages slow, raids and
marauders frequent, population sparse, commerce
confined to a few centres, mines unworked, 
manufactures mostly domestic, capital yet unformed.
Men kept their money in their cellars, or deposited
it for safety in religious houses: whence the stories
of treasure-trove belonging to those days. They
took out the coin as they wanted it to spend on
housekeeping, or on war, or feasting. It was very
hard, next to impossible, to lay out money so as to
make more money by it. Money was in those days
really barren -- a resource for housekeeping, not for
trade -- a medium of private, not of commercial 
exchange -- a representative of use value, not of market
value.  Apart from risk of non-repayment, to take
interest for money that you had no use for but to
hoard, was getting "a breed of barren metal:" it
was taking up what you laid not down: it was
making profit out of your neighbour's need, or your
neighbour's gain, where there was no corresponding
need unsatisfied, or gain forfeited, on your part: it
was that "attempt to draw profit and increment,
without labour, without cost, and without risk, out
of the use of a thing that does not fructify," which
the Fifth Lateran Council defines to be usury.<p>

12. In our time, thanks to steam and electricity,
the increase of population, and continued peace, the
whole world has become one trading community,
representing now more, now less abundant opportunities 
for the investment of money, and the conversion 
of it into other lucrative commodities.  Money
consequently with us is not a mere medium of
private exchange for the purposes of housekeeping:
it is a medium of commercial exchange. It 
represents, not use value, but market value. To be a
thousand pounds out of pocket for a year means an
opportunity of gain irretrievably lost, gain that could
have been made otherwise than by money-lending.
Where this is so, and so far as it is so, the lender
may without violation of justice point to <i>lucrum
cessans</i>, gain lost, and arrange beforehand with the
borrower for being reimbursed with interest.<p>

13. The transition from mediaeval housekeeping,
with its use values and private exchange, to the
mercantile society of modern times, was not made
in a day, nor went on everywhere at the same rate.
It was a growth of ages.  In great cities commerce
rapidly ripened, and was well on towards maturity
five centuries ago.  Then the conditions that render
interest lawful, and mark it off from usury, readily
came to obtain. But those centres were isolated.
Like the centres of ossification, which appear here
and there in cartilage when it is being converted
into bone, they were separated one from another by
large tracts remaining in the primitive condition.
Here you might have a great city, Hamburg or
Genoa, an early type of commercial enterprise, and,
fifty miles inland, society was in its infancy, and the
great city was as part of another world. Hence the
same transaction, as described by the letter of the
law, might mean lawful interest in the city, and
usury out in the country-the two were so disconnected.  
In such a situation the legislator has to
choose between forbidding interest here and allowing
usury there; between restraining speculation and
licensing oppression.  The mediaeval legislator chose
the former alternative. Church and State together
enacted a number of laws to restrain the taking of
interest, laws that, like the clothes of infancy, are
not to be scorned as absurd restrictions, merely
because they are inapplicable now, and would not
fit the modern growth of nations.  At this day the
State has repealed those laws, and the Church has
officially signified that she no longer insists on them.
Still she maintains dogmatically that there is such
a sin as usury, and what it is, as defined in the
Fifth Council of Lateran.<p>
