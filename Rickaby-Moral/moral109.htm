<h1>Chapter IX. Of the Sanction of the Natural Law.</h1>
<hr><p><h2>Section I. -- <i>Of a Twofold Sanction, Natural and Divine.</i></h2>

1. THE sanction of a law is the punishment for
breaking it. The punishment for final, persistent
breach of the natural law is failure to attain the
perfect state and last end of the human soul, which
is happiness. If existence be prolonged under this
failure, it must be in the contrary state of misery,
This failure and misery is at once a <i>natural result</i>
and a <i>divine infliction</i>. It is the natural result of
repeated flagrant acts of moral evil, whereby a man
has made his nature hideous, corrupted and 
overthrown it. (c. VI., s. i., nn. 4, 5, p. 111.) For an end is
gained by taking the means, and lost by neglect of the
means thereto. Now, as we have seen, happiness is
an intellectual act, the perfection of an intellectual or
rational nature (c. II., s. ii., p. 6); and the means to it
are living rationally: for a reasonable being, to do
well and fare well, must live by that reason, which is
the form of his being. (c. VI., s. i., n. 4, p. 111.) 
Whoever therefore goes about contradicting the reason
that is within him (c. V., s. iii., n. 3, P. 74) is not
in the way to attain to happiness. Happiness,
the end of man, the creature of all others the most
complex, is not to be stumbled upon by chance.
You may make two stones lean upright one against
the other by chance, but otherwise than by a
methodical application of means to the end you
could not support the spire of Salisbury Cathedral.<p>

2. Man's is a progressive nature (c. vi., s. i., nn.
2, 3, p. 109), himself being the director of his own 
progress. Other progressive natures may be spoilt by
their requirements being denied, and contrary things
done to them. Man has his requirements. It
depends mainly on himself whether he acts up to,
them or against them. If he acts against them, he
so far spoils himself; and once he is thoroughly
spoilt by his own doing, the final perfection of
humanity is gone from him for ever. It is the
natural result.<p>

3. I have spoken (n. i) of repeated flagrant acts:
not that I would ignore the evil set of the will that
results from one gross and deliberate evil deed (see c.
ix., s. ii., n. 6, p. 168): but because the case is clearer
where the acts have been multiplied. However we
must not omit to observe, that it is not any vice, or
evil habit, that formally unfits a man for his final
happiness, but an actual evil set of the will, coming
of actual sin unrepented of, which set is more
decided, when that uncancelled sin is the last 
of many such, and the outcome of a habit. But
supposing an habitual sinner to have repented, and
his repentance to have been ratified by God, and
that he dies, not actually in sin, but before the habit
of sin has been eradicated (c. v., s. ii., n. i, p. 9)
we may say of him, that his "foot is set in the right
way," that is, his will is actually right, and the
obstacle to happiness is removed. The evil habit in
him is not an actual adhesion of his will to evil, but
a proneness to relapse into that state. It is only
remotely and potentially evil. It is a seed of evil,
which however will not germinate in the good and
blissful surroundings to which the soul has been
transplanted, but remain for ever sterile, or rather,
will speedily decay.<p>

4. If we leave God out of morality, and take
account only of the Philosophical aspect of sin (c. vi.,
s. ii., n. 6, p. 119), we have nothing further to say of
the sanction than this, which has been said: 'Act
against nature, and you will end by ruining your
nature, and fail of your final perfection and 
happiness.' But now God comes in, the giver of the law
of nature; and the failure, already a natural result,
must henceforth be viewed also as a Divine 
chastisement. There is no law without a sanction. There
is no law, the giver of which can allow it to be
broken with impunity. A legislator who dispensed
with all sanction, would rightly be taken by young
and old not to be in earnest in his command. If
then God must give a law to man whom He has
created (c. vi., s. ii., n. 9, p. 120), He must attach a
sanction to that law; and if the law is according to
the exigency of human nature (c. vi., s. ii., n. ii, p. 122),
so will the sanction also be the natural outcome
of that exigency set at naught and that law broken.<p>

5. Our position gains by the consideration, that
the object, in the contemplation of which man's soul
is to be finally and perfectly blessed in the natural
order, is the Creator seen through the veils of His
works. (c. ii., s. iv., p. 21.) This mediate vision of God,
albeit it is to be the work of a future existence, needs
practice and preparation in this life. God will not be
discerned by the man who has not been accustomed
to look for Him. He will not be seen by the swine,
who with head to earth has eaten his fill of sensual
pleasures, and has cared for nothing better. He
will not be seen by the covetous man and the
oppressor, who never identified His image hidden
away under the labour-stained dress of the poor.
He will not be seen by the man, who never
looked up into His face in prayer here below. He
will not be seen by the earth-laden spirit, that cared
nothing at all for God, that hated the mention of
His name, that proclaimed Him, or at least wished
him, not to be at all.<p>

6. It will be said that this argumentation 
supposes the habits of vice, contracted on earth, to
remain in the soul after departure: but there is no
proof of that: nay of some vices -- those that have
more to do with the body, as drunkenness -- the
habits cannot possibly remain, seeing that the
appetite wherein they were resident has perished
with the body. First, as regards the instance cited,
I reply that we may consider drunkenness in two
ways, on the one hand as a turning to the creature,
on the other as a turning away from reason and the
Creator. The craving for liquor cannot remain in
the soul after death exactly as it was before, though
it probably continues in some analogous form, as
a thirst for wild and irregular excitement: but the
loathing and horror of the ways of reason and of
God, engendered by frequent voluntary intoxication,
still continues in the soul. And from this 
observation we draw the general answer, that whereas in
every sin, whether sensual or spiritual, the most
important part is played by the will, and the will is
a spiritual, not an organic faculty, a faculty which is
a main element of the soul whether in or out of the
body, -- therefore the evil bent and inclination of
the will, which sin involves, must remain even in
the departed spirit. Lastly, we may ask: To what
purpose is our free-will given us, if all souls, good
and bad alike, users and abusers of the liberty they
had on earth, enter into their long home all of one
uniform and spotless hue?<p>

7. Thus then it comes to be, by order of nature
and good consequence, that the man who has 
abandoned God, goes without God; and he who has
shunned his last end and final good, arrives not
unto it; and he who would not go, when invited,
to the feast, eats not of the same: and whoso has
withdrawn from God, from him God withdraws.
"A curse he loved, and it shall come upon him;
and he would not have a blessing, and it shall be
far from him. He put on the curse like a garment,
and it has gone in like water into his entrails, and
like oil into his bones, -- like a garment which
covereth him, and like a girdle wherewith he is
girded continually." (Psalm cviii. 18, 19.)<p>

8. Conversely, we might argue the final 
happiness which attaches to the observance of the law of
nature. (c. ii., s. v., p. 26.)<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- <i>Of the Finality of the aforesaid Sanction</i>.</h2>

1. By a <i>final</i>, as distinguished from an <i>eternal</i>
state, is here meant the last state of existence in
a creature, whether that state go on for ever, in
which case it is <i>final</i> and <i>eternal</i>, or whether it
terminate in the cessation of that creature's being,
which is a case of a state <i>final</i>, but not <i>eternal</i>.
Whether the unhappy souls of men, who have
incurred the last sentence of the natural law, shall
exist for eternity, is not a question for philosophy to
decide with certainty. The philosopher rules 
everything <i>a priori</i>, showing what must he, if something
else is. Of the action of God in the world, he can
only foretell that amount which is thus hypothetically
necessary. Some divine action there is, of which
the <i>congruity</i> only, not the <i>necessity</i>, is apparent to
human eyes: there the philosopher can tell with
<i>probability</i>, but not with <i>certainty</i>, what God will
do. Other actions of God are wholly beyond our
estimate of the reasons of them: we call them
simply and entirely free. In that sphere philosophy
has no information to render of her own; she must
wait to hear from revelation what God has done,
or means to do. Philosophers have given <i>reasons of
congruence</i>, as they call them, for the reprobate
sinner not being annihilated, and therefore for his
<i>final</i> punishment being <i>eternal</i>. Those reasons go
to evince the probability of eternal punishment,
a probability which is deepened into certainty by
revelation. We shall not enter into them here, but
shall be content to argue that a term is set to the
career of the transgressor, arrived at which he must
leave hope behind of ever winning his way to 
happiness, or ever leading any other existence than one
of misery.<p>

2. The Previous question has shown that some
punishment must attend upon violation of the
natural law. Suppose a transgressor has suffered
accordingly for a certain time after death, what
shall be done with him in the end? If he does not
continue to suffer as long as he continues to be,
then one of three things: he must either pass into
happiness, or into a new state of probation, or his
very punishment must be a probation wherein if he
believes well, he shall be rewarded with happiness
at last, or if ill, he shall continue in misery until he
amend. All this speculation, be it understood, lies
apart from revelation. If then the sufferer passed
out of this world, substantially and in the main
a good man, it is not unreasonable that, after a
period of expiatory suffering for minor delinquencies,
he should reach that happiness which is the just
reward of his substantial righteousness. But what
of him who closed his career in wickedness exceeding 
great? Mere suffering will never make of him a
good man, or a fit subject for happiness. But the
suffering may be probationary, and he may amend
himself under the trial. Against that hypothesis,
philosophers have brought <i>a priori</i> arguments to show
that the period of probation must end with the 
separation of the soul from the body. But waiving all such
arguments, let us suppose that there might be probation 
after probation even in the world to come. But
some human souls would continue obstinately and
unrepentingly set in wickedness, age after age, and
probation after probation: for the possible malice
of the will is vastly great. What is to become of
such obstinate characters? It seems against the
idea of probation, that periods of trial should
succeed one another in an endless series. It would
be a reasonable rule in a university, that an 
undergraduate who had been plucked twenty-five times,
should become ineligible for his degree. Coming
after so many failures, neither would the degree be
any ornament to him, nor he to the university. A
soul cannot look for seasons without end of possible
grace and pardon to shine upon it. The series of
probations must end somewhere. And then? We
are come round to where we began. When all the
probation is over, the soul is found either in 
conformity with the natural law, which means ultimate 
happiness, or at variance with the law, and becomes
miserable with a misery that shall never terminate,
unless the soul itself ceases to be.<p>

3. It may be asked, how much conformity to the
natural law is requisite and sufficient, to exempt a
person at the end of his trial from a final doom of
misery, or to ensure his lasting happiness? The
question resolves itself into three: -- how do sins
differ in point of gravity? is grave sin ever 
forgiven? is the final award to be given upon the
person's whole life, a balance being struck between
his good and evil deeds, or is it to be simply upon
his moral state at the last moment of his career of
trial?<p>

4. It was a paradox of the Stoics, that all
offences are equal, the treading down of your 
neighbour's cabbage as heinous a crime as sacrilege.
(Horace, <i>Satires</i>, i., 3, 115-119.) But it is obvious
that there is a vast difference, as well objectively
in the matter of the offence, e.g., in the instance
just quoted from Horace, as also subjectively in the
degree of knowledge, advertence, and will, 
wherewith the offender threw himself into the sin. Thus
offences come to be distinguished as grave and light.
the latter being such as with a human master would
involve a reprimand, the former, instant dismissal.
Final misery is not incurred except by grave
offending.<p>

5. The second question, whether grave sin is
ever forgiven, cannot be answered by philosophy.
Of course the sinner may see by the light of reason
his folly and his error, and thereby conceive some
sort of sorrow for it, and retract, and to some
extent withdraw his will from it on natural grounds.
This amendment of sin on its moral and 
philosophical side may deserve and earn pardon at
human hands. But the offence against God remains
to be reckoned for with God. Now God is not
bound to forgive without receiving satisfaction; and
He never can receive due satisfaction from man
for the contempt that a deliberate, grave, and
flagrant violation of the moral law puts upon the
Infinite Majesty of the Lawgiver. The first thing
that revelation has to teach us is whether, and
on what terms, God is ready to pardon grievous
sin.<p>

 6. The balance between deeds good and evil is
not struck merely at the instant of death. It is
being struck continually; and man's final destiny
turns on how that balance stands at the close of his
time of probation. So long as he keeps the substance 
of the moral law, the balance is in his favour.
But one downright wilful and grievous transgression
outweighs with God all his former good deeds. It
is a defiance of the Deity, a greater insult than all
his previous life was a service and homage. It is as
though a loyal regiment had mutinied, or a hitherto
decent and orderly citizen were taken red-handed
in murder. If however God deigns to draw the
offender to repentance, and to pardon him, the
balance is restored. Thus everything finally depends
on man being free from guilt of grievous transgression 
at the instant of death, or at the end of his
period of probation, whenever and wherever that
end may come.<p>

1. xiii., c. xxvi., nn. 183, seq.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section III. -- <i>Of Punishment Retrospective and 
Retributive.</i></h2>

1. The doctrine of the last section might stand
even in the mind of one who held that all 
punishment is probational, and destined for the 
amendment of him who undergoes it, to humble him, to
awaken his sense of guilt, and to make him fear to
transgress again. On this theory of punishment,
the man who in his last probational suffering refuses
to amend, must be let drop out of existence as 
incorrigible, and so clearly his final state is one of
misery. The theory is not inconsistent with <i>final</i>
punishment, but with <i>eternal</i> punishment, unless 
indeed we can suppose a creature for all eternity to
refuse, and that under stress of torment, a standing,
invitation to repentance. It is however a peculiar
theory, and opposite to the common tradition of
mankind, which has ever been to put gross offenders
to death, not as incorrigible, not simply as refuse to
be got rid of, but that their fate may be a <i>deterrent</i>
to others. Punishment, in this view, is <i>medicinal</i>
to the individual, and <i>deterrent</i> to the community.
Eternal punishment has been defended on the score
of its <i>deterrent</i> force. Both these functions of
punishment, the <i>medicinal</i> and the <i>deterrent</i> function,
are prospective. But there is asserted a third 
function, which is retrospective: punishment is said to
be <i>retributive</i>. It is on this ground that the 
justification of eternal punishment mainly rests. We are
however here concerned, not with that eternity, but
in an endeavour to give a full and adequate view of
punishment in all its functions.<p>

2. If punishment is never <i>retributive</i>, the human
race in all countries and ages has been the sport of
a strange illusion. Everyone knows what <i>vengeance</i>
means. It is a desire to punish some one, or to see
him punished, not prospectively and with an eye to
the future, for his improvement, or as a warning to
others, but retrospectively and looking to the past,
that he may suffer for what he has done. Is then
the idea of vengeance nothing but an unclean
phantom? Is there no such thing as vengeance to
a right-minded man? Then is there an evil element,
an element <i>essentially</i> and <i>positively</i> evil, in human
nature. No one will deny that the idea, and to
some extent the desire, of vengeance, of retaliation,
of retrospective infliction of suffering in retribution
for evil done, of what we learn to call in the nursery
<i>tit for tat</i>, is natural to mankind. It is found in all
men. We all respond to the sentiment:<p>

<ul><ul>
 Mighty Fates, by Heaven's decree accomplish,<br>
 According as right passes from this side to that.<br>
 For hateful speech let speech of hate be paid back:<br>
 justice exacting her due cries this aloud:<br>
 For murderous blow dealt let the murderer pay<br>
 By stroke of murder felt.<br>
 Do and it shall be done unto thee:<br>
 Old is this saying and old and old again.
</ul></ul><p>

[AEschylus, <i>Choephori</i>, 3i6, seq. These lines embody the idea on
which the dramas of the Shakespeare of Greece are principally
founded. But when was a work of the highest art based upon an
idea unsound, irrational and vicious?]<p>

Nor must we be led away by Mill (<i>Utilitarianism</i>,
c. v.) into confounding retaliation, or vengeance,
with self-defence. Self-defence is a natural idea
also, but not the same as retaliation. We defend
ourselves against a mad dog, we do not retaliate on
him. Hence we must not argue that, because 
self-defence is prospective, therefore so is vengeance.<p>

 3. A thing is essentially evil, when there is no
possible use of it which is not an abuse. Not far
different is the conception of a thing positively evil,
evil, that is, not by reason of any deficiency, or by
what it is not, but evil by what it is in itself. Such an
essential, positive evil in human nature would 
vengeance be, a natural thing for which there was no natural
use, unless punishment may in some measure be
retributive. We cannot admit such a flaw in nature.
All healthy philosophy goes on the principle, that
what is natural is so far forth good. Otherwise
we lapse into Manicheism, pessimism, scepticism,
abysses beyond the reach of argument. Vengeance
undoubtedly prompts to many crimes, but so does
the passion of love. Both are natural impulses.
It would scarcely be an exaggeration to set down
one third of human transgressions to love, and
another third to revenge: yet it is the abuse in each
case, not the use, that leads to sin. If the 
matrimonial union were wicked and detestable, as the
Manicheans taught, then would the passion of love
be an abomination connatural to man. Such another
enormity would be the affection of vengeance, if
punishment could never rightly be retributive.<p>

 4. Aristotle, <i>Rhetoric</i>, I., x., 17, distinguishes two
functions of punishment thus: "Chastisement is
for the benefit of him that suffers it, but vengeance
is for him that wreaks it, that he may have 
satisfaction." Add to this the warning given to the 
commonwealth by the example that is made of the
offender, and we have the three functions of 
punishment, <i>medicinal, deterrent</i>, and <i>retributive</i>. As it is
<i>medicinal</i>, it serves the <i>offender</i>: as it is <i>deterrent</i>, 
it serves the <i>commonwealth</i>: as it is <i>retributive</i>, it serves
the <i>offended party</i>, being a reparation offered to him.
Now, who is the offended party in any evil deed?
So far as it is a sin against Justice, an infringement
of any man's right, he is the offended party. He is
offended, however, not simply and precisely by your
violation of the moral law, but by your having, in
violation of that law, taken away something that
belonged to him. Consequently, when you make
restitution and give him back what you took away,
with compensation for the temporal deprival of it,
he is satisfied, and the offence against him is 
repaired. If you have maliciously burnt his house
down, you bring him the price of the house and
furniture together with further payment for the
fright and for the inconvenience of being, for the
present, houseless. You may do all that, and yet
the moral guilt of the conflagration may remain
upon your soul. But that is no affair of his: he is
not the custodian of the moral law: he is not
offended by your sin, formally viewed as sin: nor has
he any function of punishing you, taking vengeance
upon you, or exacting from you retribution for that.
But what if his wife and children have perished,
and you meant them so to perish, in the fire? Your
debt of restitution still lies in the matter which you
took away. Of course it is a debt that cannot be
paid. You cannot give back his "pretty chickens
and their dam" whole and alive again. Still your
inability to pay one debt does not make you liable
to that creditor for another debt, which is part of a
wholly different account. He is not offended by,
nor are you answerable to him for, your <i>sin</i> in this
case any more than in the former.<p>

5. We may do an <i>injury</i> to an individual, commit
a <i>crime</i> against the State, and <i>sin</i> against God. The
injury to the individual is repaired by restitution,
not by punishment, and therefore not by vengeance,
which is a function of punishment. There is no
such thing as vengeance for a private wrong, and.
therefore we have the precept to forgive our enemies,
and not to avenge ourselves, in which phrase the
emphasis falls on the word <i>ourselves</i>. The clear
idea and strong desire of vengeance, which nature
affords, shows that there is such a thing as 
vengeance to be taken by some one: it does not warrant
every form of vengeance, or allow it to be taken by
each man for himself. It consecrates the principle
of retribution, not every application of the principle.
It is a point of <i>synderesis</i>, not of particular conduct.
The reader should recall what was said of the 
vengeance of Hannibal at Himera. (c. viii., s. ii., p. 144).<p>

6. It belongs to the State to punish <i>Political sin</i>,
or crime and to God to punish <i>theological sin</i>, which
is sin properly so called, a breach of the Eternal
Law. The man who has burnt his neighbour's
house down, though he has compensated the 
individual owner, may yet be punished by the State.
The owner, acting in his, capacity as citizens even
when he has been compensated as an individual,
may still hand him over to the State for punishment.
The arson was a violation, not only of <i>commutative</i>
but of <i>legal</i> justice (c. v., s. ix., nn, 3, 6, pp. 103, 106), a
disturbance of the public peace and social order, an
outrage upon the majesty of the law. For this he may
be punished by the State, which is the guardian of all
these things, and which has jurisdiction over him
to make laws for him, and to enforce their sanction
against him. Civil punishment, besides being 
deterrent, is retributive for the breach of social order. It
is the vengeance of the commonwealth upon the
disturber of tile public peace. Whether the State can
punish on pure grounds of retribution, away from all
hope or need of deterring possible imitators of the
crime, is a question irrelevant to our present enquiry.
Probably a negative answer should be returned.<p>

7. We come now to the punishment of sin by
God, the Living Reasonableness, the Head of the
Commonwealth of Creation, the Legislator of the
Eternal Law, the Fountain of all jurisdiction, Him
in whose hands rests the plenitude of the power to
punish. An evil deed may be no wrong to any 
individual man, no crime against the State, but it must
ever be an offence against God. It is a departure
from the order of man's progress as a reasonable
being (c. v., s. iii., n. 3, p, 74: c. vi., s. i., nn. 1-5,
p. 109), which is founded on the nature of God
Himself (c. vi., s. i., n. 7, p. 113), of which order
God is the official guardian (c. vi., s. ii., nn. 8-10,
p. 119), and which is enjoined by God's Eternal
Law. (c. vii., n. 3, p. 129.) This law extends to all
creation, rational and irrational, animate and 
inanimate. It bids every creature work according to his
or its own nature and circumstances. Given to 
irrational beings, the law is simply irresistible and
unfailing: such are the physical laws of nature, so
many various emanations of the one Eternal Law.
Given to rational creatures, the law may be resisted
and broken: sin is the one thing in the universe that
does break it. (c. vii., nn. 5-7, p. 130.) A man may act
in disregard of the Eternal Law on one or other of
its physical sides, and so much the worse for him,
though he has not broken the law, but merely ignored
its operation, as when one eats what is unwholesome.
Much more shall he suffer for having broken the
law, in the only possible way that it can be
broken, by sin. This peculiar violation draws after
it a peculiar consequence of suffering, penal and
retributive. If a man gets typhoid fever in his house,
we sometimes say it is a <i>punishment</i> on him for
neglecting his drains, even when the neglect was a
mere piece of ignorance or inadvertence. It is an
evil consequence certainly, -- the law, which he
thought not of, working itself out in the form of
disease. But it is not properly punishment: no
natural law has been really broken: there has been
no guilt, and the suffering is not retributive and
compensatory. It does not go to restore the balance
of the neglect. It is a lamentable consequence, not
a repayment. As, when man wrongs his fellow-man,
he makes with him an <i>involuntary contract</i> (c. v., s. ix.,
n. 6, p. 106), to restore what he takes away: so in
sinning against God, man makes another involuntary
contract, to pay back in suffering against his will
what he unduly takes in doing his own will against
the will of the Legislator. As St. Augustine says of
Judas (Serm. 125, n. 5): "He did what he liked,
but he suffered what he liked not. In his 
doing what he liked, his sin is found: in his 
suffering what he liked not, God's ordinance is praised."
Thus it is impossible for the Eternal Law, which
bears down all so irresistibly in irrational nature,
finally to fail of its effect even upon the most
headstrong and contumacious of rational creatures;
but, as St. Thomas says (1a 2ae, q. 93, art. 6,
in corp.), "The defect of doing is made up by
suffering, inasmuch as they suffer what the Eternal
Law prescribes for them to the extent to which they
fail to do what accords with the Eternal Law."
And St. Anselm (<i>Cur Deus homo</i>, nn. 14, 15): "God
cannot possibly lose His honour: for either the
sinner spontaneously pays what he owes, or God
exacts it of him against his will. Thus if a man
chooses to fly from under the will of God 
commanding, he falls under the same will punishing."
Punishment is called by Hegel, "the other half of
sin." Lastly, they are God's own spoken words
