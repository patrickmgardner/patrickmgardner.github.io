<h1>Chapter III. Of Speaking the Truth.</h1>

<H2>Section I. -- <i>Of the Definition of a Lie</i>.</h2>

1. "LET none doubt," says St. Augustine, "that he
lies, who utters what is false for the purpose of
deceiving. Wherefore the utterance of what is false
with a will to deceive is unquestionably a lie." The
only question is, whether this definition does not
contain more than is necessary to the thing defined.  
The objective falseness of what is said makes a <i>material</i> 
falsehood: the will to utter what is false makes
a <i>formal</i> falsehood (<i>Ethics</i>, c. iii., s. ii., n. 7, p. 33):
the will to create a false impression regards, not the
falsehood itself, but the effect to follow from it. If
a person says what is not true, but what he takes to
be the truth, he tells indeed a material lie, but at
the same time he puts forth no <i>human act</i> (<i>Ethics</i>,
c. i., n. 2, p. 1) of lying.  If on the other hand he
says what he believes to be false, though it turns out
true, he tells a formal lie, though not a material
one, and moreover, he does a <i>human act</i> of lying.
But <i>human acts</i> are the subject-matter of morality.
The moralist therefore is content to define the
<i>formal lie</i>: the <i>material</i> aspect of the lie is irrelevant
to his enquiry, A formal lie is saying what one
believes not to be true, or promising what one
intends not to perform: briefly, it is <i>speaking against
one's mind</i>.<p>

2. We shall show presently that to speak against
one's mind is intrinsically, necessarily, and always
evil. But when a thing is thus evil in itself, there is
no need to bring into the definition of the act, from
a moral point of view, the intention with which it
is done. There is no use in prying into ends, when
the means taken is an unlawful means for any end.
If a person blasphemes, we do not ask why he
blasphemes: the intention is not part of the blasphemy: 
the utterance is a sin by itself But if a
person strikes, we ask why he strikes, to heal or to
slay, in self-defence or in revenge. So, if speaking
against one's mind is a thing indifferent and colourless 
in point of morality, and all depends on the
intention with which we do it, so that we may
speak against our minds to put another off, but not
to deceive him, then certainly the intention to
deceive must be imported into the definition of
lying. But if, as we shall prove presently, the act
of so speaking is by no means indifferent and colourless, 
but is fraught with an inordinateness all its
own, then the intention may be left out of the question, 
the act is to be characterised on its own
merits, and speech against one's mind is the definition
of a lie.<p>

3. Then, some one will say, it would be a lie for
a prisoner in solitary confinement to break the
silence of his cell with the exclamation, Queen Anne
is not dead.  The answer is simple: it takes two to
make a speech.  A man does not properly speak to
himself, nor quarrel with himself, nor deal justly by
himself.  Not that it would be a lie to deny the
death of Queen Anne even in public: for speech is
an outward affirmation, the appearance of a serious
will to apply predicate to subject: but in this case
there is no appearance of a serious will: on the
contrary, from the manifest absurdity of the 
assertion, it is plain that you are joking and do not mean
to affirm anything. This perhaps is as far as we
can go in permission of what are called lies in jest.<p>

<i>Readings</i>. -- St Thos., 2a 2ae, q. 110, art. 1.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section II. -- <i>Of the Evil of Lying.</i></h2>

I. Human society cannot go on, if men are to
be allowed indiscriminately to lie to one another.
Thucydides (iii., 83) gives as the reason of the 
extravagant length to which faction ran in Greece in
his time: "For there was no power to reconcile the
parties, no plighted word reliable, no oath held in
awe." Even in trifles no one likes to be lied to, and
we are not to do to our neighbour what we would
not have done to ourselves. The laws of good
fellowship require that we should "put away lying,
and speak the truth ever man with his neighbour:
for we are members one of another." (Ephesians
iv. 25.) This at least in ordinary circumstances.
The same good fellowship requires that in ordinary
circumstances we should respect the lives and
property of our fellow-men.<p>

2. But it is lawful to take life in pursuance of
the just judgment of authority: it is lawful to seize
upon property in self-preservation. These exceptions 
stand very harmoniously with the well-being
of society, or rather are required by it, as we shall
see later on. The law against lying, so far as it is
founded on the general prejudice done to society by
the shock of social confidence, and on the particular
annoyance of the party lied to, may seem to
admit of similar exceptions. Whoever has no
reasonable objection to having life and property
taken from him in certain contingencies, can he
reasonably complain of any hurt or inconvenience
that he may suffer from a lie being told him at
times?<p>

3. I put forward this difficulty, not as though it
were without its answer in the principle of General
Consequences: still it is a difficulty. Besides, if the
whole harm of lying is in the unpleasant effect
wrought upon the deceived bearer, and the scandal
and bad consequences to society at large, it is a
long way to go round to show that lying is 
impossible to God. He in whose dominion are all the
rights and claims of man, is not to be restrained by
the mere reluctance of His creatures to be deceived,
or by the general bad effects of a lie upon the edifice
of human credit.  As Alaster He might impose this
annoyance upon the individual, these bad consequences 
upon society: or by His Providence He
might prevent their occurring, whenever He willed
in His utterances to swerve from the truth.  The
only help for the argument for the Divine veracity
on these grounds, is to urge with Plato that none of
the motives which lead men to lie can ever find
place in the mind of God: that a lie is a subterfuge, 
an economy, a device resorted to under stress
of circumstances, such as can never serve the turn
of the Supreme Being. But though God be inaccessible 
to human reasons for departing from the
truth, may He not have higher reasons, mysterious,
and unsearchable, for such a deviation? It is long
arguing out this point. Better bring the discussion
sharp round with the question: Is there not some
element in the Divine Nature itself, which makes it
impossible for God to speak false?<p>

4. Undoubtedly there is such an element, deep
down, even at the root of the sanctity of God. God
is holy in that, being by essence the fulness of all
being and all goodness, He is ever true to Himself
in every act of His understanding, of His will, and
of His power.  By His understanding He abidingly
covers, grasps, and comprehends His whole Being.
With His will He loves Himself supremely. His
power is exercised entirely for His glory -- entirely,
but not exclusively, for God's last and best external
glory is in the consummated happiness of His
creatures. Whatever God makes, He makes in His
own likeness, more or less so according to the degree
of being which He imparts to the creature. And as
whatever God does is like Him, and whatever God
makes is like Him, so whatever God says is like
Him: His spoken word answers to His inward
word and thought. It holds of God as of every
being who has a thought to think and a word to
utter
<ul><ul>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
              To thine own self be true,<br>
And it must follow as the night the day,<br>
Thou canst not then be false to any man.<br>
</ul></ul><p>

5. God's sanctity is in His being true to Himself.
His veracity is part of His sanctity. He cannot in
His speech, or revelation of Himself, contradict
what He really has in His mind, without ceasing to
be holy and being no longer God. But the sanctity
of intellectual creatures must be, like their every
other pure perfection, modelled on the corresponding
perfection of their Maker. Holiness must mean
truthfulness in man, for it means truthfulness in
God. God's words cannot be at variance with His
thought, for God is essential holiness. Nor can
man speak otherwise than as he thinks without
marring the attribute of holiness in himself, that is,
without doing wrong.<p>

6. To speak against one's mind is an act falling
upon undue matter. Words are naturally signs of
thoughts. Not that the words of any given language,
as English or German, have any natural connection
with the thoughts that they express; but it is natural
to men, natural to every intellectual being, to have
some mode of expressing his thoughts by outward
signs; and once a sign is recognized as the sign of
a certain thought, so long as the convention remains
unrepealed, whoever uses that sign, not having in
his mind at the time the thought which that sign
signifies, but the contradictory to it, is doing violence
to the natural bond between sign and thing signified,
by putting forward the former where the latter is 
not behind it. And since the due and proper matter
for the sign to be put upon is the presence in the 
mind of the thought signified, to make that sign
where the opposite thought is present \, is, as St.
Thomas says, an act falling upon undue matter.
The peculiar spiritual and moral inviolability of the
connection between word and thought, appears from
the consideration which we have urged of the archetype
holiness of God.  This then is the real, intrinsic,
primary, and inseparable reason, why lying,
or speech in contradiction with the though of the
speaker, is everywhere and always wrong.<p>

7. Grotius (<i>De Jure Belli et Pacis</i>, l. iii., c. i., nn. 11,
seq.) argues a lie to be wrong solely inasmuch as it
is "in conflict with the existing and abiding right of
the person spoken to."  If <i>right</i> here means something
binding in <i>commutative justice</i> (<i>Ethics</i>, c. v., s. ix.,
n. 6, p. 106), we deny that any such right is violated by
what is called a <i>simple</i> lie, that is, an untruth not in
the  matter of religion, and not affecting the character,
property, or personal well-being of our neighbour.
For is a simple lie is a violation of commutative
justice, it carries the obligation of restitution (<i>Ethics</i>,
c. v., s. ix., n. 6, p. 107); that is, we are bound to tell the
truth afterwards to the person that we have lied to,
even in a matter of no practical consequence, -- quite
a new burden on the consciences of men.  Again, if
the bar to lying were the hearer's right, whoever
had dominion over another's right might lie to him'
the parent might lie to the child, the State to the
citizens and God to man, a doctrine which, away
from its application to God, Grotius accepts.  Lastly
since <i>volenti non fit injuria</i>, the presumed willingness
of the listener would license all manner of officious
and jocose lies, as the authority of the speaker
would sanction official fabrications.  Thus, what
with official, and what with officious speeches, it
would be very hard to believe anybody.<p>

8. By our rejection of Grotius' theory we are
enabled to answer Milton's question: "If all killing
be not murder, nor all taking from another, stealing
why must all untruths be lies?" Because, we say,
killing and taking away of goods deal with rights
which are not absolute and unlimited, but become
in certain situations void; whereas an untruth turns,
not on another's right, but on the exigency of the
speaker's own rational nature calling for the concord
of the word signifying with the thought signified,
and this exigency never varies. <i>Untruth</i> and <i>falsehood</i>
are but polite names for a <i>lie</i>.<p>

<hr><p><h2>Section III. -- <i>Of the keeping of Secrets without Lying</i>.</h2>

1. There are <i>natural</i> secrets, secrets of <i>promise</i>,
and secrets of <i>trust</i>.  A <i>natural</i> secret is all a man's
own private history, which he would not have made
public, as also all that he discovers by his own
observation of the similar private history of his
neighbours. If a man finds out something about
his neighbour, and, after he has found it out for
himself, the neighbour gets him to promise not to
publish it, that is a secret of <i>promise</i>. Lastly, if one
man comes to another, as to a lawyer, or a surgeon,
for professional advice, or simply to a friend for
moral counsel, and in order thereto imparts to him
some of his natural secrets, those secrets, as they
are received and held by the person consulted, are
called secrets of <i>trust</i>. This latter kind of secret is
privileged above the other two.  A natural secret,
and also a secret of promise, must be delivered up
on the demand of an authority competent to inquire
in the department where the secret lies. But a
secret of trust is to be given up to no inquirer, but
to be kept against all who endeavour to come by it,
except where the matter bodes mischief and wrong
to a third party, or to the community, and where at
the same time the owner of the secret cannot be
persuaded to desist from the wrong. This proviso
does not hold for the seal of confession, which is 
absolutely inviolable.<p>

2. The main art of keeping a secret is, not to
talk about it. If a man is asked an awkward question, 
and sees no alternative but to let out or lie, it
is usually his own fault for having introduced the
subject, or encouraged the questioner up to that
point.  A wise man lets drop in time topics which
he is unwilling to have pressed. But there are
unconscionable people who will not be put off, and
who, either out of malice or out of stupidity, ply you
with questions against all rules of good breeding.
This direct assault may sometimes be retaliated,
and a rude question met by a curt answer.  But
such a reply is not always prudent or charitable,
and would not unfrequently convey the very information 
required. Silence would serve no better, for
silence gives consent, and is eloquent at times.  
There is nothing left for it in such cases but to lock
your secret up, as it were, in a separate compartment
of your breast, and answer according to the 
remainder of your information, which is not secret,
private, and confidential. This looks very much
like lying, but it is not lying, it is speaking the truth
under a <i>broad mental reservation</i>.<p>

3. <i>Mental reservation</i> is an act of the mind,
limiting the spoken phrase so that it may not bear
the full sense which at first hearing it seems to bear.
The reservation, or limitation of the spoken sense,
is said to be <i>broad</i> or <i>pure</i>, according as it is, or is
not, indicated externally.  A <i>pure mental reservation</i>,
where the speaker uses words in a limited meaning,
without giving any outward clue to the limitation,
is in nothing different from a lie, and is wrong as a
lie is always wrong. A good instance is Archbishop
Cranmer's oath of fealty to the Pope, he having
previously protested -- of course out of hearing of
the Pope or the Pope's representative -- that he
meant that oath in no way to preclude him from
labouring at the reformation of the Church in
England, that is, doing all the evil work which Henry
VIII. had marked out for him in the teeth of the
Roman Bishop. [Strype's <i>Cranmer</i>, I., pp 27, 
28; <i>ib.</i>, ii., Appendices 5, 6; ed. Oxon., 
1812.] Even broad mental reservation is
permissible only as a last resource, when no other
means are available for the preservation of some
secret which one has a duty to others, or grave
reason of one's own, to keep.<p>

4. The point to make out is that no lie is told.
To speak under a reservation is a lie, if it is speech
against the mind of the speaker. But how can it
be aught else than speech against the mind, when
the heart thinks yea, and the tongue says nay? We
answer that, in the case contemplated, the thought
of the heart is, <i>secrets apart, nay</i>; and though the
word on the lips is <i>nay</i> simply, yet we must not take
that word as the whole locution, but as a mere text,
to which the situation of the speaker and the matter
spoken of form a commentary, legible to any observant 
eye.  The word is an annotated text; <i>nay</i> in the
body of the page, with <i>secrets apart</i> inscribed in the
margin.  The adequate utterance is the whole page,
text and gloss together; that speech answers to the
thought in the speaker's mind; therefore it is no lie.<p>

5. The essential requisite is that the gloss, <i>secrets
apart</i>, be not written in the speaker's private mind,
but be outwardly and publicly manifest in the matter
spoken of, which must be one that clearly admits of
secrets, and in the circumstances of the speaker,
who is driven into a corner, and obliged to answer
something, and yet cannot by any prudent man be
expected to answer out of the fulness of all the
knowledge that he may possibly possess.<p>

6. Nor let it be said that all confidence in the
replies given to our questions is hereby destroyed.
For most questions are in matters that do not admit
of a secret. There the qualification, secrets apart,
which may be said to attach to all answers, has no
value and meaning: it is mathematically equal to
zero; and we may take the answer in full assurance
just as it reaches our ear.  Again, when a person
volunteers a statement unasked, he cannot be 
supposed to be reserving secrets.  But when delicate
subjects are touched on, and inquiry is pushed to
extremity by an unauthorized questioner, <i>secrets
apart</i> is the handwriting on the wall.<p>

7. But why is not this qualification spoken out
with the tongue? Sometimes it safely may be, and
then it should be so added. But, as the addition is
unusual, our taking the trouble to express it would
often certify to the inquirer that his suspicions were
correct, though we ought not to tell him so. Our
aim then must be to give such an oral answer as
we should return, were the suspicion quite unfounded.  
Our questioner, if he is a prudent man, will piece
out our phrase with the addition, <i>secrets apart</i>; and
he will understand that he can get nothing out of
us either way, which is exactly what we wish him to
understand. His unauthorized interrogatory has
been met by speech that amounts to silence, arguing
indeed our prudence, but leaving him as wise as
before on the forbidden topic. If he is a thoughtless
man, he is deceived, not by any intention or election
of ours, but indirectly so far as we are concerned,
an incidental deception which he has brought on
himself.<p>

8. This then is a convention that obtains, not
of positive institution, but dictated by nature herself,
that on a matter which admits of being secret, any
answer elicited under stress of necessity must be
so construed, as that any grave secret that may be
touched, not being morally in the power of the
respondent to reveal, shall be taken to remain
reserved.<p>

9. We may therefore sometimes avoid seeming
to know what we know, or to be what we are. But
we may never of our own proper motion step forward 
and court observation as being what we are
not, or knowing what is against or beyond our
knowledge. We may dissemble occasionally, but
not simulate. The dissembler of a secret wishes
for obscurity and silence: he wants to have the
eyes of men turned away from him and their
curiosity unroused. Whatever he says or does is
to divest the idea of there being anything particularly
interesting about him. But he who simulates -- call
him pretender, impostor, or quack -- is nothing, if
not taken notice of. The public gaze is his sun.
shine: obscurity gives him a deadly chill. His
ambition is to appear out of the ordinary, being
really quite within common lines: the dissembler
is in some respect beyond the ordinary, but wishes
not to show himself otherwise than as an ordinary
mortal with ordinary knowledge. The pretender is
on the offensive, challenging attention: the dissembler 
is on his defence against notice. "Simulation," 
says Bolingbroke, "is a stiletto, not only
an offensive but an unlawful weapon, and the use
of it may be rarely, very rarely, excused, but never
justified. Dissimulation is a shield, as secrecy is
armour: and it is no more possible to preserve
secrecy in the administration of public affairs without 
dissimulation than it is to succeed in it without
secrecy." (<i>Idea of a Patriot King</i>.)<p>
