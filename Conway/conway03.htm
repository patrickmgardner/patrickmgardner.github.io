CHAPTER VI.<p>

HIS WRITINGS: SECOND PERIOD.<p>

WHILE the Angelic Doctor was reading his Office
for Corpus Christi before Urban IV, the Pontiff's
eyes were suffused with tears: never was guerdon
better earned, so, retiring into his oratory, after a
little while he came forth bearing the large silver
dove containing the sacred species, and gave it as
a memento. Then he charged St. Thomas to write
a luminous commentary on the Four Gospels, compiled 
exclusively from the writings of the Fathers.
Under the title of "Catena Aurea," or "Golden
Chain," he composed the fullest commentary ever
drawn from Patristic sources, culled impartially from 
Eastern and Western Fathers, and for the most
part written from memory. St. Matthew's Gospel,
finished in 2264, was dedicated to the Pope, who
died soon after; the other three Gospels followed,
but St. John's was dedicated to his fellow religious,
Cardinal d'Annibaldi. Directly Pope Clement IV
assumed the tiara in February, 2265, he summoned
Thomas to Rome. If love of truth made our saint
<!--
HIS WRITINGS: SECOND PERIOD. 63
-->
always. to seek the quiet of retirement, the call of
obedience found him ready for further work. He
now put forth another argumentative treatise, begun
long before in Paris, in which Arabian pantheism
yielded before the power of the syllogism; its title
is: "On the Unity of the Intellect, against the
Averroists". Averroes, the cultured Arabian physician, 
while outwardly professing to be a Christian,
was an atheist at heart. Christianity he called an
impossible religion, Judaism one for children,
Mohammedanism one fit for hogs. The basis of his
errors was this, that all men have but the one
intellect, and consequently but one soul: 
consequently, there is no personal morality. "Peter
is saved: I am one intellect and soul with Peter;
so I shall be saved." Presumably the deduction
from unity of intellect with Judas was forgotten.
From the appearance of St. Thomas's work, the
philosophy of Averroes was consigned to the 
antiquities of the buried past.<p>

Meanwhile the Father-General, Blessed John de
Vercelli, and his brethren, were conscious of the
loss to the Order in being so long deprived of the
holy doctor's services: so now, by agreement with
Pope Clement, he returned to the cloister-school
of Santa Sabina on the Aventine. The General
Chapter held at Montpellier in 2265 assigned him
to Rome, to resume teaching. "We assign Friar
Thomas of Aquino to Rome, for the remission of
his sins, there to take over the direction of studies.
Should any students be found wanting in application,
<!--
64 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
we empower him to send them back to their own
convents." He now drew up the scheme of his
most memorable work, the triumph of his life, the
great "Summa Theologica," which he was not
destined to complete even after nine years of labour.
The very daring of the scheme, comprising the
whole range of dogmatic and moral theology, fills
the world with astonishment, while its intricacy of
argument can be likened only to some gorgeous
tapestry woven by the genius of thought. Let us
hear his introductory prologue.<p>

"Since the teacher of Catholic truth ought to
instruct not merely the advanced, but it falls to him
likewise to teach beginners, according to the saying
of the Apostle in 1 Corinthians III. 1 : <i>'As unto
little ones in Christ, I gave you milk to drink, and
not meat'</i>; the purpose of our intent in this work
is to treat of the matters of the Christian religion
in such a way as to adapt them to the instruction
of beginners.<p>

"Now we have observed that novices in such learning 
are very much hindered by the writings of some
individuals; partly from the multiplying of useless
questions, articles, and arguments; partly again because 
the themes to be learnt are not dealt with in
their proper order, but just as the explanation of
text-books called for, or as occasion for discussion
arose; and, finally, in part because the constant
repetition of the same matter begot weariness and
confusion in the minds of the listeners.<p>

"Endeavouring then to avoid these and similar
<!--
HIS WRITINGS: SECOND PERIOD. 65
-->
drawbacks, and confiding in the Divine assistance,
we shall endeavour to traverse briefly and clearly all
the matters of sacred doctrine, according as the
matter in hand shall permit,"<p>

Drawing exhaustively upon theological founts, he
brings in Philosophy simply as a handmaid, to confirm 
from Reason the teachings of Revelation. This
<i>Sum of Theology</i> is the most perfect body of truth,
the fullest exposition of theological lore ever given
to the Church. When one calls to mind the frequent
interruptions from daily lectures, frequent preaching
and journeys afoot, the marvel is that it ever neared
completion. The <i>First Part</i> treats of God and
Creation. In rigid sequel the treatises deal with
God's Existence, Unity, Attributes, and Trinity.
Creation comprises God's creative action, the 
Hexameron or work of the six days, the Angels, and
lastly Man. All this is set forth in 119 Questions,
or divisions, subdivided into 584 articles, making
one great folio. The <i>Second Part</i> is subdivided
into two divisions known as the <i>First of the Second</i>
and <i>Second of the Second</i>, yielding two more folios.
The former deals with the End of man, which is the
Vision of God; with Morality, Passions, Sin, Theological 
and Moral Virtues, Gifts of the Spirit, Law,
and Grace. In comprises 114 Questions, containing
619 articles. Whereas this <i>Part</i> deals with the subject 
matter under common consideration, the <i>Second
of the Second</i> goes over the same ground in detail,
under particular consideration, ending with the
states of bishops and religious. This occupies 289
<!--
66 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
Questions, with 916 articles. The <i>Third Part</i>
treats of Redemption through Christ: the chief
treatises are the Incarnation, the Life of Christ, thus
forming a perfect Christology; the Sacraments as
sources of grace applying the fruits of Redemption,
then in detail -- Baptism, Confirmation, Eucharist,
and Penance. When mid-way through the treatise
on Penance, the pen was laid down to be resumed
no more. With his own hand he wrote ninety
Questions, containing 539 articles. The rest of the
Part is all his, but compiled by another hand: it is
drawn from his Commentary on the Fourth Book
of the Sentences: this supplement contains 
ninety-nine more Questions distributed into 442 
articles; making the <i>Third Part</i> complete under 289 
Questions, with 981 articles. This vast arsenal of 
Catholic Doctrine has altogether 497 Questions, 
subdivided into 2481 articles. The <i>First Part</i>, written
in Rome, occupied him during two years; the
<i>Second Part</i> was written in Bologna and Paris, the
fruit of five years' toil; the <i>Third Part</i> was compiled
in Naples. Small wonder then that the words of a
Pope are inserted as an antiphon in his festival
office: --<p>

<blockquote>
As a river of limpid knowledge<br>
He irrigates the entire Holy Church.
</blockquote><p>

Ten years had elapsed since the attack was made
on the Mendicant Orders by William de Saint
Amour, who was forced to retire apparently a broken
man. Once more he returned to the fray with a
<!--
HIS WRITINGS: SECOND PERIOD. 67
-->
more plausible work, which the Pope handed over
to the Master General for St. Thomas to confute.
In 1268 appeared the Apology for the Religious
Orders, entitled "Against those who would withdraw
others from entering the Religious State". He wrote
this Apology for a purpose, and he attained it: the
purpose was to combat prejudice against youth
seeking the state of perfection. Presently he added
another treatise, "On the perfection of the Spiritual
Life," to show wherein Christian perfection lies
essentially, and by what means it may be attained.<p>

All perfection consists essentially in Divine Love.
<i>"God is Charity,"</i> hence, since human perfection
comes of progressive likeness to God, it follows
that it comes of the infusion and exercise of Charity.
It is the one abiding gift which never falls away.
The Moral Virtues give fitness for the life of 
blessedness in heaven: Faith and Hope pass into Vision
and Embrace, but Charity alone endures. The
charity of creatures comprises four degrees, as the
ascending scale to the Holiest Himself. There is
the love of the Angels, whose choirs attain their
zenith in the blessed Seraphim. The sons of light
are the sons of fire. "Thou makest thine Angels
spirits, and thy ministers a flame of fire" (Psalm
cxxi. 4). Next in order comes the love of the Blessed,
ever actually engrossed in the thought of God, who
can never turn their faces away: with them their
love is their life, and the outcome of their degree
of charity when on earth. But, as St. Thomas
teaches, love such as this is beyond man's earthly
<!--
68 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
powers. "It is not given to man upon earth to
think actually of God at all times, ever actually to
love Him." The remaining degrees concern us
men in our state of pilgrimage below. The charity
of earth is twofold: the higher is that of such as
embrace and keep the Gospel counsels of perfection,
by professing voluntary Poverty, perpetual Chastity,
entire Obedience. All are in the state of perfection
who thus follow the Master out of love. The
lowest rank is of such as are only called to, and
are content with, what is of precept, the simple
keeping of the Commandments. Thus the Religious
State is one of perfection, but actual perfection is
the heroism of fulfilment, the bloodless martyrdom
of charity.<p>

In Rome during the whole Lent of 1267 our
Saint preached in the Old Saint Peter's Basilica:
taking Christ's Passion for his theme, he spoke so
strongly against public vices that a change of morals
was observable on all sides. During the Good
Friday sermon he wept aloud, so as to move the
whole audience to tears: on the Easter Day and
during the Octave he made them all to thrill with
joy and hope. As he was passing out through the
porch, a woman long afflicted with a flow of blood
came behind him, kissed his cloak, and was instantly 
cured. A remarkable Jewish conversion
made in the previous winter stirred the hearts of
the Romans. Cardinal d'Annibaldi having secured
Thomas for a few days' visit to his country residence
at Molara, invited two Rabbis to meet him, to enjoy
<!--
HIS WRITINGS: SECOND PERIOD. 69
-->
his rare gift of conversation. Polite speech soon
grew to argument between the well-measured opponents, 
regarding the Messiah, for it was Christmas
Eve. The Rabbis pleaded their cause with learning and 
earnestness, but all that they could advance
was met by clear proofs to the contrary, put before
them with all meekness and sincerity. They were
so tenacious of their convictions, however, that all
he said produced no immediate results: yet at the
same time they were so captivated by his manner,
that they promised to repeat the visit on the morrow.
That night of the Christmas mystery Thomas spent
before the new and abiding Bethlehem, "the home
of bread," on the altar: where argument failed,
prayer prevailed, and on Christmas Day he received
them into the Christian fold.<p>

The holy Doctor acknowledged to friends, that,
on every Christmas night, he obtained some special
favour from God, some vision, or deeper insight
into the glories of Christ. His exquisitely tender
devotion towards our Lord stands revealed in this
prayer<p>

"Most tender Jesus, may Thy most sacred Body
and Blood be my soul's sweetness and delight, health
and holiness in every temptation, joy and peace in
every sorrow, light and strength in every word and
work, and my last safeguard in death."<p>

St. Thomas was now held in universal esteem as
an oracle sent of God: halls and churches were
taxed to their utmost capacity to contain his eager
auditory, and those listeners were no mere youths,
<!--
70 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
but Doctors of the schools, Bishops and even Cardinals. 
He had such mastery over mind and senses
that he dictated to four secretaries at the one time
on widely different subjects, and was known to
dictate still while fast asleep. Such is the testimony
of two such secretaries, Reginald of Piperno and
Hervey Brito. So capacious was his memory, that
he never forgot what he had once read. One evening 
while dictating the treatise on the Holy Trinity,
he held the candle so as to assist the scribe: soon
he became so lost in sublime thought that he let the
candle burn out in his fingers, without being conscious of the pain.<p>

At Pentecost of the year 1267 he took part in the
General Chapter of Bologna, and witnessed the
solemn translation of St. Dominic's relics: it was
on this occasion that the Pope sent him a Brief 
requiring him to choose and send two friars to assist
the Bishop of Narenta in Dalmatia. The University 
prayed the Chapter to leave him in Bologna, so
he accepted a chair in the public schools. It was
a joy for him to live in the home wherein St. Dominic 
died: many were the nights he spent in prayer
before the Holy Father's tomb. It is an interesting
fact that he composed the questions on Beatitude
and the Beatific Vision in this hallowed spot. Out
of consideration for his merits, two new foundations
were bestowed upon the order. Archbishop Patricio 
Matteo gave St. Paul's church in Salerno, with
its houses and gardens, "to his friend and former
master, Thomas of Aquino". Abbot Bernard of
<!--
71 HIS WRITINGS: SECOND PERIOD.
-->
Monte Cassino, in a Synod of the clergy within his
jurisdiction, made over a similar establishment in
the town of San Germano.<p>

In 1268 the house of Aquino was restored in its
honours and estates, whereat the man of God
adored heaven's judgments and designs, even while
he poured out thanks. At the request of the Master
General he composed a short work on "The Form
of Absolution": for the King of Sicily he wrote the
first two books of the treatise "On the Government
of Princes," but the third and fourth are by some
other pen.<p>

Summoned to attend the General Chapter in
Paris in the year 1269, at the voice of authority he
remained there as Regent of Studies. The world
of letters might come to him, if it so listed, but he
would not go out to it, being pre-occupied with the
moral section of his "Summa". He continued on
terms of holy intimacy with St. Louis IX, until that
Preux Chevalier sailed for the Holy Land in 1270.
During his two years' residence in Paris he published
these works: "On the Soul"; on "Potentia";
"On the Union of the Word"; "On Spiritual Creatures"; 
"On the Virtues"; "On Evil".<p>

One day he accompanied the novices to the
abbey church of St. Denys, which was the burial
place of the Kings of France; there they sat a
while to rest upon a hillock, and surveyed the city
stretched before them. Hoping to hear some
words of wisdom, one of the party observed:
"Master, see what a splendid city Paris is; would
<!--
72 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
you not care to be its lord?" Thomas gazed
for a moment, then replied: "I would rather have
St. Chrysostom's Homilies on Matthew's Gospel.
What could I possibly do with such a city?" "Well
Father," rejoined the novice, "you might sell it to
the King of France, and build convents for the
Friars Preachers in many a place." "In good
sooth," said the saint, "I should prefer the Homilies.
If I had the government of this city, it would bring
me many cares: I could no longer give myself to
Divine contemplation, besides depriving myself of
spiritual consolations. Experience truly shows
this, that the more a man abandons himself to the
care and love of temporal things, the more he 
exposes himself to lose heavenly blessings." "O
happy Doctor," exclaims Tocco, "despiser of the
world! O lover of heaven! who carried out in conduct 
what he taught in words, who thus despised
earthly things, as if he had already caught a glimpse
of the heaven he was looking forward to possess."<p>

A man's character can be accurately measured by
his friendships. While bearing himself affably 
towards all, the Angelic Doctor had but few 
intimacies, and these were with persons of singular
holiness. Now since friendship is based on resemblance, 
and results in equality and expansiveness,
one is not surprised to find that his great heart
opened to the learned, many of whom are enrolled
with him in the catalogue of the Blessed.<p>

He kept perfect control over his emotional and
sensitive faculties. When the rude surgery of the
<!--
HIS WRITINGS: SECOND PERIOD. 73
-->
time required that he should be bled, and once
when it was deemed necessary to cauterize his knee
with a hot iron, he put himself into a state of 
contemplation, and felt nothing whatever of the 
operation. When preaching, he stood firm and erect,
the clasped hands resting on the pulpit, the eyes
closed, the head upturned and thrown somewhat
backwards. At table he often sat lost in thought,
with open eyes gazing upwards; it was the same in
the garden, the cloister, the cell. He frequently
gave this injunction to Reginald, his chief secretary:
"Whatever you see happen in me, do not interrupt
me". It was in 1270 he completed his Commentary on 
St. Paul's Epistles, during the composition
of which he was favoured with the visible appearance
of the Apostle, who came to his assistance in expounding 
the more abstruse passages.<p>

Recalled to Rome in 1271, he finished the second
section of the Second Part of his "Summa" in the
peaceful priory on the Aventine hill, and began the
Third Part. His time was now devoted to this
work, to daily lectures, and to writing a Commentary
on Boetius.<p>

St. Thomas possessed a master mind ranging
over the whole domain of Philosophy: after seven
centuries he is abreast of our times in science,
while not a few of our latter-day <i>"discoveries"</i> may
be read in his pages. The twentieth century has
gone back to him for its epistemology, or science
of doctrine, to his canon of <i>"Nihil in intellectu quin
priusfuerit in sensu"</i>. With him, ethics is no dry
<!--
74 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
digest of "agibilia," it is the most practical of the
sciences, for it is the shaping of human conduct.
The political and social economist must consult
him for sound economics, as Pope Leo XIII did
in his Encyclical "Rerum Novarum"; there in
many an eloquent passage he will find as the basis
of social economy man's fundamental right of
ownership, while the determination falls to the
State. In Psychology this sage holds firm for the
real distinction between soul and faculties, and 
between the faculties themselves; feeling is largely
identified with will, but he is no patron of Rosminian
consciousness as being the soul's nature. It is to
St. Thomas we go for the sound philosophical
principles of rational physics. His exposition of
cosmology, given in the treatise on Creation, which
is contained in the First Part of the "Summa
Theologica," is out and out more scientific than all
theories of atomism, chemical forces of dynamism,
or pretended affinities of later days. He is a
creationist, and holds to matter and form as the
substantialities of things. Primary matter is the
subject of all the substantial transformations of the
corporeal universe. Substantial form is the likeness 
of a Divine idea, which, being expressed in
matter, constitutes it in a determined substance:
as a consequence, the degrees of beings depend on
the perfection of forms.<p>

Nature is the first principle of motion and of
rest. All primitive substantial forms as well as
primary matter must come of creation: his teach<!--
HIS WRITINGS: SECOND PERIOD. 75
-->ing shows the impossibility of our modern biogenesis. 
The variation of gravity he explains not
by addition or subtraction of extraneous particles,
but by matter itself becoming rare or dense; hence
heaviness is a result of density. He was well 
acquainted with ether, admitting as he does of an
ethereal and most subtle bodily substance everywhere 
diffused in the interplanetary spaces, as the
vehicle and subject of the reciprocal operations of
the stars and planets. Such is the explanation of
the diffusion of light and heat, in agreement with
experience. Ages before Melloni he said: "All
light is productive of heat, even the light of the
Moon". Those who talk of sex in plants as a
modern discovery had better read his "Commentary
on the Third Book of 'Sentences'". "In the same
plant there is the twofold virtue, active and passive,
though sometimes the active is found in one, and
the passive in another, so that the one plant is
said to be masculine, and the other feminine."
[III," Sent.," Dist. III, Quest. II, art. 1.]
He was well acquainted with seminal causes, the
laws of qualities, attraction, mechanical activity,
and inertia of bodies: in the matter of chemistry
there is no substantial discrepancy between his
teaching and the true principles of modern science
as to substantial transformation.

CHAPTER VII.<p>

HIS HEROIC SANCTITY.<p>

OUR saint presented a very noble and striking
figure. He was of lofty stature, of heavy build but
well proportioned, while his countenance was of
our northern complexion, "like the colour of new
wheat," as we read in the deposition for his 
canonization. The features were comely, the head 
massive and well shaped, the forehead lofty, and he
was slightly bald. Judging from his portrait, the
general aspect was calm, sweet, majestic; the deep
meditative eyes speak of gentleness, the nose is
long and straight, the mouth very firm. Taken
altogether, the features reveal the inner charm of
his soul.<p>

The earliest known portrait is a superb painting
on a panel by an unknown artist of the fifteenth
century, now preserved in the Louvre at Paris. A
replica of inferior quality is to be seen in the 
suppressed Carmelite convent at Viterbo. An 
inscription beneath reads thus: "The true portrait
of the Angelic Doctor Saint Thomas Aquinas, as
described by a disciple ".<p>

He was the saint of sublimest thought, which he
nourished with' spiritual reading. "In such reading 
I try to collect devout thoughts, which will lead
me easily to contemplation."<p>

The basis of his character and conduct was holy
humility. The advice he tendered to others, he
<!--
ST. THOMAS AQUINAS. LUNETTE FRESCO IN
CLOISTER OF SAN MARCO, FLORENCE, BY
FRA ANGELICO DA FIESOLE.

-->
took to heart himself. "Love of God leads to 
self-contempt, whereas self-love leads to the contempt
of God. If you would raise on high the edifice
of holiness, take humility for your foundation."
In a moment of confidence he made this candid
avowal to Fr. Reginald of Piperno. "Thanks be
to God, my knowledge, my title of Doctor, my
scholastic work, have never occasioned a single
movement of vain glory, to dethrone the virtue of
humility in my heart." Dignities he would never
accept: he held no office in his Order. He declined 
the lordly abbacy of Monte Cassino, even
though the Pope offered to let him keep his habit
of a Friar Preacher. Clement IV tried to secure
his acceptance of a Cardinal's hat, and expedited
the Brief creating him Archbishop of Naples, but
all to no purpose; when death was in view, he
uttered this exclamation: "Thanks be to God, I
die as a simple religious".<p>

He was very tenacious of poverty; all his
journeys were made on foot, his habit was of the
poorest, he kept rigidly to the common life. Fr.
Nicholas de Marsiliaco has furnished us with this
testimony: "I was in Paris with Fr. Thomas, and
I declare before God that never have I seen in
any man such degree of innocence, such love of
poverty. In writing his 'Sum against the Gentiles' 
he had not sufficient copy-books, so he wrote
it on scraps of paper, although he might have had
books in abundance, had he been so minded, but
he had no concern for temporal affairs." If mitre
<!--
78 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
and scarlet had no attractions, still less had the
rich revenues of an abbey, St. Peter <i>ad Aram</i>, in
Rome, when offered by Pope Clement. He would
keep nothing for his personal use, no chalice, no
manuscript, while he held dainties in abhorrence,
and practised austerities.<p>

As to obedience, it was one of his sayings that
an obedient man is the same as a saint. He
was just as prompt and hearty in obeying his Prior
as in obeying the Father-General, or our Lord the
Pope. A lay-brother in Bologna, having occasion
to go out of the convent to make some necessary
purchases for the table, had leave to summon the
first friar he met to bear him company, as the rule
required. St. Thomas was pacing the cloister at
the moment, to whom the brother spoke thus:
"Good father, the Prior wants you to follow me
through the town". Thomas complied, but as they
strode through streets and market he was unable
to maintain the pace, being slightly lame, for which
he was soundly rated more than once. The
amazed townsfolk interposed with heated speech,
reminding the testy one of his companion's dignity,
to say nothing of his infirmity. The simple brother
fell at once to his knees to implore forgiveness, for
he had no idea of the strange father's name or
rank: St. Thomas, however, reassured him by saying
that each was simply carrying out an obedience.
It was then he uttered the oft-quoted maxim:
"Obedience is the perfection of religious life:
thereby a man submits himself to his fellow-man
<!--
HIS HEROIC SANCTITY. 79
-->
for the love of God, just as God became obedient
to men for their salvation".<p>

With regard to the holy chastity, the Angelic
Doctor is both patron and pattern of the angelic
virtue: youth and maiden, priest and cloistered soul,
acclaim him alike as their model and protector.
"Incorruption bringeth nearer to God" (Wisdom,
vi. 20). In his "Commentary on St. Paul's
Corinthians, "Chapter VII, lesson 6, he rehearses
eight blessings of Virginity.<p>

1. It preserves cleanness of the flesh. 2. It
beautifies and adorns the soul. 3. It makes like
unto the Angels of heaven. 4. It espouses to the
Christ. 5. It gives union with and closeness to
God. 6. It surpasses other states. 7. It breathes
forth the odour of good repute. 8. It invites to
the eternal nuptials. Of these the most valuable
are the fourth, fifth, and last. It espouses unto the
Christ by giving fitness for union with Christ's
Body in Holy Communion, and to the priest for
making, handling, and dispensing the same. Hence
the Poet Virgil places the life-long chaste priest in
the Elysian fields.<p>

<blockquote>
Quique sacerdotes casti, dum vita manebat.<br>
 -- AEneid, vi. 66i.
</blockquote><p>

It gives union with God, and closeness, by bestowing 
fitness for contemplation. "Where there is
cleanness there is understanding;" "What removes a 
hindrance is an indirect mover," as St.
Thomas constantly urges. Chastity lends fitness
<!--
80 THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
for contemplation by removing carnal desires, which
so affect the mind's eye that even the truest see sin
through a distorted lens. Lastly, it invites to the
eternal nuptials. The closer anything approaches
to its principle, the more perfect it becomes: but
God, Who is our Principle, is a most Pure Spirit:
therefore, Chastity leads up to perfection. But
our last end is to be one of inseparable union with
the all-clean God, as guests at the nuptials of the
Lamb; therefore Chastity disposes for such union.
The saint lived and died a perfect virgin in mind
and body: his heroism in youth drew Angels down
from heaven. "He who loves cleanness of heart,
for the grace of his lips, shall have the King for a
friend" (Proverbs xxii. 11)<p>

The depth of his Divine love, God alone can
sound: it was revealed in a measure by his life,
but he never spoke of it. "It is a good thing to
conceal the King's secret" (Tobias XII. 7). All the
world read his heart, his human kindness, his deep
friendships. No hard saying ever crossed his lips:
he could slay an argument, yet spare a foe. Without
guile in his own soul, he could with difficulty be
brought to believe in the guilt of others. When
he sat in the tribunal of penance, in God's Mercy-seat, 
it was with a melting heart of pity. Two
things he loved especially: these were the Order
of Preachers, and God's poor. From love of the
brethren he blessed the church bell at Salerno,
foretelling that it would toll of itself to give warning
of an approaching death. It kept its miraculous
<!--
HIS HEROIC SANCTITY. 81
-->
power until it fell and was broken in the seventeenth
century.
[1 Its power was still attested in 1678.]
Like St. Dominic he was "ever joyous
in the sight of men," uniting the grace of noble
manners to the reserve of the religious. He 
inculcated and observed the remembrance of God's
presence. "Be assured," he would say, "that he
who walks faithfully in God's presence, and who is
ready to give Him an account of his actions, will
never be parted from Him by yielding to sin.<p>

Prayer was for him the very breath of his life.
Frequently he urged St. Augustine's maxim: "He
knows how to live rightly, who has learnt how to
pray properly". In the funeral discourse at his
obsequies, Fr. Reginald bore this testimony:
"During life my Master always prevented me from
revealing the wonders which I witnessed. Of this
number was his marvellous learning which uplifted
him beyond all other men, which he owed less to
power of genius than to the efficacy of his prayer.
Truly, before studying, or lecturing, reading, writing,
or dictating, he began by shutting himself up in
secret prayer: he prayed with tears, so as to obtain
from God the understanding of His mysteries, and
then lights came in abundance to illumine his mind.
When he encountered a difficulty, he had recourse
to prayer, and all his doubts vanished."<p>

The Angelic teacher was likewise an Angelic
singer: nothing but inability from sickness ever
kept him from Choir duty. In the opening of his
treatise, "On the Separated Substances," that is,
<!--
82 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
the Angels, he acknowledges his absence for a time
from Divine praise in the Choir, due to frequent
attacks of sickness. "Being deprived of assisting
at the solemnities of the Angels, we must not allow
a time consecrated to devotion to be unoccupied,
but rather compensate by study for the loss of
assisting at the Divine Office."<p>

His devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary was
tender and deep, as evinced by his writings, and by
this prayer: --<p>

"Dearest and most blessed Virgin Mary, Mother
of God, overflowing with affection, Daughter of the
Sovereign King, and Queen of the Angels: Mother
of Him Who created all things, this day and all the
days of my life I commend to the bosom of thy
regard my soul and my body, all my actions,
thoughts, wishes, desires, words, and deeds, my
whole life, and my end: so that through thy prayers
they may all be ordered according to the will of thy
beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Lady most
holy, be my helper and my comforter against the
attacks and snares of the ancient foe, and of all my
enemies."<p>

A few days before his death he told Fr. Reginald
that Christ's dear Mother had appeared to him on
several occasions, assuring him that his life and
writings were pleasing to God, and that he would
persevere in his state. St. Vincent Ferrer and St. 
Antoninus of Florence affirm that in his difficulties he
used to turn to her as a child to a mother. Then
she would stand visibly before him, and, turning
<!--
HIS HEROIC SANCTITY. 83
-->
with a smile to the Divine Babe in her arms, ask
Him to bestow the enlightenment he sought.<p>

A complete Mariology has been compiled from
his works, drawing out Mary's singular graces.
[The work of Rev. Dr. Morgott, Ratisbon.]
He upheld the privilege of her exemption from original
sin. It is an old-established saying, that, "with St.
Thomas a man can never be wrong, nor can he be
right without him". That he upheld Mary's sinless
conception can be established from extrinsic and
intrinsic evidences. It is the verdict of his 
weightiest exponents, such as Capponi de Porrecta,
Joannes a Sancto Thoma, Natalis Alexander, John
Bromeyard of Oxford, and many more. At the
Council of Basle, John of Segobia upheld the 
Immaculate Conception from St. Thomas's writings.
Theologians of first rank have held the same view,
such as Vega, Eichof, Nieremberg, Sylveira, Thyrsus
Gonzalez, Stefano Chiesa, Plazza, Spada, Cornoldi,
Cardinal Sfondrato, Cardinal Lambruschini, etc.<p>

If we open his writings we have the intrinsic
evidences of various passages. In his "Opusculum,"
LXI, <i>de Dilectione Dei, et Proximi</i>, we meet this
passage: "For the more complete manifestation
of His power, the Creator made a mirror which is
brightest of the most bright, more polished and
more pure than the Seraphim, and of such great
purity that there can not be imagined one more
pure, except it were God: and this mirror is the
person of the most glorious Virgin".<p>

In his "Commentary on the First Book of the
<!--
84 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
"Sentences,'" he twice makes use of this sentence:
"The Blessed Virgin Mary shone with a purity
greater than which under God cannot be comprehended." 
(Dist. XVII, Quest. II, art. 4, 3<sup><small>m</small></sup>). 
Here is his proof: "Increase of purity is to be measured
according to withdrawal from its opposite, and
since in the Blessed Virgin there was 'depuratia'
from <i>all</i> sin, she consequently attained the summit
of purity; but yet under God, in Whom there is no
capability of defect as is in every creature of itself".
And again he writes in Dist. XLIV, Quest. I, art 3
"Purity is increased by withdrawal from its opposite, 
and consequently some created being can
be found <i>purer than which nothing can be found in
creatures</i>, if never sullied by defilement of sin, and
such was the purity of the Blessed Virgin, <i>who was
exempt from original and actual sin</i>". Some think
that the expression <i>"depuratio"</i> argues cleansing
from stain; but such was not the meaning which St.
Thomas attached to the word. The Holy Fathers
frequently use this word with regard to God Himself. 
St. Augustine, Peter Lombard, Fulgentius,
Ferrandus, Hugh of St. Victor, also use it of God,
while a whole host of writers employ it when speaking 
of Christ: St. Thomas uses it twice in his
treatise on the Incarnation, and Dionysius makes
use of it with regard to the heavenly Hierarchies.
So then, <i>"depuratio ab omni peccato"</i> does not mean
"cleansing from all sin," but "exemption from all
sin". The Angelic Doctor knew the scientific
value of the term used, and his critics do not.
<!--
HIS HEROIC SANCTITY. 85
-->
The expression used above "immunis a peccato"
is the one employed by Pope Pius IX in proclaiming 
the dogma.<p>

There is no need to expatiate on the fact that
St. Thomas was a consummate logician, and consequently 
not likely to teach in one part of his
writings the contrary to what he lays down in
another. In the First Part of the "Summa Theologica," 
Question XXV, art. 6, ad. 4, he writes:
"The Blessed Virgin, in that she is the Mother
of God, <i>has a kind of infinite dignity</i> from 
the Infinite Good, which is God, and on this account
nothing better than her can be made, just as there
~is nothing better than God ". Again in the Third
Part, Question XXVII, art. 3, he says: "The closer
a thing approaches to its principle in any order,
the more it partakes of the effect of such principle.
Hence Dionysius states in the fourth chapter of
the 'Heavenly Hierarchies,' that 'the angels being
nearer to God, share more fully of the Divine 
perfections than men do'. But Christ is the principle
of grace <i>authoritatively</i> according to His Divinity
and <i>instrumentally</i> in His humanity, as St. John
declares in the first chapter (of the Gospel).
<i>'Grace and truth are made through our Lord Jesus
Christ.'</i> But the Blessed Virgin <i>was closest to Christ</i>
in His humanity, since He drew His human nature
from her, and therefore <i>she ought beyond all others</i>
to receive the fullness of grace from Christ."<p>

From these two passages we gather St. Thomas's
teaching as to Mary's prerogatives. 1. She pos<!--
86 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->sessed an almost infinite dignity from her closeness
to God, in this surpassing the angels. 2. She ought,
that is, she had the right, to receive the fullness of
Divine grace beyond all other creatures. Since then
it is the work of grace to purify the soul by imparting 
to it the Divine beauty, it follows necessarily that
grace wrought absolute sinlessness in her soul, and
created boundless holiness. In this dual capacity
of closest union with God, and being the appointed
instrument of Christ's humanity, she surpassed the
angels, who never knew sin: she had a kind of
infinitude in merit which none of them ever could
have. How then can such teaching of St. Thomas
be reconciled with the idea that Mary had ever been
sullied for an instant with original sin? Let the
theory be once admitted that Mary had been so
defiled, then his two principles given above fall to
the ground; admit his principles, and the Immaculate 
Conception is the logical result. The holy
Doctor was well aware of the grace bestowed on
those pre-eminent saints, Jeremiah and John the
Baptist, yet he does not hesitate to place Mary
incomparably beyond them, and attributes their
sanctification to her as well as to her son. She
must then, logically speaking, have received a greater
grace than cleansing after conception.<p>

In his exposition of the "Hail Mary" he distinctly 
declares the doctrine. "Thirdly, she exceeds
even the angels in purity: because the Blessed
Virgin was not only pure in herself, but even procured 
purity for others. She was most clean from
<!--
87 HIS HEROIC SANCTITY.
-->
fault, because she incurred neither original, nor
mortal, nor venial sin."<p>

In his "Commentary on the Epistle to Galatians,"
III, lect. VI, the original text runs thus: "Of all
women I have found none who was altogether exempt 
from sin, at least from original sin, or venial,
except the most pure, and most worthy of all praise,
the Virgin Mary".<p>

Again in his "Commentary on the Epistle to Romans": 
"All men have sinned in Adam, excepting only the most 
Blessed Virgin, who contracted no stain of Original Sin".<p>

Such are the readings of the first MS. Codices
and early printed versions. In a marginal note
written by St. Vincent Ferrer in his copy of the
"Summa," Part III, Question XXVII, art. 2, ad. 2m,
are these words: "The Blessed Virgin was exempt
from original and actual sin". It was these original
texts of early manuscript Codices which early 
defenders of the Immaculate Conception quoted for
their opinion, such as St. Leonard of Port Maurice,
Bernardine de Bustis, B. Peter Canisius, Cardinal
Sfondrato, Salmeron, and many more. Weighty
theologians such as Velasquez, Peter of Alva, Eusebius 
Nieremberg, Frassen, Lambruschini, Gual, and
Palmieri, following the critical method of Hermeneutics, 
have held and shown that many passages
of St. Thomas have been changed or interpolated.
Let it suffice to adduce three apologetic writers who
denounce such practices, and vindicate the purity
of his text. Bishop Vialmo, a Friar Preacher:
<!--
88 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
"Pro defensione Sancti Thomae"; Egidius Romanus, a 
disciple of St. Thomas "Castigatorium:
in corruptorem librorum S. Thomae Aquinatis";
Cardinal Sfondrato: "Innocentia Vindicata"; 
besides seven more apologists.<p>

Some of the Angelic Doctor's neat sayings
caught in familiar conversation have been preserved.
"The poverty of a discontented religious is a useless 
expense." "The prayerless soul makes no
progress whatever." "A religious without prayer
resembles a soldier fighting without weapons."
"Idleness is the devil's hook, on which any bait is
tempting." "I cannot understand how anyone
conscious of mortal sin can laugh or be merry."
When asked how to detect a spiritual-minded man,
he gave this reply: "He who is constantly chattering 
about frivolous things, who fears being despised,
who is weary of life, whatever marvels he may work,
I do not look on him as a perfect man, since all he
does is without foundation, and he who cannot
suffer is ready for a fall". To his sister Theodora,
inquiring how to become a saint, he replied with
a single word, "Velle," or "Resolve".<p>

It is not surprising that one so clean of heart
and full of charity should be favoured with visions,
or that the dead should make an appeal to his pity.
Thus, in earlier years he foresaw the triumph of
the Mendicant Friars, while they were being subjected 
to persecution. "A Doctor of Theology in
Paris, a man of great reputation and learning, and
one who rendered signal services to the Church,
<!--
HIS HEROIC SANCTITY. 89
-->
during the time that the Master-General was doing
battle for the order in the Roman Court, at the
trying period when bitter enmity prevailed against
the brethren, saw in a dream a great concourse of
friars looking up to heaven, who called out to him;
'Look! Look!' He also gazed upwards, and
saw these words emblazoned in letters of gold upon
the sky: 'The Lord has delivered us from our
enemies, and from the hands of all them that hated
us'. At that very time the Brief issued by Pope
Innocent against the Mendicant Friars was recalled
by Alexander his successor, through the favour of
the Most High" (Gerard de Frachet, "Lives of
the Brethren," Book IV, Chap. xxiii.).<p>

His deceased sister, Marietta, the Abbess of
Capua, appeared to him in Paris in the year 1272,
to commend her soul to his prayers: some time
later she reappeared in Rome to tell him that she
was admitted to glory. When he inquired about
his dead brothers Raynald and Landulf she assured
him that the former was already in paradise, but
that the latter was still in purgatory. Then, 
emboldened, he put the question as to whether he
would himself die before long, and secure his
eternal salvation. To this she replied: "You will
be saved, if you but persevere, but you will attain
your last end very differently from us; you will
speedily join us, but your glory will quite surpass
ours". Shortly after this he was consoled by the
vision of an angel displaying a book, on which the
names of the saints were written in golden letters
<!--
90 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
on an azure ground, and among them he saw
Raynald's name among the martyrs. The angel
disappeared, and Raynald stood visibly before him.
"How do I stand with God?" was our saint's first
question. "You are in a good state, my brother.
Such a query is unbecoming, because you are in
the sure way which leads to life. Hold fast to what
you now have, and finish as you have begun: learn
also for a certainty, that none of your Order, or very
few, will be lost."<p>

CHAPTER VIII.<p>

HIS WRITINGS; THIRD PERIOD: AND DEATH.<p>

THE completion of the Moral Section of the "Summa" 
raised St. Thomas to the height of fame.
The Universities of Paris, Bologna, and Naples,
sent eager applications to have him, addressed to
the General Chapter sitting in Florence during the
Pentecost-tide of 1272. Rome lost him, as there
was no reigning Pontiff to retain him, and Naples
won him. The Capitular fathers assigned him to
teach in Naples University, at the earnest suit of
Charles, King of Sicily, the brother of St. Louis,
who contributed two ounces of gold per month
for his maintenance. Late in the month of August, 
Thomas quitted Rome in company with his
brethren Reginald of Piperno and Bartholomew
of Lucca.<p>

All three fell sick of malaria at Cardinal 
d'Annibaldi's residence in the Campagna. Thomas
<!--
THIRD PERIOD: AND DEATH. 91
-->
speedily recovered, but his companions lay in grave
danger of their lives, so, drawing from his neck a
relic of St. Agnes, he applied it with his blessing,
whereat they rose instantly in perfect health.<p>

The home-coming of the Angelic Doctor to
Naples was a veritable triumph. Five miles beyond 
the city he was met by princes, senators,
professors, and the ever-clamorous youth of a
University; an immense concourse of citizens
filled the festive streets, roaring out their ovation,
while the reverend magistracy conducted him to
his convent of San Domenico Maggiore. Such
demonstrations deeply wounded his humility: 
fortunately for himself his habitual recollection of
thought kept him unconscious of the respectful
salutions which greeted his every appearance in the
public streets. Shortly after his arrival the Cardinal
Legate of Sicily and the Archbishop of Capua, a
former disciple, went to consult with him on matters
of grave moment: on being informed of their
arrival, the holy Doctor descended from his cell to
the open cloister, but so rapt in thought that he
passed them unnoticed. Presently his face brightened, 
and they heard him exclaim: "I have hit
upon the solution I was looking for". The Cardinal 
looked shocked for a moment at the apparent
discourtesy, until the Archbishop assured him that
such moments of abstraction were priceless to the
Church; then, pulling Thomas by the sleeve, he
roused him from his reverie. Then only did the
man of God observe them, and in simple language
<!--
92 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
explained the mystery of his joyful mien. "It was
merely because an excellent argument on a long-debated 
subject occurred just then to my mind,
whose inner contemplation was expressed on my
joyful countenance."<p>

His end was close at hand, like a goal in sight;
the words from the world behind the veil were
vividly impressed on his memory: "You will
speedily join us". In his cell he prayed and wrote,
then passed forth to lecture in the University, in
whose Aula Maxima he delivered the treatises of the 
Third Part of the "Summa Theologica," beginning 
with the Incarnation. The pulpit and
chair from which he lectured were preserved for
centuries after, together with his statue in marble
in the outer atrium, where a marble slab bore this
inscription<p>

"Before passing in, pay reverence to this statue,
and to the chair from which Saint Thomas pronounced 
so many oracles to a countless throng of
students, for the glory and happiness of his age".<p>

Every morning he said mass at an early hour in
St. Nicholas Chapel, after which he heard another;
he made his thanksgiving still vested in alb and
girdle, but when he served mass, he resumed the
black cappa. At the moment of consecration he
used his favourite ejaculation: <i>"Tu Rex gloriae,
Christe. Tu Patris sempiternus es Filius"</i>. His Vesper 
hour of life had come, and he welcomed it: during 
the year 1273 his raptures became more
and more frequent; seldom he went out, except to
<!--
THIRD PERIOD: AND DEATH. 93 
-->
deliver the daily lecture. Now that the Commentary
on Boetius was finished, his philosophic labours
were ended. His pre-occupying theme now was
the Sacred Godhead. As revealed in prophecy, it
is the gist of his exposition of Isaiah: as revealed
in the Incarnation and Redemption, it is the burden
of the "Summa" in its concluding part. One night
his friend and secretary, Reginald, who occupied
the cell next to his, heard him talking in a loud tone
as if engaged in animated conversation, which was
the more remarkable since it was being carried on
in time of profound silence. After a while Thomas
came to his cell and bade him to get up. "Light
the lamp, and bring the manuscript which I have
begun upon Isaiah:" for a long space of time he
dictated rapidly, then told him to retire again to
rest. Reginald then threw himself upon his knees,
and besought him to tell with whom he had been
conversing. Finally, in God's dear name and in
the name of their friendship, he adjured him to
speak. "Dear son," replied the saint, "for many
days past you have witnessed my affliction of spirit.
I had misgivings over a passage in the text I have
been commenting upon, so that I besought God
with tears to give me understanding. Now this
very night God has had compassion upon me, sending 
me His blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, who
have brought me complete light. And now, in
God's name, I command you to keep absolute silence
as to this fact, during my lifetime."
After the Commentary on Isaiah he wrote his
<!--
94 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
Exposition of the first fifty-one Psalms. During
the Lent of this year he preached every day in the
Cathedral upon the words, <i>"Hail full of grace, the
Lord is with thee,"</i> giving a summary of Mary's rare
privileges. The Compline hour at home filled
him with the deepest devotion: tears coursed freely
during the singing of the Lenten anthem: <i>"Cast
us not off in the season of our old age, when our
strength shall fail us: Lord God, do not forsake us"</i>.
As he was praying in the choir, he saw before him
the figure of Father Romanus, to whom he had
relinquished his chair in Paris. "Welcome indeed,
dear brother," said he; "but when did you arrive
here?" "I have passed from life," said the dead
friar, "but I am permitted to appear on your account." 
St. Thomas was much overcome, but recovering 
self-possession, put these apt questions:
"How do I stand with God, and are my works
pleasing to Him?" "Thou art in a good state,
and thy works are pleasing to God." "What then
of thyself?" asked the holy Doctor. "I am in
bliss," replied Romanus, "but have passed sixteen
days in Purgatory." "Tell me then," cried Thomas,
"how do the Blessed see God, and do our acquired
habits abide with us in heaven?" "It is enough,"
answered Romanus, "if I tell you that I see God:
ask me no more: <i>'As we have heard, so have we
seen, in the city of the Lord of Hosts'</i>:" saying which
he vanished. The Angelic Doctor at once gave
voice to his conclusion: "therefore it is by specular
vision that the Blessed see God".
<!--
THIRD PERIOD: AND DEATH. 95
--><p>

The servant of God was permitted at times to
penetrate men's hidden thoughts: one such instance
was when he rebuked a friar for leaving the choir
to indulge in gluttony. As he was pacing the
terrace conversing with a nobleman, the devil 
appeared under the guise of a negro: "How dare
you come here to tempt me!" he shouted as he
advanced with clenched fist; whereupon the fiend
vanished.<p>

The year 1273 was drawing to a close when the
pen dropped from his hand, before reaching his
fiftieth year. It was on St. Nicholas Day, the 6th
day of December, and in that saint's chapel, that he
had a long ecstasy while saying Mass; what was then
communicated to him he never revealed, but from
that hour "he suspended his writing instruments," as
William de Tocco puts it. Frequently he had been
observed to be raised several cubits in the air,
while engaged in prayer. Directly the treatise on
the Eucharist was finished, some two months before
this, Fr. Dominic di Caserta and other friars saw
him thus uplifted in St. Nicholas Chapel shortly 
before Matins; but what filled them with awe was the
miraculous voice proceeding from the mouth of the
crucifix over the altar. "Thomas, thou hast written
well of Me; what reward wilt thou have?" To
which the holy man at once replied: "None other
but Thyself, Lord ". Mid-way in the treatise of the
Sacrament of Penance, after finishing ninety Questions, 
of five hundred and forty-nine articles, he
lapsed into silence. To every appeal made by
<!--
96 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
superiors or brethren there came the same reply:
"I can do no more". Fr. Reginald, his secretary
and confidant, urged him to resume his task.
"Father, why do you leave unfinished this great
work, which you have undertaken for God's glory
and the world's enlightenment?" But he could only
draw the reply: "I can do no more. Such secrets
have been communicated to me, that all I have
written and taught seem to me to be only like a
handful of straw." Few could credit the report
that the great oracle would speak no more; none
imagined that the sun was setting, and in part
already below the horizon. Nobly has Dante sung
of him in his "Paradiso," Canto X<p>

<blockquote>
Such his wisdom upon earth,<br>
Like to the Cherubim in lustre glowed.<br>
. . . . . . . . . .<br>
One of the lambs of that blest flock was I<br>
Which Dominic so leads in righteous ways,<br>
They thrive, unless they fall by vanity.<br>
</blockquote><p>

The "Summa Theologica" was his legacy to the
Church.
[A study of this monumental work has wrought many
remarkable conversions, such as Rabbi Paul of Burgos, in
the fifteenth century; Theobald Thamer, a disciple of
Melanchthon; the Calvinist, Duperron, afterwards Cardinal
and Archbishop of Sens. It has earned Luther's invectives,
as well as Bucer's menace: "Take away Thomas, and I
will destroy the Church".]<p>

Fr. Reginald was obliged to feed him now,
owing to his constant abstraction and frequent
raptures. Before the Christmas festival St. Thomas
<!--
THIRD PERIOD: AND DEATH. 97
-->
spent a week with his sister, the Countess of San
Severino, during which time they had but one long
conversation, and that was about the joys of life 
everlasting. "What can have happened to my brother,"
she inquired of Reginald of Piperno, "that he is
so entranced, and will not speak to me?" On his
return to Naples he fell ill of fever; the attendant
informed the prior that during the night he perceived 
a brilliant star enter by the window, and rest
for a long time on the sleeper's head.<p>

In obedience to Pope Gregory's summons to
attend at the General Council of Lyons, which
was to open on 1 May, St. Thomas quitted Naples
on 28 January, 1274, taking with him by papal
command his treatise "Against the Errors of the
Greeks". He set out on foot, having for companions 
the trusty Reginald and another friar; so
pre-occupied was he in thought, that, as they 
descended from Terracina along the Borgo Nuovo
road, he struck his head violently against a fallen tree
and lay stunned for some time. From that moment
Reginald never left his side, but sought to occupy
his mind by agreeable conversation. "Master, you
are going to the Council on behalf of our order and
of the kingdom of Naples." "God grant that I
may see this great good accomplished," was the 
reply. "And furthermore," pursued Reginald, "they
will make you a Cardinal, like Friar Bonaventure, 
so that both of you will be of great service to
the Orders of which you are members." To this
came the prophetic reply, confirmed by the event:
<!--
98 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
"There is no state in which I can be of more use
to my Order than that in which I am at present:
rest assured that I shall never change my state of
life". They halted for a few hours at Aquino;
there he received a letter from the Abbot of Monte
Cassino, soliciting his interpretation of a point of
Rule, to which he returned a gracious reply. Owing
to his failing strength, a mule was procured, upon
which he rode to visit his niece, the Countess
Francesca Ceccano at Maienza Castle. There he
fell ill, and could take no food; it was now the
season of Lent, and, since he would not break the
law of abstinence, the doctor begged of him to say
if there was any kind of food he could relish. "I
have several times eaten in France a kind of fish
called herring," said he; "but it is rare and very
dear in these parts." His physician, John de
Guido, sought vainly for the fish, until chancing to
meet a fisherman coming from Terracina, he found
some herrings at the bottom of a creel of sardines.
Then Reginald coaxed him to eat some of the 
herrings. "From whence do they come?" asked the
holy Master. "It is God who has sent them," was
the reply; but all the same he would not partake of
them, for fear of indulging in a delicacy. He tarried
five days in Maienza Castle, and was able to say
mass twice: the Abbot and some of the Cistercians
from Fossa Nuova Abbey came to pay their respects.
Thomas was now extremely ill, but persisted in 
fulfilling his obedience by proceeding onwards to the
Council. Once more he mounted upon the mule,

and the little party of ten moved slowly on to the
Abbey, just seven miles away. Reverently they
lifted him and carried him at his request into the
church, for his last visit to the Blessed Sacrament:
after a short prayer he was again taken up and
carried through the cloisters to the Abbot's own
apartments. Reginald had besought him not to quit
Maienza Castle, where he could have every remedy
and attention, but the saint would not listen to the
proposal. "If the Lord wishes to take me, it is
better that I should be found in a religious house
than in the establishment of the laity." He entered
Fossa Nuova Abbey on 10 February; as he was
borne through the cloisters he uttered the saying of
the Psalmist: "This is my rest for ever: here I
shall dwell, for I have chosen it" (Psalm cxxxi. 14).
The good Cistercians lavished every attention upon
him, cutting and carrying faggots for the fire.
"Whence comes this honour," he cried, in distress
of humility, "that holy men should carry wood for
my fire! Whence comes it that God's servants
should wait upon me, and carry a burden so far,
which must be painful to them!" Very speedily
the tidings reached Naples that his dissolution was
at hand; soon the Abbey was thronged with nobility
and clergy and brethren, importuning to see him
but once again. Among the Friars Preachers came
his younger brother Rayner, who afterwards became
Archbishop of Messina in Sicily.
[The Bullarium Ordinis Praedicatorum, Tome II, gives
him among the prelates promoted by Pope Honorius IV.

During an interval of the intermittent fever the
Cistercians besought him to dictate an exposition
of the Canticle of Canticles. "Give me St.
Bernard's spirit, and I will do so," said he.
Touched by their kindness, he complied: supported
on his bed, he dictated the Commentary as Reginald
read each succeeding verse, while eager hands 
committed it to writing. This, let it be observed, was
his second exposition of Solomon's Song; it is
entitled "Sonet vox tua," whereas the first is 
entitled "Salomon inspiratus ". This second work
must be accepted rather as the fruit of his piety
than of his learning. His biographer, William de
Tocco, makes this observation on the fact: "It
was fitting that the great Doctor, now about to be
released from the body, should finish his teaching
by the Canticle of Love between Jesus Christ and
the faithful soul". The last words dictated were a
passage from St. Paul, so fully realized in himself:
<i>"Our conversation is in heaven for in every place
we are unto God the good odour of Christ"</i>. On
coming to the eleventh verse of the seventh chapter
-- <i>"Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the fields,"</i>
he swooned away, for his end was near. As the
lamp of vitality was burning low, he received the
<!--

-->
last anointing after confessing to Fr. Reginald.
The Abbot then brought him the Sacred Viaticum,
while the brethren knelt around. Upborne in
Reginald's arms the dying saint made this protestation 
of faith: "If in this world there be any knowledge 
of this mystery keener than that of faith, I
wish now to use it to affirm that I believe in the
real presence of Jesus Christ in this Sacrament,
truly God and truly man, the Son of God, the Son
of the Virgin Mary. This I believe and hold for
true and certain. This faith is in my heart, and I
profess it with my lips, just as the priest has 
pronounced it."<p>

To Fr. Reginald it seemed impossible that St.
Thomas should die thus early, when only entering
upon his fiftieth year, so he used every art to rouse
him, especially by dwelling on the great work which
was before him in the coming Council, and of the
sure honours which awaited him. Then with dying
breath the holy Doctor made his last reply: "My
son, keep yourself from harbouring any such
thoughts, or from troubling yourself in this matter.
What used to be at one time the object of my
desires, is now a matter of thanksgiving. What I
have ever been asking of God He now grants to
me this day, in withdrawing me from this life in
the same state in which it pleased His mercy to
place me. Without a doubt I might have made
further progress in learning, and have made my 
learning to be more profitable to others, by sharing with
them what has been manifested to me. But the
<!--
102 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
infinite goodness of my God has let me know, that
if, without any merit of my own, I have received
more graces and lights than other Doctors who
have lived a long while, it is because the Lord
wished to shorten the days of my exile, and to take
me the sooner to be a sharer in His glory, out of
a pure act of mercy. If you love me sincerely, be
content and comforted, since my own consolation
is perfect."<p>

After receiving the Holy Viaticum he closed his
eyes, and was silent for a short time, then repeated
aloud his devout Rhythm:<p>

<blockquote>
Adoro Te devote, latens deitas,<br>
quae sub his figuris vere latitas.
</blockquote><p>

He uttered this Divine song to the finish, and
yielded up his soul in the early morning of 7
March, 1274.<p>
