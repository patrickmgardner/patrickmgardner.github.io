CHAPTER III.<p>

HIS STUDIES AT COLOGNE AND PARIS.<p>

THE Master-General at this time was the Venerable
John of Wildeshausen, formerly a missionary, and
Bishop of Bosnia. Knowing well the worth and
rare abilities of his subject, he resolved on giving
him the best opportunities for developing his
singular powers. The first step was to remove him
far from the importunities and distractions of home.
The school presided over by Albertus Magnus in
Cologne being in his judgment the best suited for
the purpose, the holy man set out from Rome with
Br. Thomas, in October, 1245. But since business of 
the order required the Father-General's
presence in Paris, they proceeded thither on foot,
carrying nothing but a satchel and a breviary.
In those days of faith it was a familiar scene to pass
Churchmen of every degree upon the road; now
bishops and abbots, mounted on well-caparisoned
horses, and with a retinue of retainers; now the
beneficed clergy riding in company, or with the
stout burgesses, and a few men at arms for pro<!--

-->tection; or else it might be the more modest 
company of monks and friars and pilgrims, all afoot,
and even the veiled minchins on palfreys. The
travellers sped on commonly like two streams in
their channels, going to or else returning from the
threshold of the holy Apostles in Rome. But
apart from this throng, it was of daily occurrence
to see the hooded friars of various orders wending
their way in couples or trios apart, and ever on foot,
across the Alps to the greater schools on either side
of the mountains, or journeying afar to attend
General Chapters. There was a constant movement 
going on over those rough roads which were
the arteries of European life, and across many a
river and mountain.<p>

Fr. John of Wildeshausen and Br. Thomas
Aquinas, stooping age and vigorous youth, thought
lightly of a journey afoot extending over 1500
miles. They set out each morning and walked a
good space, now conversing familiarly, now reciting 
the breviary or in silent meditation, until by
some running brook they opened their wallets for
the mid-day repast. At sunset they sought for
lodging in some religious establishment, or hospice,
or else under the roof of God-fearing folk. Such
had been St. Dominic's manner of travelling, and
that of all the mediaeval saints, and now from this
first experience St. Thomas grew familiar with it.
It was a weary task at the outset, until the traveller
came to be inured; but the free play of the
muscles supplies a vigour and freshness unknown

-->
to them who lag at home. But at the same time
men's sense of Christian hospitality was more 
universal than in our day, and no one wearing the
livery of Christ was ever turned from a Christian
door: true enough, beds were often lacking, but
then there was the fragrant hay in the cottar's loft,
and the lowing of the cattle at night was a reminder 
of Bethlehem. In this fashion the aged
bishop and his son in Christ plodded on across the
rainy plains of Lombardy in sad November, crossed
the biting Alpine passes in December, and, following 
the Valley of the Rhone, pressed northwards
towards Paris. Their brief halt in the French
capital was spent in the great Priory of St. Jacques
amidst their brethren. Once more they set out
with wallet and staff, through Brabant, past Louvain 
and Aachen, until they reached the ancient
city of Cologne on the Rhine, in January 1246.
The Dominican Schools of Philosophy and Theology
were founded therein by the German friars in the
year 1222. This ancient foundation, dedicated to
St. Mary Magdalene, consisting of an extensive
priory and church, stood in the Stolkgasse, hard by
the cathedral. It had risen into public as well as
domestic eminence owing to the teaching of that
prodigiously learned man, Albertus Magnus. He
belonged to the noble family of Bollstadt, from
Lavingen, in Bavarian Swabia; during ten years he
had studied at Padua, and won his first spurs as a
keen dialectician, before taking the Dominican
habit. Blessed Jordon of Saxony, the Master
<!--
26 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
General at the time, completely captivated him by
his masterful eloquence and holiness, received his
vows by St. Dominic's tomb in Bologna, and left
him there to complete the higher studies. Returning 
home to Germany, he acquired such a reputation for 
learning, notably in physical science, that
his contemporaries styled him <i>"Albert the Great,
the Universal Doctor</i>," and posterity has confirmed
the verdict.
[His marble effigy graces the Prince Consort Memorial
in London.]
The Belgian Chronicle has inscribed
his name in its Annals with this just encomium:
"Great in Magic
[that is, in Physics], 
greater in Philosophy, greatest
in Divinity". His published works in twenty-seven
folio volumes reveal his vast breadth of research, as
well as the depth of his acumen. Such was the
man marked out by God's Providence to be the
master of <i>"The Angel of the Schools"</i>. Albert was
in his fifty-second year, and Thomas just 20
years old, when first they met: little did either of
them suppose that the younger would eclipse the
elder, as the sunset in glory veils the star. All
notions of Albert having ever been mentally slow,
or styled "the dull Swabian novice," must be 
relegated to the pages of idle romance, for they are
utterly void of foundation.<p>

St. Thomas entered the schools of Albert, as a
gem to be cut by a cunning hand, but the fluent
genius in the rostrum utterly failed to comprehend
him: the truer genius seated below was pro<!--
HIS STUDIES AT COLOGNE AND PARIS. 27
-->nounced to be a dullard. Among his fellow students 
Thomas passed for a slow wit, however much
impressed they might be by his retirement and
application. Even Albert shared in the verdict,
until he received a rude awakening. Vet this
was the youth of whom Rodolph in his "Life of
Albertus Magnus" gives the just estimate in 
impassioned phrase: "Thomas hastened to Cologne
with the ardour of a thirsty stag which runs to
a fountain of pure water, there to receive from
Albert's hand the life-giving cup of wisdom, and to
slake therein the thirst which consumed him".
Among those novice-students, Germans, Italians,
French, were youths who afterwards shone in the
Church and in Universities as saints, cardinals, 
prelates, and professors: such were Ambrose of Sienna,
Ulrich of Engelbrecht, Thomas de Cantimpr&eacute;, and
many more. Modesty in expressing an opinion,
the attitude of rapt attention as a listener, in the
tall Neapolitan brother, above all, his profound
humility in shunning display, all led up to the 
common verdict that Thomas was stupid, so a name
was speedily found for him: it was <i>"the dumb
Sicilian ox"</i>. With them learning meant <i>wrangling:</i> 
with St. Thomas it was all thought. When
asked later on in life why he had been silent so
long at Cologne, he replied: "It was because I
had not yet learned to speak before such a mind as
Albert".<p>

A novice more charitable than his fellows offered
one day to help him in preparing the morrow's
<!--
28 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
lesson. The saint gratefully accepted the assistance; 
but when the would-be instructor got hopelessly 
involved in the argument Thomas came to 
his assistance and unravelled the tangle quite easily.
Some time after this Albert invited the scholars to
give him their views upon an obscure passage in
a book of itself obscure, the "Book of the Divine
Names," a fifth century work, but then uncritically 
ascribed to Denis the Areopagite. The outwitted
brother, who had floundered so helplessly in assisting 
Br. Thomas, now asked him to write down his
solution; this he did in candid simplicity. The
paper was delivered into Albert's hands, who at
once recognized the impress of a master mind,
so straightway he set him up at the lector's
desk to defend certain knotty questions which were
subjects of discussion at the time. Thomas explained 
the matter with such surprising clearness
and force that his auditory was amazed. Nor did he
handle with less skill the intricate objections raised
by the Bachelor, as he cut his way through with
keen distinctions. The objector then interposed
sharply: "You seem to forget that you are not a
master, to decide, but a disciple to learn how to
answer arguments raised". Then came the simple
rejoinder: "I don't see any other way of answering
the difficulty". Albert now interposed: "Very
well then, continue according to your method, but
remember that I have my objections to make";
whereupon he plied him with retorts, axioms transgressed, 
and sub-divisions of sub-distinctions, but
<!--
HIS STUDIES AT COLOGNE AND PARIS. 29
-->
Thomas never faltered for an instant. To each
thrust of argument advanced he had a ready parry
of a distinction, or of argument retorted in its 
utmost conclusions, for he was a swordsman of the
tongue, a very giant of dialectics. Albert could 
restrain himself no longer. "You call him 'a dumb
ox,' but I declare before you that he will yet bellow
so loud in doctrine that his voice will resound
through the whole world." He procured a cell for
him next to his own, allowed him to avail himself
of the results of his own laborious researches, and
made him the companion of his walks.<p>

The lesson was not lost upon the students, who,
while admiring his genius, still continued to twit
him with his simplicity. One day a novice observing 
him as he stood by the open window, called
out: "Look, look, there is an ox flying over the
convent". Thomas leant forth and gazed up, to
be greeted with laughter of derision; but the 
tormentor quailed before the rejoinder: "I was not so
simple as to believe that an ox could fly, but I
never imagined that a religious man could stoop to
falsehood". Many years afterwards a similar jest
drew forth the same rebuke, when asked -- "Could
you have believed that a fish could climb a tree?
St. Thomas was always extremely simple, but it was
the simplicity of the Gospel. At this early period
he launched forth on his first work, which was a
commentary on the Ethics of Aristotle.<p>

Six months were the limit of his first stay in
Cologne. The General Chapter of the order met
<!--
30 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
there at Pentecost decided to send Albert and
Thomas to Paris, the master to occupy a chair in
the University, which was then the foremost in the
world, the disciple to continue his studies under the
best possible advantages. The progress of this
scholar cannot be set forth better than in his own
axiom inculcated in the "Summa Theologica":<p>

<i>"Whatever is received by any subject is grasped
according to the subject's capacity"</i>. And his was a
genius which already bid fair to overtop Albertus
Magnus.<p>

During the month of August three Friars
Preachers might be seen journeying afoot from
the Rhine to the Seine: they were the Father-General, 
the master, the disciple : the Venerable
John, Blessed Albert, St. Thomas. Once arrived
in Paris, master and disciple resumed their places in
the Dominican schools, which were affiliated to the
University. Albert's reputation having preceded
him, he drew a vast concourse of students to his 
lectures; in time the assembly grew to be so vast that
no hall could accommodate the auditory, until by
compulsion he had to lecture in the open square.
Master Albert was outpaced in holiness and in
learning by his meteor disciple; but the Church
has beatified him, the world has acclaimed him as
the "Universal Doctor," who knew all that was to
be known. Daily on his knees he recited the entire
Psalter. His eminent piety has been attested to by
many, but let one witness suffice: it is the testimony 
of his disciple, Cardinal Thomas of Can<!--
HIS STUDIES AT COLOGNE AND PARIS. 31
-->timpr&eacute;: "After this ought it to astonish us that
Albert should be endowed with superhuman knowledge, and 
that his word should enflame the heart
more than that of other masters? We know now
from what source those transports of love proceeded,
which we see so frequently break out in his numerous 
writings." All the world owes him homage,
because he trained the soul as well as the mind of
St. Thomas.<p>

Whether the master commented, or examined in
the cloister school or elsewhere, Thomas was always
present, forming himself on the great model. At
this time he was engrossed in studying Aristotle's
Metaphysics, the "Sacra Pagina," or Holy Scriptures, 
and Patrology, for these entered into the
normal course of every scholastic; in his hours of
privacy in the cell he set himself to read and retain
in memory the voluminous writings of St. Augustine, 
the most learned of the doctors. To Thomas
the mind of Augustine was the mind of the Catholic
Church; upon him he based his opinions; his
authority was final. Posterity is indebted to St.
Thomas for a benefit so little known and recognized; 
after assimilating St. Augustine's works,
which usually extend to forty volumes in octavo,
he recast them in the terse and accurate speech of
the Schoolmen.<p>

Patrology is sacred science in its least scientific
presentment. The Holy Fathers had none of the
conciseness in form, none of the preciseness in 
terminology, which characterizes the thirteenth century
<!--
32 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
Schoolmen; they wrote with a fullness of diction
and laxity of expression which is often tedious and
sometimes misleading. The great Augustine is a
river whose fullness of waters gladdens the city of
God. The Fathers are the "Ponies," the Authorities, 
while the Schoolmen are but the Exponents;
the former define doctrine, the latter define form,
whereas "The Angel of the Schools" does both.
But it must not be overlooked that St. Thomas had
the Church's experience of eight centuries from the
age of St. Augustine, during which interval both
thought and speech were recast. Here in Paris he
was the reader, the thinker, the rememberer, but
still the disciple. To write and talk was reserved
for maturer days, when the coarse grain now passing 
through the mill of his mind would emerge as
the refined flour, to make the bread of doctrine.
What little he wrote was for his own purposes: his
hour had not yet come.<p>

Such studious occupations did not cause his
spirit of piety to relax. How often does the study
even of Divine things cause the wells to dry up! It
is to the student's hurt when the true inner spirit
gives way before the outer discipline of learning.
With the Dominicans, the novice remains such
until priesthood under the vigilant eye and candid
tongue of a novice master: forward youth, over
pert of speech, has to be kept under, and wilful
youth tamed; indolent nature must be jogged, and
all show of cleverness put down by timely, yea,
and untimely, snubbings. St. Thomas had ex<!--
HIS STUDIES AT COLOGNE AND PARIS. 33
-->perience of it in the novitiate at Paris. One day
as he was reading aloud at table, the voice of
reproval rang out sharp, correcting him for a false
quantity in latinity: now although the error was
not the novice's but the corrector's, the reader 
instantly adopted the amended prosody. When afterwards 
twitted with his want of spirit, he replied:
"It really matters little how a word is pronounced,
but it is of the utmost importance to practise
humility and obedience on every occasion."<p>

While in Paris he met among our brethren, the
Friars Minor, one to whom his soul leaped out in
friendship: this was the future Seraphic Doctor
St. Bonaventure, a student at the time. For a
parallel friendship one must go back to the days
of David. "And it came to pass . . . the soul
of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and
Jonathan loved him as his own soul" (I Kings
xviii. 1). Although they had entered religion
about the same time, Bonaventure was older than
Thomas by about four years. Their intimacy in
Paris extended over seven years, that is from 1246
to 1248, and again from 1252 to 2256. It is
sometimes stated that St. Thomas sat with his
friend as a student under Master Alexander de
Hales: that brilliant man, however, was dead
before Thomas's arrival.<p>

After two years spent in the schools of St.
Jacques, Brother Thomas was raised to the Subdiaconate, 
and his younger brother, Rayner of
Aquino, gave himself to the order in Naples. The
<!--
34 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
General Chapter which met in Paris in this year
confirmed the Ordinances made in the two previous
chapters, and erected four new formal colleges for
the higher studies in other University centres:
Oxford for England, Bologna for Northern Italy,
Cologne for Germany, and Montpellier for Provence. 
Master Albert was now designated Regent
for Cologne, with Thomas for Bachelor; so once
more they wended their way to the Rhine, while
Brother Thomas carried in his sack Aristotle's
writings and the Sentences of Peter Lombard.
On the road they halted at Louvain in Brabant,
passing some days in the priory and church of
Notre Dame aux Dominicains, on the Dyle: a relic
of this visit is still reverently treasured in the new
foundation there, the restored "Studium Generale"; 
it is the upper portion of the "pupitre,"
or lectern, from which St. Thomas sang the
epistle.<p>

As Bachelor he had charge of all the students:
it was his task to supervise their plan of study,
correct their essays, object severely in the daily
defensions, read with them in camera. As a professor 
he began some daily lectures on Philosophy
and the Sacred Scriptures, which were not restricted
to his fellow religious, but were addressed to a great
concourse of clerics as well. It may not be out of
place to give his letter of golden advice addressed
to a student, premising that it is not admitted as
genuine by some critics
<!--
HIS STUDIES AT COLOGNE AND PARIS. 35
--><p>

"My VERY DEAR (BROTHER).<p>

"Since you have asked me how you ought
to study in order to amass the treasures of 
knowledge, listen to the advice which I am going to
give you.<p>

"As a mere stripling, advance up the streams,
and do not all at once plunge into the deep: such
is my caution, and your lesson. I bid you to be
chary of speech, slower still in frequenting places
of talk: embrace purity of conscience, pray unceasingly, 
love to keep to your cell if you wish to
be admitted into the mystic wine-cellar. Show
yourself genial to all: pay no heed to other folk's
affairs: be not over-familiar with any person, because 
over-much familiarity breeds contempt, and
gives occasion to distraction from study.<p>

"On no account mix yourself up with the sayings
and the doings of persons in the outside world. Most
of all, avoid all useless visits, but try rather to walk
constantly in the footsteps of good and holy men.
Never mind from whom the lesson drops, but
commit to memory whatever useful advice may be
uttered. Give an account to yourself of your every
word and action: see that you understand what you
hear, and never leave a doubt unsolved: lay up all
you can in the storehouse of memory, as he does
who wants to fill a vase. 'Seek not the things
which are beyond thee'.<p>

"Following these ways, you will your whole life
long put forth and bear both branches and fruit in
<!--
36 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
the vineyard of the Lord of Sabaoth. If you take
these words to heart, you will attain your desire."<p>

This letter is unquestionably the reflex of his
own rule of conduct. No one could be more
affable, more courteous, yet at the same time it was
a principle with him to shun all needless visits; the
world might come to him, but he would not go out
to it. As the time drew near for him to be raised
to the sacred priesthood, he gave himself over to
more protracted prayer and watchings. Several
hours of the day, as well as part of the night, were
spent in attitude of adoration before the altar, often
sighing and weeping audibly as his soul melted with
devotion; the heat of love within was manifest
on the glowing countenance. At early morn the
brethren frequently found him like the angel guarding 
the sepulchre. The Archbishop of Cologne
raised him to the diaconate, and subsequently to
the priesthood. The prelate who had the privilege
of consecrating his holy hands was Conrad of 
Hochstaden, the princely and munificent Archbishop
who rebuilt the choir of the old Romariesque
Cathedral. The ordination took place in the year
1250. His attitude in celebrating the Divine mysteries 
upon the altar was one of majesty, and of
rapt devotion. William de Tocco, his pupil and
first biographer, describes what he was privileged
to witness daily: "When he consecrated in mass,
he was seized with such intensity of devotion as
to be dissolved in tears, utterly absorbed in its
mysteries, and nourished with its fruits".
<!--
HIS STUDIES AT COLOGNE AND PARIS. 37
--><p>

This year of gladness for him was one of dire
disaster for his family. His brothers left the service
of the Emperor Frederick II in consequence of his
hostility to the Pope, and took up arms in defence
of the Holy See. The enraged monarch thereupon
besieged Rocca Secca Castle, and all but demolished
it, put Raynald of Aquino to death, while the elder
brother, Landulf, who was now head of the family,
fell fighting in the cause of the Church. The
Countess Theodora, stricken with grief and years,
was forced into voluntary exile with her dependents,
and died soon after in sentiments of great piety.
St. Thomas heard of the ruin of his home and
family with his wonted calm, humbly accepting
God's inscrutable and adorable will.<p>

All knowledge is aptly distinguished into two
classes, which form the divisions of the holy 
doctor's writings. The distinction is his own: "The
knowledge of Divine things is termed Wisdom,
whereas the knowledge of human things is called
Science". His life henceforth may be generally
classified into two periods, each of twelve years;
as an expository writer he now started his <i>scientific 
period</i>, which was in 1262 commuted for the
<i>sapiential</i>.<p>

During this time at Cologne he composed his
first Opuscula, or lesser works. These were first
of all Aristotelian: first in order was the treatise
"On Being and Essence," then another on "The
Principles of Nature"; for his theological course
he wrote a "Commentary on the Sacred Scriptures,"
<!--
38 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
also a "Commentary on the Sentences of Peter
Lombard ". At the instance of Adelaide Duchess
of Brabant he drew up and sent her a treatise "On
the Government of the Jews," for it was a thorny
question of the day, as to how the Jews ought to be
treated by Christian rulers.<p>

From the day of his ordination the scholar came
forth as the preacher. In the churches of Cologne
and Bonn St. Thomas poured out his thoughts in
rich German speech to delighted auditories; he
was no utterer of platitudes or profundities, but an
orator who spoke to the heart and held men under
the spell of his sonorous eloquence. The great
German awakening to liberty, and letters, and
national prosperity, dated from 1250; their feudalism 
ended then, and a religious-minded people
thought and wrote for the first time no longer in
Latinity but in their own vigorous tongue. St.
Thomas caught the public ear by his well-reasoned
doctrinal sermons, which were listened to by Jews
and Christians alike. To quote from de Tocco
once more: "He was heard by the people as if
his discourse came from God". "A wholesome
tongue is a tree of life," as we read in Proverbs
xv. 4. We have grown so used to think of him as
the theologian teaching and writing that we are apt
to lose sight of the apostolic side of his life. Not
less an apostle in zeal than St. Dominic, he never
let an occasion of preaching go by; where hundreds 
heard him in the schools, thousands hung 
on his lips in the churches of Italy, France, and

Germany, for this versatile man could say with St.
Paul: "I give thanks to my God, for that I speak
in all your tongues" (1 Cor. xiv. 18).<p>

<hr><p>

<A NAME="IV"></a>

CHAPTER IV.<p>

HE GRADUATES AS DOCTOR.<p>

GREAT was the satisfaction of the scholars in Paris,
greater the joy of the brethren, when Thomas was
recalled thither as licentiate in 1252, with a view
to taking the doctorate. The holy friendship with
Bonaventure was resumed, and deepened. One
day he found his friend engaged in writing the life
of St. Francis of Assisi: loath to disturb him in his
devout task, he stole quietly away from the cell,
saying to his companion, "Let us leave a saint to
write about a saint".<p>

It was now a period of conflict between the city
and the University, owing to the slaying of a
student, coupled with the wounding and arrest of
three more, perpetrated by the city guard. Since
satisfaction was not forthcoming, the doctors closed
their schools: but the Dominican and Franciscan
professors continued to lecture as usual, having no
interest in the dispute. Such a proceeding gave
offence, so the University authorities passed a new
statute, that for the future no one should be 
admitted to the degree of Doctor in Theology unless
he swore to observe all the statutes, especially the
one just formulated. This simply meant that on
every occasion of a dispute between themselves and
<!--
40 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
the city, all lectures must cease until the matter
was settled. The Mendicant Orders stood out, and
refused to be so restricted. Why should soberminded 
men be reduced to silence by reason of the
night escapades of these young bloods! The disagreement 
lasted for over three years, while the
saintly friends kept their souls in peace, studying,
praying, and lecturing, as if there were no such
entities as doctors and proctors and city-bailiffs.
But when Friar Thomas Aquinas was duly presented by 
the Prior and Regent to stand for his 
degree, he was curtly set aside and the petition
refused. Feeling ran so high that he and Bonaventure 
were driven out of the schools with kicks
and hisses: such was the secularism of the age.
Pope Alexander IV sent a Brief ordering the University 
to admit him to the doctorate: the Senate
steadily refused to obey the mandate. Matters
stood at a deadlock, the outlook was becoming
serious, as the students forsook Paris for Oxford,
not in units but in shoals, while Thomas lectured
to the shrunken auditory of his brethren only.<p>

During this time, which was as peaceful to him as
it was distracting to others, he composed and issued
treatises "On Man," "On Eternity," "On Thought,"
"The Movement of the Heart," "Thirty-six Articles
in Reply to a Professor of Venice," "Explanation of
Two Decretals of Pope Innocent III," written for
the Archdeacon of Trent. The following, which
have been attributed to him, must however be 
considered as apocryphal: "Of Fate," "The Powers
<!--
HE GRADUATES AS DOCTOR. 41
-->
or the Soul," "The Difference between God's Word
and Man's Word," "The Essence and Dimensions
of Matter".<p>

There came a lull in the storm early in 1256,
since the Pope wrote to the Chancellor on 4 May,
congratulating him on permitting Friar Thomas
Aquinas to teach once more in public; but the
spirit of rancour was still abroad. As he was
preaching in St. Jacques' Church on Palm Sunday,
one of the University proctors, Guillot by name,
marched in and stopped his discourse, after which
he read aloud a letter from William de St. Amour
and the other doctors, full of acrimony against the
Mendicant Friars and the preacher in particular.
Thomas kept silent throughout, then calmly resumed 
his sermon. This William de St. Amour, a
name of ill-omened fame, had just completed a
work against the Mendicant Orders, entitled, "The
Perils of the Last Times". This was the gage of
battle thrown down by the doctors of Paris 
University. The French episcopate spoke out against
the infamous book, but coming as it did from such
high authority, the students and people accepted
its lying statements. At the instance of the King,
St. Louis IX, the Pope summoned both parties to
appear before him. The gage of battle thus 
recklessly thrown down was taken up by Thomas and
Bonaventure, while a commission of doctors represented 
the University: it was question now, not of
privilege, but of the very right of existence for
religious men.
<!--
42 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
Thomas proceeded straight to Rome on the summons 
of the Master General, Humbert de Romans,
who put the book into his hands to read and refute.
Against it he wrote his famous treatise, entitled,
"An Apology for the Religious Orders," basing it
upon the opening words of Psalm LXXXII.: "O
God, who shall be like unto Thee? Hold not Thy
peace, neither be Thou still, O God. For lo, Thine
enemies have made a noise: and they that hate
Thee have lifted up their head." He pronounced a
discourse before the General Chapter, in which he
broke out as follows: "Have no fear, my brethren,
for I have examined it, and find it to be captious,
perfidious, and erroneous". The mendicant apologists 
were Albert and Thomas on behalf of the
Friars Preachers, Bonaventure and another on behalf 
of the Friars Minor, besides other friars from
both orders; all appeared before Pope Alexander
IV in Anagni Cathedral, and read their confutations; 
as was to be expected, this silly and most
murderous work in its intent was condemned on
5 October, 1256. The apologies read that day
deserve the eternal gratitude of all the religious
orders: Paris reeled again under the blow smitten
by the hands of the Universal, the Seraphic, the
Angelic doctors, who vindicated the rights of holy
poverty.<p>

During this stay in Italy, St. Thomas confuted
another work of impiety and false mysticism, 
entitled "The Eternal Gospel". In November he
returned with Master Albert by sea to Marseilles.

HE GRADUATES AS DOCTOR. 43

During the early part of the voyage the weather
seemed promising: soon, however, a wild tempest
arose, which created panic in every breast but their
own. Like another Paul, the saint prayed, the lives
of the travellers and mariners were granted to his
prayers, and all reached the port in safety.<p>

Eleven Papal Briefs were sent out before the
Angel of the Schools was admitted to his degree in
October, 1257, in his thirty-third year. When the
time came his humility took alarm: vainly he
pleaded his unworthiness of such a dignity, or
that there were other brethren, his seniors, who
were more deserving of the doctorate. It required
the voice of a formal obedience to get him to
acquiesce, and this made him sad of heart.<p>

During the night preceding the academic Act
he was on his knees reciting the sixty-eighth Psalm,
seeking comfort from heaven, "Save me, O God,"
cried he, "for the waters are come in, even to my
soul!" then sleep overcame him, and he had this
vision: before him stood a religious of mature
years, wearing the habit of the order, who accosted 
him in gentle tones: "Why are you beseeching God 
thus earnestly, and in tears?" Then
Thomas answered him with all his natural sincerity: 
"It is on account of the burden of the
doctorate, for which my knowledge is insufficient,
likewise because I do not know which text to select 
as the burden of my discourse ". Then the
heavenly visitor continued: "Behold thou art
heard. Take the burden of the doctorate upon

thee, since God is with thee: choose for thy subject 
this text, and all will go well with thee: <i>'Thou
waterest the hills from Thy chambers above: the
earth shall be filled with the fruits of Thy works'</i>"
(Ps. clii. 13). Then he awoke and returned thanks
to God. Who else can the heavenly instructor
have been but the Apostolic Patriarch St. Dominic
himself?<p>

Early in the morning of the eventful day Thomas
awoke with swollen cheek, and scarce able to speak
from pangs of toothache; so he hied him to the
cell of his friend Father Reginald for counsel in his
misery. Reginald stood dumb with amazement at
the mishap. Did he suggest some old-time remedy?
Very likely he did, but Thomas hit upon a speedier
one. Falling on his knees he prayed mutely a while,
when to the cell floor fell the cause of the trouble,
the tooth with its biting fangs.<p>

It was on 23 October, 1257, that St. Thomas pronounced 
his oration in the hall of the Archbishop's
palace, based on the text revealed to him: "Thou
waterest the hills from Thy chambers above: the earth
shall be filled with the fruits of Thy works". His
theme was "The Majesty of Christ," and he spoke
as one inspired, before a hushed assembly. It was
as a scene rehearsed from the Book of Job (XXIX.):
"The young men saw me, and hid themselves: the
elders rose up and stood. The rulers ceased to
speak, and laid their finger on their mouth." He
applied his text to our Lord, who is King over
angels and men alike. Christ from His throne of 
<!--
HIS SYSTEM AND METHOD OF STUDY. 45
-->
majesty waters the mountains, which are the
heavenly spirits, the sublime intelligences, with the
torrents of His glory and light. He fills the Earth,
that is to say, the Church upon earth, with the fruits
of His works, through the Sacraments, which are the
channels whereby He communicates to men the
fruits of His Passion. After the oration he was
solemnly received with cap and ring as a Doctor of
Paris. There is an old tradition to the effect that
St. Bonaventure was promoted on the same day.
Some critics deny the fact,
["Acta S.S.", Tom. XXX  p. 809]
but what tradition is
there which has not been gainsaid~ On this occasion
arose the Only contention they ever had together.
Each from humility wished the other to take precedence, 
until Thomas gave way as being the younger.<p>

<i>"Post honores, labores." -- " To honours succeed labours"</i>.<p>

LIKE some well-laden tree, Thomas, moved by the
Spirit of Truth from on high, dropped the ripe fruits
of learning. St. Raymund of Pennafort, known
in history as <i>"The Master of the Decretals,"</i> after
resigning the rank of Master General of the Order of
Preachers, retired to Spain, where he exercised his
zeal in the conversion of the Jews and Moors.
<!--
46 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
What he needed most was a philosophic exposition
of Christian belief, to combat Arabian thought.
Aware of the newly risen star, he besought Father
Thomas in Paris to undertake the task. Writing
is preaching, when the pen is dipped in grace, and
is ever more enduring. So the holy Doctor responded 
to the appeal by commencing his first
monumental work, the "Summa Contra Gentiles,"
or, "The Sum of the Truth of Catholic Faith against
the Gentiles". 
[The exact date of completion of the "Summa Contra
Gentiles" appears to be 1261 (Ptol. Lucca, L, xxii, C. 23).]
Set forth in four books, it contains
a complete demonstration of Christian Truth against
false philosophies, demonstrating absolutely that
the dogmas of Christianity can never be opposed to 
right reason. Its success was immense,
and soon it was rendered out of Latin into
Greek, Syriac, and Hebrew, in order to be more
accessible to those against whose errors it was
composed. In European schools from 1261 it became a 
text-book of the philosophy of religion.
Next followed the mixed writings known as the
"Quodlibets," a collection in 160 Articles of
questions proposed with their solutions: some of
these questions were profound, others trivial, but all
throw a side-light on the scholastic subtilties of his
day. After this he put forth the <i>opusculum</i> of 104
articles upon "Truth," this he followed up by the
"Compendium of Theology". The masterly collection 
known as the "Questiones Disputatae" was
not written in any precise year: it is a compilation
<!--
HIS SYSTEM AND METHOD OF STUDY. 47
-->
made in 400 articles, comprising his answers to 
discussions arising out of his lectures, and extending
over twenty years. In his elaborated Commentary
on the Book of Job, he draws out admirably the
argument of God's Providence governing the world.<p>

The real presence of Christ in the Sacrament of the
Eucharist is a doctrine which cannot be denied 
without making shipwreck of the faith. By the term
real is meant an objective, substantial, abiding
presence: it proclaims the living Christ to be truly
in the Sacrament, <i>"Secundum rei Veritatem"</i>. This
doctrine is the very touchstone of Catholic belief,
the centre of Catholic devotion. But in the age of
St. Thomas, while all professed this faith, there were
conflicting opinions as to the manner of such presence. 
The Doctors of Paris were especially full of
this question, and now, after many fruitless disputes,
resolved to refer the matter to the Angelic Doctor,
since with him, to seize upon a difficulty was to unravel it.
For a time he withdrew to the solitude of his
cell to give himself up to prayer, then, under the
dictation of the Holy Spirit, he wrote a treatise, "Of
Substance and Accidents in the Eucharist,"
[The extant tractate is declared apocryphal by P&egrave;re 
Mandonnet, O.P. Des Ecrits authentiques de St. Thomas
d'Aquin Fribourg, 1910, p. 97.]
which he afterwards so pithily expressed in the "Lauda
Sion".<p>

<blockquote>
Here beneath these signs are hidden<br>
Priceless things to sense forbidden;<br>
 &nbsp; Signs, not things, are all we see.
</blockquote>
<!--
ST. THOMAS AQUINAS. 48
--><p>

After finishing the work he retired to the church,
where he placed it upon the altar, and thus addressed 
the crucifix: "Lord Jesus Christ, Who art
really present and workest wonders in this Sacrament, 
I humbly beg of Thee, that if what I have
written of Thee be true, Thou wilt say so: but if I
have written aught which is not conformable to the
faith, or contrary to this holy mystery, be pleased
to hinder me from proceeding farther". Fr. Reginald 
of Piperno and others who had followed him
saw our Blessed Lord appear, standing on the manuscript, 
and heard Him speak these words of approbation: "Thou 
hast written ably of the Sacrament
of My Body, and hast accurately determined the
difficulty proposed to thee, in so far as it can be
understood by man on earth, and be defined by
human wisdom". Then the spectators beheld the
holy man uplifted miraculously from the ground, as
if drawn heavenwards by the fervour of his devotion.
From that day the University looked upon him not
merely as a genius of thought, but as a man sent of
God. According to the statutes the Master must
retire on the expiry of one year, and Thomas complied; 
but so keen was the sense of loss, that after
a few months he was invited to resume his course.<p>

St. Louis IX, King of France, held his relative
Thomas Aquinas in the highest esteem, and made
him a member of his Privy Council for State Affairs.
It was his wont to inform the holy Doctor the 
evening before of all important business to be discussed
on the morrow, so that he might come prepared to
<!--
HIS SYSTEM AND METHOD OF STUDY. 49
-->
tender advice. One is not surprised to find these
years synchronize with the monarch's greatest temporal 
glory, opening an epoch of lasting benefit to
France. He excused himself as often as he could
with propriety from sitting at the royal table, but
whether at Council board or supper, he was as
recollected as in his cell. While sitting at table one
evening with the King and Queen and guests, he
was observed to be quite lost in thought. Vainly
the Prior plucked his sleeve to arouse him, when
suddenly the goblets and platters jumped from a
blow of his fist on the trencher, and the sonorous
voice rang out: "The argument is clinched against
the Manichees!" All the while his train of thought
had been of the heresy of the new Manichees, the
Vaudois, and Cathari. The Prior rebuked him for
such unseemly conduct, but the gentle Louis only
smiled, and bade one of his secretaries write down
the argument hastily, lest it might lose its force and
clearness. The King furthermore employed him
and Fr. Vincent de Beauvais, author of "The Threefold 
Mirror," in arranging the royal library of rare
manuscripts. Often might the spectacle be seen of
the saintly King sitting as a rapt listener, while the
great Doctor, now a man of commanding stature
and build, poured out his eloquence within the
walls of Notre Dame, or of St. Jacques. A fairer sight
it was to behold Thomas humbly serving at Mass
in the conventual church, or making the rough ways
plain to novices in logic.<p>

In the General Chapter assembled at Valen<!--
50 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->ciennes during Pentecost of 1259, he sat on the
Commission for Studies, together with Masters
Albert, Vincent de Beauvais, Peter de Tarentaise,
[Afterwards Pope Innocent V.]
Buonomo, and Florence, all of them Doctors of
Paris. It was their task to draw up a <i>Norma
Studiorum</i>, or fixed programme of higher studies,
to be employed in all colleges of the order; the
Ordinances then prescribed may be found in the
Chapter Acts.
[ "Reichart Acta Capitulorum Generalium," 1898, 1. 99;
cf. Denifle "Chartularium," Paris, 1889, I. B. 385, etc.,
n. 335.]
From thence he returned to Paris
for two more years, lecturing and writing as before.
In the schools his deportment and spirit reminded
the listeners of the mildness and modesty of Christ;
never ruffled, never heated in argument, utterly devoid 
of pretence or display, he kept to his childlike
way of holy simplicity. St. John Chrysostom in his
"Sixty-second Homily on St. Matthew's Gospel,"
makes this deep observation, and St. Thomas certainly 
lived up to it: "The full measure of philosophy is 
to be simple, with prudence: such is an
angelic life ". Once when he was examining a
candidate for the Licentiate, the cleric hazarded
a thesis savouring of unorthodoxy; Thomas gently
reproved the line of argument taken, and pointed
out its fatal consequences, but with rare delicacy.
When blamed for not at once confuting the error,
he rejoined: "I did not wish to put him to shame
before such a distinguished auditory, but to-morrow
<!--
HIS SYSTEM AND METHOD OF STUDY. 51
-->
I will convince him of his mistake". Next day
came the final defension in the Archbishop's palace,
when the same opinion was advanced with emboldened 
insolence. Then the holy Doctor calmly
objected by accepting the thesis, but with pitiless
logic forced the candidate to draw out his argument
to its ultimate conclusions which he had to admit
were heretical and untenable. The defendant saw
his error, withdrewt the thesis, and apologized for
the offensive manner assumed. The saint then administered
a correction quite after his own fashion:
"Ah, now you speak sound doctrine, as a true
teacher should ".<p>

How did St. Thomas study? What was his
method in writing? We gather it from the lips of
his inseparable secretary and confessor and confidant, 
Fr. Reginald of Piperno. Before studying or
lecturing he prayed much, distrusting his great
natural gifts: when writing or dictating he would
frequently rise and stand a while before the crucifix: 
at times he would withdraw to the altar where
the adorable Sacrament reposed, and, leaning upon
the altar table, or with head pressed against the
Tabernacle door, collect his thoughts as he sought
for light. During the composition of his Apology
for the Faith, the "Summa Contra Gentiles," he
was often seen in rapture. The Vatican Library
contains among its other treasures a genuine 
autograph copy, on whose margins he occasionally
wrote the words <i>"Ave Maria"</i>.<p>

Genius is twofold: it may be the dower of rare
<!--
52 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
mental parts, but more commonly it is the faculty
of taking pains over work, the art of constructiveness: 
and St. Thomas shone in both. He took
the greatest pains in forecasting his scheme, dividing 
and subdividing, after which he built up each
portion in a separate article. There is an old adage
in the schools: --<p>

<blockquote>
Sanctus Doctor est doctrina simul et disciplina.<br>
(The Holy Doctor is both doctrine and discipline.)
</blockquote><p>

From him the scholar can learn science and method.
"He did all things well," as was said of our Lord.
Employing both methods, analytic and synthesis, his
aim was to construct each work on the basis of a
vast synthesis. Of course this does not hold good
of his Commentaries, where the purpose is all critical
and expository. Nor does it apply to the "Catena
Aurea," which is simply the stringing together of
quotations from the Fathers: but even here one
marvels at the acumen shown in the fitness of the
passages culled from each, like a handful from a
meadow.<p>

The beauty of his writings lies in four cardinal
points: Sublimity of thought, Subtilty of argument,
Simplicity of style, Unction of spirit. Above all
things he is logical in sequel. No one can presume
to abridge him without losing the charm of his
rare diction: wilfully to excise an argument, 
especially one which he calls "a first and more obvious
one," such as the proof of God's existence drawn
from motion, is the freedom of a pigmy towards a
giant. The best model for the Christian apologist
<!--
HIS SYSTEM AND METHOD OF STUDY. 53
-->
to follow is his "Sum of the Truth of Catholic
Faith against the Gentiles". His attitude towards
the princes of the ancients, Plato and Aristotle, is
always one of reverence: 
[For question of the Church's supposed condemnation
of Aristotle's Philosophy see " Siger de Brabant," by Pierre
Mandonnet, O.P., Louvain, 1911.]
towards the leaders of the
Arabian school he is more hostile, since their influence 
threatened to undermine Christian thought:
hence all his destructive weapons were brought to
bear upon Avicenna (1037), Avicebron (1070), and
Averroes (1198). His philosophy is Aristotelian
throughout, but refined and purified by the light of
revelation: with all the elevation of Plato, he does
not disdain at times to use the Socratic method. A
master of analysis, he furnishes us with many an
example of clear thought. Take for instance his
treatise on the Incarnation of our Blessed Lord,
which he disposes of in fifty-nine questions: it is all
resumed under four headings: <i>Ingressus</i>, His birth;
<i>Progressus</i>, His mission; <i>Regressus</i>, His passion and
death; <i>Exaltatio</i>, His ascension and headship.<p>

No one need ever hope to understand St. Thomas
who is not well grounded in Scholastic Philosophy:
mere knowledge of latinity will not suffice. The
student must attend to the holy Doctor's method of
constructiveness, as exhibited in every article. He
first submits his proposition: as for instance -- 
"Whether Grace be a quality of the soul". Then
he opens out with arguments to the contrary, 
varying from two to twenty, but commonly three in
<!--
54 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
number: these objections are drawn either from
reason or authority, and such authority is either of
Sacred Scripture, the Fathers, or the Philosophers.
After apparently demolishing the proposition, he
opens out his own line of argument by a "Sed
Contra", or, "But on the contrary". In the body
of the article he constructs the proof by solid 
arguments well reasoned out: frequently he adopts the
historic method, narrating the opinions of past
schools of thought, and demolishing each as he
proceeds: finally he lays down the conclusion as
established by irrefragable argument. All this is
constructive method: now he passes to the destructive. 
Each objection proposed at the outset is
weighed, distinguished, dismissed. The Scholastic
rule of debate is this: "Never admit, seldom deny,
always distinguish". All are not Thomists who read
St. Thomas: Thomism is consistency with the principles 
and conclusions of the Master.<p>

Great was the consternation and grief of Paris
when the newly elected Pontiff, Urban IV, summoned 
St. Thomas to Rome. For four years now,
from 1261 to 1265, he was a stranger to the public
schools: Universities vainly petitioned for his 
services, but the Pope would have him close by his
side. Although never made Master of the Sacred
Palace, he was set over the school of select scholars,
and resided with them in the Lateran Palace. Urban IV 
was a promoter of learning, and insisted on
the staff and students following him in all his 
journeys and residences through Italy: thus it came
<!--
HIS SYSTEM AND METHOD OF STUDY. 55
-->
about that during five years Thomas held his "prelections," 
as they were termed, in Rome, Viterbo,
Fondi, Orvieto, Anagni, Perugia, and Bologna, He
was now a member of the papal household, a Consultor 
of the Holy Father, a teacher of the coming
princes and bishops of the Church: at the same
time he gave himself to preaching in these towns,
to the great profit of souls. The uppermost thought
in Urban's mind was the reunion of East with West,
since the Eastern Church was unfortunately severed
by heresy and schism. The Greek Church had
stood aloof for ages from the centre of unity, the
Chair of Peter, in a state of stagnation as to 
learning and sanctity. Christ's prayer for unity wrung
the Pontiff's soul; so he opened his mind to the
Angelic Doctor. The zeal of the one and the learning 
of the other ought surely to accomplish our
Lord's desire: "Grant, Father, that they may be one,
even as Thou and I are one" (St. John, xvii. 22).
According to St. Thomas, schism is a most grievous
crime, as destroying the Church's Unity, and setting
up many folds and shepherds. Figuratively speaking, 
the Lord's seamless garment is rent: with such
a conviction in mind, this loyal son of the Church
set himself to repair it with the silver threads of
argument and the golden of charity. At the bidding 
of Urban IV he composed a work entitled
"Against the Errors of the Greeks". The Pope
sent the book to Michael Paleologus, the eighth
Emperor of Constantinople: soon it was turned
into the Greek tongue, and copies multiplied, which
<!--
56 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
found their way into many hands. He followed it
up with another work undertaken at the request of
the Precentor of Antioch: "Against the Errors of the
Greeks, Armenians, and Saracens". In this treatise
he draws out in masterly fashion the Generation of
the Eternal Word, the Procession of the Holy Ghost,
the motive of the Incarnation, how the faithful receive 
the Body of Christ, Purgatory for expiation,
the Beatific Vision in heaven, and lastly, how 
Predestination imposes no necessity on man's free-will.
Our saint did not live to see the realization of his
hopes, but he sowed the good seed which resulted
in the harvest garnered in at the General Council of
Florence, when the decree of union was pronounced.<p>

Quite a year went by from St. Thomas's coming
to Rome before the Pope removed his Court to
Viterbo; d4ring this interval he interpreted Aristotle
to the students in the Lateran Palace. It was in
Viterbo that he completed his second Commentary
on the Sacred Scriptures: its method is quite
different from the first: in the latter he bases his
views upon Tradition, whereas in the former he
relied upon the revealed letter itself. When these
are employed side by side, they form a component
harmony of the written word. The one aim of his
life was to pursue and to impart knowledge. Daniel
d'Augusta put the question to him one day, as to
what he considered to be the greatest gift he had
ever received, apart from sanctifying grace: with
candour of soul he replied that it was the gift of
understanding all that he had ever read. To inti<!--
HIS SYSTEM AND METHOD OF STUDY. 57
-->mate friends he disclosed the secret of his marvellous
wisdom, telling them that he learned more by prayer
than from study. This is the prayer which he invariably 
made before lecturing or writing, or studying<p>

"Creator, beyond human utterance, Who out of
Thy wisdom's treasures didst establish three hierarchies 
of Angels, setting them in wonderful order
to preside over the empyrean heaven, and Who hast
most marvellously assorted the parts of the universe;
Thou Who art called the fountain-head of life and
of wisdom, and the one over-ruling principle; be
pleased to shed the ray of Thy brightness over the
gloom of my understanding, so as to dispel the
double shadow of sin and ignorance in which I was
born. Thou Who makest eloquent the tongues of
babes, instruct my tongue, and shed the grace of
Thy blessing upon my lips. Bestow on me keenness
of wit to understand, the power of a retentive
memory, method and ease of learning, subtilty for
explaining, and the gift of ready speech. Teach
me as I begin, direct me as I advance, complete my
finished task for me, Thou Who art truly Godand man,
Who livest and reignest for ever and ever. Amen."<p>

The fortieth General Chapter of the Order met
in London in the year 1263, at Pentecost. We
are told that 300 brethren took part in it, in the
priory which stood in Holborn, which, on the testimony 
of Matthew Paris, was previously "the noble
residence" of the Earl of Kent. King Henry III
gave them a cordial welcome, assisted at the opening 
ceremony, and, as the Garde-robe Accounts
<!-- 
58 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
testify, gave a new habit to every friar present; this
was by no means a superfluous gift, considering
that all had come on foot, and many from remote
quarters of Europe. The Chapter was presided
over by the Venerable Humbert de Romans, fifth
Master-General, who, after nine years of government, 
now laid down his office owing to infirmities.
The resignation came as a surprise, and was accepted 
with regret, but since the Chapter was not
an elective one, no more could be done than choose
a Vicar-General for the ensuing year. Master
Albertus Magnus was the one selected, and took
up office. It was an eminent Chapter, if only from
men of eminence who took part in it. St. Thomas
was there, also Blessed Albertus Magnus, Peter
de Tarentaise, better known now as Blessed
Innocent V, Peter de Luca, the Roman Definitor, 
all the Provincials of the order with
their companions, the Masters from Paris, David
de Ayr, the Vicar-General of Scotland, and
the Vicar from Ireland, some forty definitors,
and the professors from Oxford. The fact of St.
Thomas's presence is not attested by contemporary
writers, but by later ones, who set forth many
authentic details of his life corroborated from other
sources. This need occasion no surprise, since the
scope and purpose of the first biographers was to
establish the sanctity and miracles of the Angelic
Doctor, as set forth by the Commissions. He
would have sailed from a French port in a schaloupe,
and landed at Deal, from whence a short journey
<!--
HIS SYSTEM AND METHOD OF STUDY. 59
-->
would bring him to his brethren in Canterbury.
From Canterbury to Rochester would form the
second stage: then on the close of the third day
he would be crossing Old London Bridge. There
was an affinity between King Henry Plantagenet
and Thomas of Aquino, although a remote one,
since each sprang from the Princes of Normandy.
Two main points occupy the attention of every
Chapter: these are regular observance and study.
During the great intellectual development of the
thirteenth century, the question of the Schools was
paramount; the nomination of Masters in Theology
to the greater centres of teaching, the assigning of
scholars who were to read in the various faculties,
the enforcing or modifying of the <i>Norma Studiorum</i>,
all these had to be discussed, and the results published. 
The aim of those first Dominicans, whose motto has 
ever been <i>Veritas</i>, or <i>Truth</i>, was not to
keep abreast of the times, but to go beyond them,
to lead, and progress beyond the Sentences of Peter
Lombard in divinity, and glosses upon Aristotle.
Most of all they sought to specialize. Thus at
this very time three hundred of them were engaged
under Cardinal Hugh de St. Cher in compiling the
first Biblical Concordance, while St. Raymund of
Pennafort was compiling his Five Books of Decretals, 
and others were establishing centres for the
study of Oriental languages. Their halls in St.
Edward's Schools at Oxford had been open now
just forty years, and to these many of the disaffected
scholars from Paris flocked. The condition of this
<!--
60 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
General House of Studies, enjoying the privileges
of a University, would certainly form a subject for
protracted discussion. On the conclusion of the
Chapter, St. Thomas returned to Viterbo by way of
Paris and Milan. In this latter city he prayed for
some days before the tomb of his holy brother in 
religion, St. Peter of Verona, the Martyr, in whose
honour a magnificent shrine had just been erected
over his remains in the church of the order, San
Eustorgio. At the request of the pious donors, he
then composed the still extant epitaph<p>

<blockquote>
Proeco, lucerna, pugil, Christi, populi, fideique, etc.
</blockquote><p>

St. Thomas was Poet as well as Theologian: his
"Summa Theologica" is one vast epic, while his
poems are all of them devout and couched in sweet
flowing numbers: and right well he sang of the
object dearest to his soul, Christ veiled in the
Eucharist. The office composed for the festival of
Corpus Christi is the rhapsody of a poet inspired
by faith and devotion; that he wrote it is due to a
command received by Pope Urban IV, whom he
petitioned to establish a special feast to be known
as Corpus Christi's. The thought was by no means
his own, for the honour falls to three holy virgins
of Belgium, the Blessed Julienne, Prioress of Mont
Cornillon, Eve, the recluse by Liege, and Isabel
of Huy. Stirred by a vision of the saints petitioning 
our Lord to establish such a festival in His
Church, they consulted a devout Canon of Li&eacute;ge,
John de Lausanne, who warmly approved of their
design, and wrote the original Office of the Blessed

Sacrament. This good priest furthermore laid the
scheme before Urban in the days when he was
simply Archdeacon of St. Lambert in Li&eacute;ge, as
well as before the Dominican Provincial, Hugh de
St. Cher, besides consulting with Guy de Laon,
Bishop of Cambrai, and three Dominican theologians, 
John, Giles, and Gerard. Now that the
Archdeacon was seated on the throne of the Fisherman, 
he acceded to the prayers of these devout
souls, and commissioned "his own Doctor," as he
termed him, to compose a new office for the festival 
of Corpus Christi. Approaching this work in
the spirit of reverent criticism, one is forced to
pronounce it a marvel of poetic vein, tenderest
thought and sublime doctrine. Dipping his pen
as it were into his very heart, he wrote as one 
inspired; where all is beautiful, one is particularly
struck with its doctrinal accuracy. Thus, in the
Antiphon for the Second Vespers, he sets forth 
admirably the fourfold purpose of the Eucharist.<p>

<blockquote>
O Sacred Banquet! wherein<br>
(1) The Christ is received,<br>
(2) The memory of His Passion recalled,<br>
(3) The Soul is filled with grace, and<br>
(4) A pledge of future glory given to us.

The language of theology is didactic, but in
the sequence, the <i>Lauda Sion Salvatorem</i>, he sings
even while he defines, like some bell-mouthed
Seraph strayed from heaven. With the year 1264
closes his Noon-tide of life. The morning star's
lustre has given place to the light of the full noon.<p>
