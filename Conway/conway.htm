PREFACE.<p>

"GOD is wonderful in His saints" (Ps. LXVII.
36). A saint's life is one of God's most
wonderful products, because it is the development 
of the Divine life within the natural
man, and in no common measure.<p>

Saintliness is the heroism of goodness, or
holiness risen to perfection, making its 
subject to be within and without a man of God.
But besides the common perfection which
comes of grace, there is stamped on each of
God's servants some special feature of the
Divine attributes, and this forms the genius
of the individual. In St. Thomas Aquinas
it is Divine Truth which shines forth within
and without, in the lustre of learning and
teaching, so that the words of the Psalmist
are verified in his life: "Thou hast laid bare
to me the deep and hidden things of Thy
Wisdom" (Ps. L. 7). He was the hive of
the world's honey of all ages.
<!--
viii PREFACE.
--><p>

Years are but as a day with God, hence,
a gracious life may be presented for our
contemplation as He evolved it, in its periods
of Morn, and Noon, and Evening, followed
by the Night, when after toil it passed into
glory. This memoir is based on the accounts
left by two of the saint's brethren, once his
disciples, William de Tocco and Ptolomeo
de Lucca, who to their personal witness added
the Reports of the Commissions held by three
Cardinals in Rome, and by the Archbishops
of Naples and Capua, and the Bishop of
Viterbo in their respective dioceses, on the
holy doctor's decease. Further details have
been gleaned from the pages of P&egrave;re Touron,
"Vie de Saint Thomas d'Aquin," issued in
quarto in 1741 ; also from materials supplied
in the life of Blessed Albert, who was the
saint's chief teacher.<p>

Such a biography is especially opportune
in our day, on the revival of scholastic learning
in the domains of Philosophy and Theology,
of which St. Thomas was the highest exponent, 
while he stands supreme as the patron
of the Christian Schools.
