PART IV: THE NIGHT OF REST.<p>

"And night shall be my light in the fullness of
my delights." -- Psalm cxxxviii, 11<p>


CHAPTER IX.<p>

MIRACLES AND CANONIZATION<p>

THE holy body was reverently carried beyond the
cloister for the consolation of the Countess 
Francesca and female friends, after which it was laid
out in the choir, with the face exposed. A great
concourse of the faithful flocked to tbe church;
such as were not permitted to enter the chancel
touched the coffin with olive branches, which
they kept as relics. The Requiem Mass was sung
by the Bishop of Terracina, who was a Franciscan,
in the presence of the Abbot and Cistercians, the
Friars Preachers and Friars Minor. Fr. Reginald 
of Piperno pronounced the funeral discourse, 
broken with sobs, as he removed the veil
which had concealed a life of consummate holiness.
At its conclusion he made formal protest that he
<!--
104 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
only left the body until further arrangements should
be made by the Master General of the Order.
Then, amid a universal wail, the earthly shrine of
Thomas Aquinas was removed, and buried in a
vault under the high altar. When tidings of his
death reached Lyons, the Pope and Cardinals were
filled with profound grief; the Holy Father ordered
his treatise "Against the Errors of the Greeks" to
be sent on to the Council. The saying of Eliphaz,
recorded in Job v. 26, was realized in St. Thomas.
<i>"Thou shalt enter into the grave in abundance, as a
sheaf of wheat which is brought in its season"</i>.<p>

The Cistercians of Fossa Nuova saw a great
light over the Abbey for three days, which passed
away at his death. The same marvel was beheld
over the Dominican priory at Cologne. At the 
moment of his death one of the Cistercians engaged
in prayer in the Abbey church saw St. Thomas's
soul mount to heaven like a radiant star.<p>

At the same moment Master Albert in Cologne
turned to Fr. Albert of Brescia, exclaiming with
tears: "My son in Christ, Thomas of Aquino,
the light of the Church, is dead, as God has 
revealed to me. He was the world's flower and
glory, and has rendered superfluous the writings of
Doctors who shall come after him."<p>

At Anagni, Fr. Raymund Maturi, while asleep
a few nights after this, had a vision in which he
saw St. Thomas, duly vested, proceed to the altar
and say mass. What struck him as singular was
the fact that his right eye appeared to be larger than
<!--
MIRACLES AND CANONIZATION. 105
-->
the other. The saint explained the wonder, with
these words: "My son, the knowledge which I
enjoy in heaven is greater than what I had on earth,
just as my right eye is greater than my left one".<p>

Fr. Paul of Aquila beheld this vision while praying 
in the church of San Domenico at Naples. He
saw Thomas seated in his professorial chair, teaching
a crowd of disciples. Presently St. Paul appeared
with a number of the saints, who conversed 
familiarly with him. He distinctly heard Thomas
ask St. Paul if he had rightly interpreted his Epistles,
whereat the Apostle replied: "Yes, so far as anyone 
in the mortal body can understand them; but
come away with me, and I will conduct you to a
place where you will have clearer understanding
of all things". Then grasping the holy Doctor by
his cloak, St. Paul led him away. Then Fr. Paul
shouted aloud: "Alas! Alas! Alas! our Doctor
is taken from us!"<p>

Fr. Albert of Brescia, a professor at Cologne,
poured out many and frequent prayers, especially
to the Blessed Virgin and to St. Augustine, that he
might ascertain the Angelic Doctor's degree of glory.
As he was kneeling before the altar, he beheld two
figures before him, one wearing a Mitre, and the
other clad in the Dominican habit: they were St.
Augustine of Hippo and Fr. Thomas Aquinas. St.
Thomas's habit was resplendent with precious stones,
while on his head he bore a crown of gold and
diamonds. From his neck there hung two chains,
one of gold and one of silver; on his breast was a
<!--
106 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
large carbuncle stone flashing rays of light like a sun.
Then the figure with the mitre addressed him.
"Why are you astonished, Fr. Albert? God has
heard your prayer. I declare to you that I am
Augustine, a Doctor of the Church, sent to acquaint
you of the glory of Thomas Aquinas, who is reigning 
with me. He is my son, because he followed
the teaching of the Apostle, and my own, and he
has illumined the Church with his learning. This
is signified by the precious stones with which he is
adorned. The shining jewel on his breast denotes
the uprightness of intention with which he defended
and proclaimed the Faith: the other jewels represent
the books and writings of all kinds which he composed. 
Thomas is my equal in glory, but surpasses
me by the aureola of Virginity."<p>

Eleutherius, a Franciscan theologian of repute,
was also favoured with a vision. He beheld the
Mother of God seated in glory, while beneath stood
St. Francis with St. Thomas, whose cappa was
studded with stars. Pointing to St. Thomas, the
Seraphic Father spoke thus to Eleutherius: "Confide 
in this man, for his teaching shall never pass
away."<p>

God revealed the saint's glory by very many
miracles, ninety-six of which were duly attested,
and submitted as evidence for his canonization.
While his body lay exposed in the Abbey Choir,
the Subprior, John de Ferentino, who was completely 
blind, placed his eyes against those of the
saint, and instantly saw. The holy Doctor's cell in
<!--
MIRACLES AND CANONIZATION. 107
-->
Naples became a resort of pilgrims, one of whom,
the renowned Egidius Romanus, uttered the phrase:
"I am come to adore in the place where his feet
have stood". Master Albert of Cologne could
never hear his name mentioned without breaking
into tears. Learning that his doctrine was impugned 
in Paris, although over 80 years of age, he
proceeded thither on foot with Hugh de Lucca in
1276, and defended St. Thomas's teaching warmly
before the University. "What a glory it is," he
exclaimed, "for the living to be praised by the
dead!" After representing the saint as being endowed 
with life while all others were covered with
the shades of death, he poured forth a splendid
eulogy of his doctrines as resplendent with orthodoxy 
and piety, and declared himself ready to meet
any opponent. He did the same at Cologne, declaring 
that by his writings Thomas had laboured
for all to the end of time.<p>

Owing to the pressure of Church affairs of graver
importance, little beyond collecting of evidence
was done towards the canonization under the brief
pontificates of the Dominican Popes, Blessed 
Innocent V, and Blessed Benedict XI. Innocent
spoke of him in terms of no common praise: "The
teaching of this Doctor beyond all others has fitness
of terms, manner of expression, and soundness of
opinions; so that he who holds it will never swerve
from the path of truth: while, on the contrary, he
who attacks it must always be suspected". Benedict
invariably styled him: "My Master; my Doctor".
<!--
108 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
--><p>

The solemn process of canonization was begun
in 1318, promoted by Robert, King of Sicily, and
supported by petitions from the Universities, the
hierarchy, clergy, and the Order of Preachers. The
official testimonies to be presented to the Pope
at Avignon were entrusted to Friars William de
Tocco and Robert de Benevento; as they were
proceeding to France by sea, a great storm arose,
and the ship was being carried towards the rocks,
when they prayed aloud to St. Thomas to preserve
them; the wind then veered round, and they
reached land safely. On delivering up the 
documents, Pope John XXII accepted them eagerly,
and thus addressed the prelates and friars: "We
do not doubt that Br. Thomas is already glorious
in heaven, his life having been saintly, and his
doctrine miraculous". Three days later, in 
Consistory, he again reverted to it. "Venerable
Brethren: We deem it a great glory for ourselves
and for the whole Church, to inscribe this servant
of God in the catalogue of the saints." The decree
was then read introducing the cause of canonization, 
and three prelates appointed as Commissioners
to examine the evidence of miracles; these were
Humbert, Archbishop of Naples; Angelo, Bishop
of Viterbo, and Pandulf, an Apostolic Notary.
Heaven now aided the cause by striking miracles.
The Archbishop of Naples was suffering from an
incurable ulcer: he now commended himself to
the saint's intercession before retiring to rest, and
in the morning it was gone, leaving only a red
<!--
MIRACLES AND CANONIZATION. 109
-->
mark. The Bishop of Viterbo fell ill of a violent
fever, and lay at the point of death: he also
prayed with confidence to the Angelic Doctor,
slept peacefully, and awoke in perfect health. The
same thing happened to Matthew, the chaplain of
the Archbishop of Naples. Two further Commissions 
sat, at Naples and at Fossa Nuova, to substantiate 
the evidence of miracles. While these
reports were being examined at Avignon, another
singular miracle was wrought by the saint's 
intercession. Mary d'Arnaud, the Pope's niece, lay at
the point of death from dropsy, so the Holy Father
sent her the last blessing by the Bishop of Lodevi.
It so chanced that the Bishop was a Dominican,
who recommended her to have recourse to St.
Thomas. She did so fervently, and during the
night saw some one draw nigh to her bed, whom
she took to be the Bishop. "Do you wish to be
cured?" asked the visitor. "I am not the Bishop,
but Brother Thomas Aquinas, to whom you have
had recourse: fulfil the vow you have made, and
you will recover." In the morning she found 
herself in perfect health.<p>

Three Dominican Cardinals completed the final
stages of the process with zeal and fervour: these
were Nicholas Aubertin, Nicholas de Freauville,
and William de Godieu.<p>

The day appointed for St. Thomas's canonization 
was 18 July, 1323. The preliminary ceremony 
began in the Dominican Church in Avignon
on the day before, in the presence of Pope John
<!--
110 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
XXII, the Cardinals, very many Archbishops and
Bishops, King Robert of Sicily, his mother Queen
Mary, many princes, nobles, and ambassadors.
The Pope pronounced a grand eulogium of the
saint's works and merits, grounded on this text:
<i>"This is a day of good tidings: if we hold our peace,
and do not tell it to the morning, we shall be charged
with crime: come, let us go and tell it in the King's
court"</i> (4 Kings vii. 9).<p>

King Robert of Sicily, a relative of the saint,
then gave an address, showing how St. Thomas
had merited the honour bestowed, because he had
been, and would ever continue to be, <i>"a burning
and a shining light"</i> (St. John V. 35).<p>

The Archbishop of Capua followed with a panegyric, 
who was succeeded by Fr. Raymund Bequin,
the Master of the Sacred Palace; further orations
were delivered by the Archbishop of Arles, the
Bishops of London, Winchester, and others.<p>

On the morning of 18 July the Pope had the
Bull of canonization read, assigning 7 March for
the feast, after which he sang the votive mass of
St. Thomas in the Cathedral of Notre Dame des
Doms, and pronounced another eulogium. "His
doctrine was not other than miraculous," cried the
Pontiff. "He has enlightened the Church more
than all other Doctors, and more profit can be
gained in a single year by the study of his works,
than by devoting a lifetime to that of other 
theologians. He has wrought as many miracles as he
has written Articles."

CHAPTER X.<p>

TRANSLATIONS OF HIS RELICS.<p>

FROM the day of his departure, petitions were 
addressed to the Holy See for the privilege of
possessing his incorrupt body: the King of Sicily
and the Counts of Aquino and San Severino did so
by title of kinship, the Universities of Paris and
Naples by reason of his services rendered in life,
and his own Order by right of sonship. The Cistercians 
of Fossa Nuova, however, kept their treasure 
for close upon a century; since their church
had become a sanctuary renowned for miracles,
they refused to part with what Providence had sent
them.<p>

In October, 1274, Abbot James and two monks
secretly removed the body to St. Stephen's Chapel
in the cloister, for which the saint rebuked them
in a dream: incautiously they opened the coffin,
whereupon a marvellous perfume exhaled which
penetrated the cells and church, and the deceit
practised was exposed. All saw him as if but 
reposing in sleep: as they carried him back to the
church a marvellous light shone around. Abbot
Peter translated the body to a befitting tomb in the
choir in 1279, situated on the Gospel side of the
high altar. The right hand, still perfectly intact
and giving forth a delightful odour, was cut off in
1284 and bestowed on his sister the Countess of
San Severino, who placed it in a silver reliquary:
<!--
112 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
her son, Thomas, afterwards gave it to the Dominicans 
of Salerno.<p>

Early in the year 1304, in consequence of a
report that Pope Benedict XI meant to restore the
remains to the Friars Preachers, the Cistercians
amputated the head and placed it in a tabernacle
behind the choir; the body, still exhaling the same
fragrance, they deposited in a massive chest for
secret concealment. It was privately conveyed to
the Chapel of the Count of Fondi, another kinsman
of the holy Doctor. The Lord of Piperno, who was
at feud with him, resolved on carrying off the 
treasure, so as to extort a heavy ransom. Philip, King
of Sicily, now sent an embassy of bishops and
nobles, together with a great donation of gold, in
order to secure the holy remains, alleging his claim
of descent from the Aquinos: but the Count of
Fondi would not deliver them up. Years went
past, until St. Thomas admonished the Count that
his relics were not in their proper place. His
mother, who had been healed at his intercession,
was praying with the Bishop of Fondi before the
great chest, when both beheld him emerge as a
living man, and after walking for a short time in
silence, laid himself down again to rest. In 
consequence of this, the Count resigned the body
to the Dominicans of Fondi, who placed it in their
church. Here, for the second time, St. Thomas
came forth visibly before Father Raymund. The
Cistercians addressed a complaint to Pope Urban
V, who ordered an investigation to be made as to
<!--
113 TRANSLATIONS OF HIS RELICS.
-->
the respective claims of the two Orders; the rights
of the Friars Preachers were warmly urged by the
Queen of Sicily, the Count of Aquino, and the
Dominican Cardinals. The Father General, Elias
of Toulouse, then went direct to the Pope. "You
come at the right time," said Urban; "it is you
who stole the body of St. Thomas." "Holy Father,"
answered Elias, "he is our brother and our flesh."<p>

"And where then have you ordered it to be 
deposited?" pursued the Pontiff. "Nowhere, Most Holy
Father: that shall be as you decide." Nothing was
then decided; within a few days the Court moved
to Montefiascone, at Whitsuntide, whither Father
Elias followed on Corpus Christi Day. "Holy
Father," said he, "to-day's solemnity reminds me
that St. Thomas composed the Office of the Blessed
Sacrament by order of Pope Urban. Since you
bear the same name, I beseech you to grant to the
Saint the honour he deserves, and that his body
shall rest among his brethren, who will reverence
him more than any others." Raising his voice, the
Pope gave solemn sentence. "By the authority of
our Lord Jesus Christ, of the blessed Apostles
Peter and Paul, and our own, I give and grant to
you, the Master General, and to the Order of Friars
Preachers, the body of St. Thomas Aquinas, a
religious of this Order, to be placed at Toulouse, or
Paris, as shall be decided by the General Chapter
or the Master General. In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." All present
then answered <i>"Amen!"</i> Next day the Pope
<!--
114 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
fixed upon Toulouse, as being the cradle of the
order. Learning that the head was still at Fossa
Nuova, he continued: "And I also give you St.
Thomas's head, that it may be translated with
the body".<p>

On 4 August, 1368, the head and body were laid
in the papal chapel at Montefiascone, and solemnly
delivered over to the Master General's keeping.
The relics reposed for a month with the Dominican
Sisters at Prouille, and many were the miracles
wrought on the way. On 28 January, 1369, they
were solemnly conveyed to the Dominican Church
in Toulouse by Louis Duke of Anjou, many 
prelates, and a concourse of 150,000 persons. The
festival of his Translation became a day of precept
for the diocese. His right arm was bestowed on
Paris University, and was placed by King Charles
in the Dominican Church, in St. Thomas's Chapel;
at the Great Revolution it was conveyed to Rome,
and now rests in the Minerva Church. The chief
bone of his left arm was given to his brethren in
Naples, who transferred it to the Cathedral in
1603.<p>

In 1628 a magnificent shrine, with altars at the
four sides, was erected in Toulouse. At the Great
Revolution it was thrown down, and the remains,
draped with the Republican flag, conveyed for
safety by the Constitutional clergy to an obscure
corner in St. Sernin's crypt. They were exposed
for veneration in 1805; the sacred head was 
enclosed in a new reliquary in the year 1852. On

COMMENDATIONS OF HIS DOCTRINE.<p>

IN the Council of Trent, Master John Gallio de
Burgos eulogized his writings: "The name of the
Angelic Doctor, already so renowned throughout
the Christian world, will be held in still higher
veneration by posterity from the honour and cultus
which you have been pleased to bestow upon him
here. St. Thomas had not the honour of assisting
at a General Council during his lifetime, but he still
lives on after death. He is present with you in the
spiritual treasures of his writings, bequeathed to
you as a rich heritage. In this sense we can rest
assured that no Council has ever been held in the
Church since his blessed death, at which the holy
Doctor has not been present, and has not been
consulted."<p>

Pope St. Pius V proclaimed him Doctor of the
Church in the year 1567. The Vatican Council
of 1870 likewise placed his "Summa" on the
altar.<p>

On 4 August, 1879, Pope Leo XIII published
the Encyclical "AEterni Patris," dwelling on the
importance of basing Christian dogma on sound
<!--
116 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
Philosophy. "Amongst the Scholastic Doctors,
the Prince and Master of all, Thomas Aquinas,
shines with incomparable splendour. Enriched
with all Divine and human sciences, justly 
compared to the sun, he reanimates the earth by the
bright rays of his virtues, while filling it with the
splendour of his doctrine. Distinguishing accurately 
between reason and faith, he unites them in
the bonds of perfect concord, while preserving the
rights and maintaining the dignity of each. So
then, reason, upborne on the wings of Thomas, can
soar no higher, while faith can obtain from reason
no more numerous and efficacious helps than those
furnished by Thomas.<p>

"We cannot wonder then at the immense enthusiasm of 
former ages for the writings of the Angelic
Doctor. Nearly all the founders and legislators of
Religious Orders have ordered their subjects to
study the doctrine of St. Thomas, and to keep to it
religiously: they have provided beforehand that no
one amongst them should depart with impunity,
even in the least point, from the teaching of so great
a man."<p>

Another Brief followed on 4 August, 1880.
"In virtue of our supreme authority, for the glory
of Almighty God, and the honour of the Angelic
Doctor, for the advancement of learning and the
common welfare of human society, we declare the
Angelic Doctor, St. Thomas Aquinas, Patron of all
Universities, Academies, Colleges, and Catholic
<!--

Schools: and we desire that he should be venerated
and honoured as such by all."<p>
