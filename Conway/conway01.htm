CHAPTER I.<p>

BIRTH AND EARLY EDUCATION.<p>

THE noble Aquino family could boast of a descent
through four centuries from the Lombard Princes,
besides being allied with the Sovereign houses of
Europe in the thirteenth century. The family
name was a territorial one, which in Latin and
French idioms of speech appears as Aquinas and
d'Aquin. St. Thomas was born in the Castle of
Rocca Secca, perched high in the mountains, some
even miles from Aquino which lies in the plain
below, in the Campagna Felice of the Kingdom of
Naples. He first saw the light in the opening days
the year 1225, less than four years from the death
of St. Dominic. Landulg his father, was nephew
to the Emperor Frederick I; he belonged to the
noble house of Sommacoli, and was Count of
Aquino, Lord of Loreto, Acerra, and Belcastro.
His mother, Theodora Carraciola, Countess of
Teano in her own right, was sprung from the Norman 
Princes. St. Thomas, their third son, was
<!--
2 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
cousin to the Emperors Henry VI and Frederick II
and closely allied to the Kings of Aragon, Castile,
and France; while on his grandmother's side he
could trace descent from England's Saxon Kings.
For godfather he had Pope Honorius III, the
Pontiff who confirmed the Order of Preachers, of
which the child was destined to be the brightest
luminary. The Aquinos were a military race, so
Landulf gave to his third son a name already
famous in arms, Thomas, in memory of his own
father, who had been Captain-General of the 
Imperial forces; little did he dream then that the
boy would be a soldier of Christ, wielding the
sword of Truth, and an undying leader of 
intellectual hosts.<p>

The future holiness of the unborn babe was
disclosed to his mother by a holy hermit of the
neighbourhood, known simply as Buono, or God's
good man. Clad in a rough garment, and with
hair unkempt, he presented himself at Rocca Secca,
and pointing to a picture of the holy patriarch
St. Dominic, who was not yet canonized, he thus
addressed the Countess: "Lady, be glad, for thou
art about to have a son whom thou shalt call
Thomas. Thou and thy husband will think if
making him a monk in the Abbey of Monte Cassino, 
where St. Benedict's body reposes, in the
hopes that your son will attain to its honours and
wealth. But God has disposed otherwise, because
he will become a friar of the Order of Preachers
and so great will be his learning and sanctity that
<!--
BIRTH AND EARLY EDUCATION 3
-->
his equal will not be found through the whole
world." Theodora listened with awe to the pregsage, 
then, falling upon her knees, exclaimed "I
am all unworthy of bearing such a son, but, God's
will be done according to His good pleasure".<p>

In due time the child was baptized under the
name of Thomas, which signifies <i>Abyss</i>, while the
Bishop of Aquino stood as proxy for the Sovereign
Pontiff. In God's deep counsels a name imposed
often stands prophetic of destiny so was it in this
instance, for in after days "the abyss put forth its
voice (Habacuc iii. 10). From the hour of the
prophetic telling, Thomas was the fruit of her soul
by prayer as of a mother's womb by nature. A
special providence watched over him during infancy. 
One night in June, 1228, a lightning stroke
smote the tower in which the child of grace lay
sleeping beside his nurse: in agony of mind the
alarmed mother ran to the spot, to find him unharmed, 
while her little daughter lay dead and
charred, and the horses in the stables beneath were
killed. This occurrence left in him a life-long 
nervousness and dread of storms, which he could never
allay. In consequence of this, in later years in a
subterranean cave at Anagni, he traced upon the
walls in capital letters this distich in fashion of a
cross<p>

Crux. Mihi. Certa. Salus.<br>
Crux. Est. Quam. Semper. Adoro.<br>
Crux. Domini. Mecum.<br>
Crux. Mihi. Refugium.
<!--
4 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
The Cross is my sure safety.<br>
It is the Cross that I ever adore.<br>
The Lord's Cross is with me.<br>
The Cross is my refuge.<p>

[An Indulgence of 300 days is attached to its recital.]<p>

Thomas was a gentle child, with deep lustrous
eyes and thoughtful expression of countenance, in
whom piety appeared as a Divine gift of nature,
an inborn sense of soul. His earliest turnings of
mind and heart were to God, so that even in the
dawn of his day he was spoken of as a child of
grace. Free from the wonted petulance of childhood, 
he showed little of its giddiness, still he was
always cheerful and of modest demeanour. He
loved to gaze with eyes of wonder on the illuminated 
pages of missals or scripts which he was incapable of 
understanding, while the stillness of the
chapel with its solitary light exercised a fascination
on his tender mind. Gentle and fleeting as a
Spring shower are the tears of childhood. If at
any time they fell from his sunny face, the sight of
a book or manuscript would always comfort him:
it was his toy, his plaything, and to turn the pages
ever and again was his little world of joy; clearly
the child was father of the man. There is something 
startling, even eerie, in a child's piety, in its
innocence, unconscious of guile, in its human faith
of trust, its first turnings upwards: like the turning
of the flower to the sun is a child's soul stirred and
drawn heavenwards. When the Psalmist broke
<!--
BIRTH AND EARLY EDUCATION. 5
-->
out in rhapsody: "Thy magnificence, O Lord, is
elevated above the heavens," he instantly turns to
the thought of the child: "Out of the mouths of 
infants and of sucklings Thou hast perfected praise":
(Ps. viii. 2, 3). All this we have to realize in the
child hood of St. Thomas, whose young virgin soul, 
like some clear pool, reflected the Creator's image:
As the first years drew on, he, like another Holy
Child in Nazareth, grew in spiritual beauty before
God and men. His angelic comeliness and sweetness 
of disposition increased, so that he charmed
irresistibly all with whom he came in contact.<p>

The first parting with home came in the autumn
of 1231, when he was but six and a half years old.
Six miles away to the south stands the venerable
Abbey of Monte Cassino on a high plateau, and
visible from Aquino and Rocca Secca. This ancient 
home of learning and piety was the school
in which Count Landulf placed his boy, not in
the cloister, but in the school for youths of gentle
birth, since the old time custom of placing children 
in the cloister was extinct by papal mandate
quite a century before. The monks of St. Benedict
were deeply beholden to the Aquinos, who had
defended their sanctuary against Roger, King of
Sicily : at this very time the Lord Abbot, the
fiftieth in line, was the young scholar's uncle,
Landulf Sennebald. There the boy spent five
years under the tutelage of those God-fearing men,
but attended by his family tutor or governor, while
the rare gifts of mind and soul expanded. It was
<!--
6 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
not an unbroken stay in the abbey, for when the
holidays came round, he rode to Loreto or Belcastro 
to regain his family circle. During his stay
in the school he learnt the common elements of a
child's education, how to speak and write correctly
his native Italian tongue, also the rudiments of
Latin and French: to this would naturally be
added the religious catechism suited to his tender
years, and the school discipline of obedience. The
memory of his residence there was long treasured
up, and rehearsed in after days by the monks, who
loved to speak of the precocious mind which would
muse on Divine problems, and put such questions
as these: "What is God? How can we know
God? What is Truth? Anything savouring of
levity or carelessness was never seen in him: however 
amiable he was towards his young companions
or ready to pay them a service, he was slow to join
in their boyish chatter, slower still at joining in
their games. His refining influence made itself
felt among them, but the companionship he prized
most was a book, and his favourite retreat the
church. The atmosphere of the quiet cloistered
precincts was a congenial one: it nurtured his
observant powers, and formed the silent thinker,
the prayerful spirit, who spoke so deeply in maturer years.<p>

Mid-way between his eleventh and twelfth years
came the violent transition which so often mars
characters of promise. The shy boy, with those
round ox-like eyes set deep and clear, must pass
<!--
BIRTH AND EARLY EDUCATION. 7
-->
from peace to tumult, from private to public schools,
and to streets often mad with revelry. What the
school begins, the University completes, with its
fuller range of sciences, its vaster auditory, its skilled
professors: so, acting on the advice of Abbot Senebald, 
the boy passes the threshold of a Catholic
University. The choice lay between two such seats
of learning, far-away Bologna of long-standing eminence, 
and its younger rival, Naples, which was
close to hand. A law of the Emperor Frederick II,
its founder, forbade his subjects to study elsewhere
than in Naples, so Count Landulf's choice was reduced 
to one of compliance. During this summer's
holiday time, which was spent at Loreto, Thomas
busied himself in visiting the needy and relieving
their wants, especially since famine was pressing
severely on the country. Not content with carrying 
constantly the common necessaries of life, he
often brought to them the delicacies meant for his
own use. Such generosity being reported in an
uofavourable light to his father, the Count resolved
on curbing his actions, if not his compassion. One
morning as the boy was speeding forth on his errand
of mercy, with a supply of white bread under his
cloak, Landulf stayed his steps, and demanded to
be shown what he was carrying away. Crimsoned
with confusion, Thomas was about to explain, when
the father roughly plucked the cloak aside, and an
armful of fragrant roses fell at his feet. The father
saw the hand of God in the act, for he had been
stealthily watching the tender culprit, then he strode
<!--
8 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
hastily away in tears; long he pondered over the
reports which had reached his willing ears, of the
glowing halo seen at times round the mysterious
boy's head.<p>

It was in the autumn of 1236 that Thomas
Aquinas entered Naples University. He had his
own residence and retinue, but continued under
the vigilant eye of the same governor as when at
Monte Cassino, who now acted as his good angel
in the city so aptly described as -- "a very paradise
of God, but inhabited by demons". Knowledge
of evil is not of itself evil, else the angels would not
be clean: so the boy's clear perception of worldliness 
and flaunted vice served only to foster his
spirit of reserve, of communing with God, while,
like Daniel in Babylon, he prayed to be kept clean.
Making the Psalmist's speech his own, be made
daily use of these brief prayers: -- "Prove me, Lord,
and try me. Lord, let Thy face shine upon Thy
servant, teach me Thy ways of holiness. Guide my
steps according to Thy behest, that no iniquity may
take hold of me." Lodged according to his rank,
he often rode round the fair bay of Naples, past the
glowing splendour or frequent fury of Vesuvius,
images to him of heaven and of hell, to gaze on
the sites of cities long buried, Pompeii, and 
Herculaneum, or else crossing the waters, to behold the
wonders of the blue grottoes of Capri. Nowhere
else is Nature garbed in richer array, but it cried to
him only of God, while his soul found response in
the exclamation of Augustine of Hippo: "If the
<!--
BIRTH AND EARLY EDUCATION. 9
-->
works of His hands be so lovely, O how much more
beautiful must He be Who made them!" The
words of the Creator's approval kept recurring in
memory: "And He saw that they were good ".
What holds the natural man to earth, uplifts the
spiritual man heavenwards; so in his ripening youth
he was fired with the poetry of Nature, but as a
Divine song.<p>

During the seven years of his stay, as the boy
grew into the man of uncommon stature in body
and intellect, he studied to good purpose under
men of eminence. He pursued the course of
studies which was common to all Universities of
the time. During four years he passed through the
Trivium, under the distinguished Pietro Martini:
this comprised grammar
[The study of the poets, the historians, and the art of
speaking and writing properly],
logic and rhetoric, which
he completed when fourteen and a half years old.
The higher studies of the Quadrivium, a three years'
course, embracing music, mathematics, geometry,
and astronomy, he pursued under a professor of
note, Peter from Ireland. There can be no doubt
of the fact that our saintly scholar graduated in
both courses, which covered the whole range of
the classics, logic, and physics. Both masters
held him in high esteem, and constantly pointed
him out as a pattern of industry. A singularly 
retentive memory and sense of logic enabled him to
repeat the lesson more deeply and lucidly than the
professors had given it, so that the scholars came
<!--
10 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
to regard him as a miracle of holiness and learning, 
an angel in the schools, though not yet "The
Angel of the Schools". Such talent left him much
leisure time, yet without idleness, for it was all
given to assimilating knowledge by method and
discipline.<p>

Man's soul is simple in its nature, but very complex 
in its workings, especially when acting through
the senses. The <i>Pars Superior</i> is the soul untrammelled 
in its purely spiritual workings of understanding or 
volition, regarding things which are
beyond Nature's horizon. At its greatest altitude
it rises up to the Divine. The <i>Pars Inferior</i> is the
same spirit working through the senses. As Aristotle 
observes, and the Schoolmen agree, "there is
nothing in the understanding except it first come
under the senses": from this common rule one
must exclude first principles, which all mankind
instantly accepts because of their self-evideAce.
Education is nothing else than the drawing out
of these parts with their latent powers, even as
Nature's secret forces can be drawn forth by attraction: 
thus while the powers are sharpened, their
store of accretions is termed knowledge. Now all
this economy of the mind was grasped by the
youthful Aquinas, and brought to bear on his
threefold plan of self-education. Endowed with
genius of intellect, as the eagle soaring above the
commoner birds of the air, he first carefully scanned,
then boldly swept across the intellectual horizon.
his first field of education was Divine. God was
<!--
BIRTH AND EARLY EDUCATION. 11
-->
his centre of gravity, to which he ever inclined, his
highest zone of speculative thought, his fountainhead 
of spirituality in mind and heart. Such education is 
productive of sanctity, because it is seeking and 
finding, feeding upon and assimilating
Divine Truth, not as from afar, but by union of
intimacy with Him Who is Truth. If the child
queried -- What is Truth? and What is God?
the youth answered his own query: "God is
Truth, and all truth is of God". Such pursuit of
highest truth produces wisdom, of which, as of
compassion, he could say: "It grew with me from
infancy" (Job xxxi. 18). "Wisdom led the just
man along righteous ways, showed him God's kingdom, 
and imparted to him the knowledge of holy
things" (Wis. x. 10). Thomas was a theologian
in potency as one wedded to Divine Wisdom.<p>

His second domain of industry in learning was
among men. In the writings left of the ancients,
he found thought distributed among the poets,
the orators, the philosophers: these he read 
studiously now, and stored them up in the cells of
memory. Most of them he read but once in a
lifetime, and that was at this very period: of course
all Thomist students are quite aware of the great
exception with regard to Aristotle's works, for these
were constantly at his elbow. All is true subjectively 
in the writings of those men of old-time fame,
that is, if judged from their standpoint, and according 
the schools they represented: much therein
is true also objectively, and elevating even from
<!--
12 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
our Christian coign of vantage. But the question
with the solid thinker is -- where precisely to fix his
standpoint. In first principles all men are agreed,
with few dissentients, such as sceptics, and even
these postulate some one first principle: the parting 
of the ways comes where Revelation steps in,
uplifting and guiding Reason. From Aristotle
to St. Thomas, philosophy made no sensible progress, 
but rather the reverse: but when the saint
Christianized the Stagyrite, and brought his writings 
into line with Revelation, then the thoughts of
men reverted to the past, and grew vigorous in
consequence. Such was the scholastic revival of
the thirteenth century, devised by this vigorous
young thinker in Naples.<p>

His third field of self-culture was Nature, whose
open page all men read, and so few understand.
He was a careful observer of Nature's laws, of
matter, and force, and forms, and causalities: but
while turning to Nature he was no slavish empiricist, 
as will be seen later on. With him, mentality
ever held the first place. Above all things he was
consistent, because consistency comes of an evenly
balanced mind: the Eclecticism of past and present
teachers he would certainly have ascribed to the
inconsistency of illogical minds, resulting in a
perversion of order, and stultifying of principles. In
Naples this youth had assimilated from his reading
all that Cicero has comprised in his definition of
Philosophy: "The knowledge of things Divine and
human and of their disposing causes".

CHAPTER II.<p>

VOCATION AND TRIALS.<p>

HAVING seen the scholar in his morn of toil, let us
now turn to the youth aspiring to the Religious
state: bent on rising to spiritual perfection according 
to grace, he naturally sought out and embraced
the state which is conducive to such perfection.<p>

The germ of a vocation to the Religious life, and
to the Dominican form of such life in particular,
fell early upon his eager soul, where it germinated
through nine years before blossoming into reality
of fulfilment. When but nine and a half years old
he witnessed a spectacle at Monte Cassino which
entered deeply into his soul: it was the solemnity
of St. Dominic's canonization Mass, granted on 13
July, and kept on 5 August, 1234, the exaltation
of that Dominic who so recently had been the
"Doctor of Truth and Preacher of Grace," the
story of whose life was fresh on men's lips. There
is a spiritual affinity in saintship, so the spirit of
the child went out to the man of God who was
soon to call him son. In the Dominican church at
Naples, Thomas was often seen absorbed in prayer,
while spreading rays of light shone from his head.
The friars were well aware of it, so that, after
witnessing the marvel for the third time, Fr. John
of St. Julien said to him: "Our Lord has given
you to our Order". Ripening intimacy begot
resolve. When he was but fifteen and a half years
<!--
14 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
of age, on the completion of his <i>Trivium</i>, he
declared to the Prior of San Domenico that for
some time he had ardently desired to give himself
to the Order. On bended knees he made his
humble suit and protestation: "But I am not
worthy, and is not my age an obstacle?" Fr.
Thomas d'Agni di Lentino, the Prior, and Fr. John
of St. Julien, a famous preacher, bade him foster
the grace of a vocation, but advised him to wait for
three more years. This he accordingly did. When
eighteen and a half years of age, he was clothed in
the holy habit as a Friar Preacher, in August, 1243,
probably on St. Dominic's feast-day, which was then
kept on the 5th. It was a momentous step, a
memorable occasion, for the ceremony was carried
out before a distinguished assembly. Not a word
was spoken to parents or to others of his design:
he had learnt his lesson from a saying of Tobias:
"It is a good thing to hide the King's secret"
(xii. 7). From that happy hour until death his
conduct might be expressed in the language of St.
Paul: "Forgetting the things that are behind, and
stretching forth myself to those that are before, I
pursue towards the mark, for the prize of the
heavenly vocation of God in Christ Jesus" (Phil.
iii, 13-14).<p>

Soon the tidings reached Rocca Secca that
Thomas had entered the cloister of the Preaching 
Friars, which evoked a storm of indignation.
His mother was especially angered, not because he
l~ad chosen to quit the worLd, but at the unpardon<!--
VOCATION AND TRIALS. 15
-->able affront of the scion of a princely house donning
the garb of a mendicant friar. Complaints were
addressed to the Pope and to the Archbishop of
Naples, while loud were the menaces uttered against
the Father General and the Prior, and these were
caught up by the common herd in the street: as
for the monks of the two Benedictine communities
in Naples and their brethren of Monte Cassino, they
made no protest, advanced no plea, since it was no
concern of theirs, nor did they move or speak at
his profession two years later. Theodora d'Aquino
was a woman of resolute spirit, now thoroughly
roused: hermits may prophesy, that is their business, 
but the settlement of a son is a domestic affair,
largely a woman's affair, if she can but have her
way. But no sooner did she perceive that noise
and fury would not prevail, than she set out for
Naples with masked batteries of tears and entreaties, 
to Induce him to return home. One thing
she overlooked in her gage of battle, and that was
that her son was also an Aquino, a man of like
determined character, though of calmer mood.
Directly Thomas heard of her setting out, he took
the by-road to Rome, and entered the Convent of
Santa Sabina, St. Dominic's former home on the
Aventine. Thither the eager mother pursued him.
Strong in his sense of fidelity to a Divine call,
Thomas refused even to see her when she clamoured 
in the porch. "Whoever loves father or
mother more than Me, is not worthy of Me"
(Matt. x. 37). What his sentiments were then he
<!--
16 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
subsequently wrote in his "Summa Theologica"
(IIa IIae Quest. CIX, article 4), when treating of
piety, or duty towards parents. The article is
entitled -- "Whether Duties towards Parents Are To
Be Set Aside for the Sake of Religion". The
answer is a distinct negative, but admitting of one
saving exception, which he exposes in the following
terms: --<p>

"If reverence for parents withdraws us from
God's worship, then we must not stand by duty to
parents against God. Accordingly St. Jerome says
in his Letter to Heliodorus, towards the opening:
'Set father aside, treading upon him, set mother
aside, treading upon her, with dry eyes fly to the
standard of the Cross: to be cruel in such a matter
is the height of piety'. Consequently, in such an
issue, the duties of filial piety must be set aside for
the sake of the Divine worship of religion. But if
by rendering due reverence to parents we are not
withdrawn from God's worship, then it will be a
part of piety, and so it will not be necessary to drop
piety for the sake of religion."<p>

While the Countess made Rome ring with her
complaints and threats, the heroic novice hurried
off northwards to Paris. Straightway Theodora
vowed to capture and hold the runaway: a mounted
courier was speedily dispatched to her elder sons,
Landulf and Raynald, who then commanded the
Emperor's forces in Tuscany, bidding them to seize
him <i>vi et armis</i>. Thomas was resting by a spring
with two friars, close to the little town of Acqua<!--
VOCATION AND TRIALS. 17
-->pendente, between Sienna and Lake Bolsena, when
a troop of horse surprised him. His brothers reviled
him for his undutiful behaviour, then bade him
put off his habit and return home. Raynald laid
violent hands upon him and tried to tear it from his
shoulders, but to no purpose, so the brothers led
him back to Rocca Secca. Since his resolution
was not to be shaken, at their father's bidding the
brothers led him off to the village of Monte San
Giovanni, some two miles away, where they shut
him as a close prisoner in the castle tower. There
he was subjected to harsh treatment, stripped of his
religious habit, reviled, and deprived of every comfort. 
Count Landulf visited his son from time to
time to induce him, nay, force him, to forsake the
Dominican life: he left a costly suit of garments,
and a Benedictine habit, declaring he would be
fully satisfied if Thomas would but don the one or
the other. What he looked to was pride of place:
his son should grace the Court, or rule as Lord
Abbot of Monte Cassino.<p>

Like Christ in the desert, the novice had to
encounter three classes of temptation, and came
forth victorious. The world tempted him, first by
the softness of a mother's tears and entreaties
when these failed of their purpose, it tried the
coaxings of his worldly minded sisters, who 
rehearsed the father's plea of fame at Court or in
arms, or else in Church preferment. By simple
and earnest discourse the novice won them over
completely to God: Marietta, the elder sister, em<!--
18 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->braced the cloistered state, and died as Abbess of
St. Mary's at Capua; Theodora, afterwards Countess
of Marisco, entered upon a life of singular holiness.
From that hour both laboured to ameliorate his
hardships.<p>

A stronger temptation then assailed him through
the baseness of his brothers. Lust of the flesh is
death to spirituality: so they bribed a base woman
to try her lures, and entangle him in the Circe web
of sin. Seizing a burning faggot from the hearth,
he drove her from the chamber, then, falling on his
knees, he traced the sign of the Cross upon the
wall with the flaming brand, and poured out his
soul in thanks to God. Presently a gentle sleep
stole upon him, like to Adam's sleep of innocence
in Paradise. Then by his side he beheld two
angels who girt him about with a lily-white girdle,
saying the while: "We come to thee from God, to
bestow upon thee the grace of perpetual virginity".
They girded him so tightly that he awoke with a
loud cry of pain. He wore the sacred girdle all
through life, and only revealed the secret at its
close to Fr. Reginald of Piperno, who was his
bosom friend and confessor, assuring him that from
that hour he was never again conscious of the
slightest sensual motions. The prison cell in after
years was turned into a chapel, which may yet be
seen in a dilapidated condition. The angelic girdle
was preserved with reverence in the convent of his
Order at Vercelli, in Piedmont, down to the suppression 
of the religious houses during the wars of
<!--
VOCATION AND TRIALS. 19
-->
Napoleon I: it is now kept at Chieri, near Turin,
the first house restored.<p>

This precious relic was solemnly transferred in
1894 to a new reliquary, which is a magnificent
work of art, made of bronze over-gilt. Standing
quite six feet six inches in height, of hexagonal shape
and Gothic design, it has six medallions on the
base, displaying scenes in his life, wrought in finest
Roman enamel. Around the knop in the centre
of the stem are the same number of statuettes of
Dominican saints, wrought in silver, and under
canopies. The reliquary superimposed is also a
hexagon, with a double set of silver statuettes, six
to each row, allegorical figures below, and angels
with musical instruments above, after the designs
of Fra Angelico. Enclosed within a crystal case,
a much larger angel, with outspread arms, displays
the sacred girdle, now grown brown with age, which
is held in place by rings and threads of silver. A
figure of the Angelic Doctor, all resplendent in
gold, stands on high, beneath a pierced tower-shaped 
canopy, which is finally topped by a gold cross.<p>

Meanwhile his superiors and brethren had not
forgotten him as the months grew into a year, and
beyond. Father John of St. Julien contrived to
visit him several times, and supplied him with
another religious habit of the Order, which so
offended Count Landulf that he held him in durance 
for some days. Books too were gradually
supplied to relieve the tedium of imprisonment;

this was done through his sister's good offices: the
works supplied were carefully committed to memory; 
these were Aristotle's "Metaphysics," the
"Sentences" of Peter Lombard, and portions of
the Sacred Scriptures. The Friars Preachers lodged
complaints with Pope Innocent IV and the Emperor 
Frederick against such unjust privation of
liberty, each of whom sent stringent orders for his
release. The pride of the soldier sons was roused
at such commands, nor would they comply, but
consented to connive at his escape. Like a second
Paul, he was let down from a window in a basket
into the arms of brethren who conducted him to
Naples, "their hearts leaping with joy at having
recovered their Joseph, who was endowed with the
spirit of understanding like Jacob's son" (Tocco).
He had endured a close and painful imprisonment
for about eighteen months, so now, after a short 
probation in the cloister, he was admitted to solemn
Vows in January, 1245
[Acta S.S. Mar. vii. 710; Tocca II. 12],
making profession into the
hands of the same Prior who had clothed him in
the habit of St. Dominic.
[The Prior, Thomas d'Agni di Lentino, subsequently
became Patriarch of Jerusalem.]<p>

Having conquered world and flesh, the holy
youth had yet to vanquish the devil. Even earnest
Christians are at times unconsciously obsessed by
the lying spirit: deceived themselves, they labour
to mislead others. So was it now, when "the
father of lies" spoke by many mouths to "the
<!--
VOCATION AND TRIALS. 21
-->
Father of the faithful". Appeals and complaints
were addressed to Pope Innocent, calling upon
him to annul the profession just made. Some
urged the impropriety of a prince turning mendicant, 
since he was a possible heir to the titles and
estates: in fact he did survive his elder brothers.
Others again alleged defect of liberty in the novice;
while not a few of his kinsmen pleaded nullity from
the ignorance of a youth who did not know the
world he had forsaken, nor realize the sacrifice he
had made. At the word of obedience, Thomas
presented himself before the Holy Father in Rome,
and vanquished Satan by outspoken truthfulness.
The Pontiff examined carefully the novice's motives 
in choosing the life and in making profession,
listened tenderly to the story of his vocation, and
ratified all that he had done.<p>


[The idle story of his having been a Benedictine monk
for over twelve years, first came up in the early eighteenth
century, and has again been served up in our own days.
Such was the contention of an anonymous brochure issued
in 1724, professing to be printed in Lyons, but in fact
printed in Venice: "De monachatu Benedictino Divi
Thomae Aquinatis". In it his birth is antedated by five
years, to 26 April, 1220. It was promptly refuted by
another publication entitled, "De Fabula monachatus
Benedictini Divi Thomae Aquinatis," issued in the same
year at Venice. The only foundation for the fable was the
testimony of Bartholomew of Capua, Protonotary and
Chancellor of Sicily, in his deposition for the saint's
canonization. His actual words are these: "His father
presented the said friar Thomas to the monastery when
quite a child, with the idea of his being one day raised to
<!--
22 ST. THOMAS AQUINAS.
-->
the government of the Abbey". When the Pope actually
offered him the rank in mature years, even retaining his
Dominican habit, St. Thomas would not hear of it.]<p>

Baring his very soul to Pope Innocent, he
pleaded his cause with candour: while blaming
no one, he declared his whole ambition was absorbed 
in a vocation to renounce all worldly advantages, 
so as to serve God and the cause of
Truth by becoming a Friar Preacher. On this.
point he was unbending: so the Holy Father dismissed 
him with a blessing, and forbade any further
attempts to be made to hinder him from following.
his manifest vocation.<p>

After the threefold storm came a lull, a great
calm. Out of the fullness of the heart, the tongue
grows eloquent: so now from overflowing piety he
composed and ever after used this prayer : -- 
"Lord Jesus Christ, I pray that the fiery and
honey-sweet power of Thy love may detach my
soul from everything under heaven, so that I may.
die from love of Thy love, Who, out of love for.
mine, did'st die upon the tree of the Cross.
Amen."<p>

Thus, in the opening days of a gracious life,
"he shone as the morning star in the midst of
a cloud" (Ecclus. L. 6).<p>
