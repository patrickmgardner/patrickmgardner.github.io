"It is better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a pig satisfied " (J. S. 
Mill, <i>Utilitarianism</i>, pp. 11-16 ed. 2). St Thomas argues that as 
there is something within the pig's reach which will satisfy the pig, 
there must be something within Socrates's reach which will satisfy 
Socrates. Though Socrates dissatisfied is better off than the pig, yet 
he is not well off -- for Socrates.
