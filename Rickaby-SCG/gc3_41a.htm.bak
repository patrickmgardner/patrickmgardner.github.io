"A separately subsistent intelligence," writes St Thomas (Chap. XLI), 
"by knowing its own essence, knows both what is above it and what is 
below it, particularly if what is above it is also its cause, since the 
likeness of the cause must be found in the effect. Hence, since God is 
the cause of all created subsistent intelligences, they, by knowing 
their own essences, know by some sort of vision (<i>per modum visionis 
cujusdam</i>) even God Himself: for a thing is known by intellect in a 
manner of vision, when its likeness exists in intellect: whatever 
intellect then apprehends a separately subsistent intelligence, and 
knows the same in its essential nature, sees God in a higher way than 
is possible by any of the modes of cognition already mentioned." Know 
an angel, then, or pure spirit, in his essence, and you will thereby 
have a higher knowledge of God than any that you could attain by any 
other speculation of science or philosophy. Consequently, if the 
knowledge of God be happiness, happiness, it seems, will best open to 
us men, if we can find some method of reading the innermost natures of 
angels. Alexander of Aphrodisias (<i>fl</i> A.D. 200), Avempace 
(Ibn-Badja, d. 1138), and Averroes (Ibn-Roschd, d. 1198), each was 
quoted in St Thomas's day as the author of a method enabling men to do 
this, methods which St Thomas elaborately confutes in these 
chapters.<p> 

Avempace's plan was to study the speculative sciences, and thence 
forming abstract generalisations, one higher than the other, -- or 
perhaps he meant (what is by no means the same thing) one fuller 
of 'content' than the other, -- to ascend to the cognition of pure 
intelligence. St Thomas describes the process in scholastic terms, 
thus; "to extract the quiddity of everything which is not its own 
quiddity; and if that quiddity has a quiddity, again to abstract the 
quiddity of that quiddity, till we come to a stand somewhere, arriving 
by the method of analysis at the knowledge of the quiddity of a being, 
subsisting apart, which has not another quiddity" (Chap. XLI): which 
words perhaps need some explanation. "The quiddity of a thing which is 
not its own quiddity" means then an essence, or essential quality, 
which is shared by many subjects, and is not all embodied in one 
subject, constituting that subject entirely. Thus prudence is in Cato, 
and in many others besides. Cato is not all prudence: he is not the 
embodiment of sheer prudence and nothing else. Prudence then in Cato is 
a quiddity which is not its own quiddity. St Thomas well observes that 
Avempace's method is Platonic Idealism revived. He adds that, starting 
as our abstractions must, from sensible objects, we can never attain to 
a view of the essential nature of a pure spirit. "If by understanding 
of the natures and quiddities of sensible things, we arrive at an 
understanding of separately subsistent intelligences, that 
understanding of such intelligences must be reached through some one of 
the speculative sciences. But we do not see how this is to be done: for 
there is no speculative science which teaches concerning any one of the 
separately subsistent intelligences what it is in essence, but only the 
fact of its existence" (Chap. XLI).<p> 

-- Averroes, as might have been expected, proceeds upon his favourite 
notion of the <i>continuatio</i>, or conjunction of the individual mind 
with the one vast intelligence, active and potential, that is without 
(B. II, Chap. <A HREF="gc2_60.htm">LX</a>). St Thomas's summary of the 
Commentator's views ends thus -- (it is a very free paraphrase of 
Averroes's words as they appear in the Latin of the Venice edition of 
1574, pp. 186, 187): "This perfect progress towards conjunction with 
the supreme intelligence comes of zealous study of the speculative 
sciences, whereby true intellectual notions are acquired, and false 
opinions are excluded, such opinions lying beyond the line of this 
progress, like monstrous births outside of the line of the operation of 
nature. To this advance men help one another by helping one another in 
the speculative sciences. When then all things now potentially 
intelligible come to be in us actually understood, then the active 
intellect: will be perfectly conjoined with us as a form, and we shall 
understand by it perfectly. Hence, since it belongs to the active 
intellect to understand substances existing apart, we shall then 
understand those separately subsistent beings as we now understand the 
notions of speculative science; and this will be man's final happiness, 
in which man shall be as a god" (Chap. XLIII).<p> 

If any one used such language in our time, we should understand him to 
mean by <i>continuatio</i>, or union with the supreme intelligence, as 
regards the individual, his instruction up to the level of the science 
of his age; and as regards the age itself, the maintenance of the level 
of science reached by the previous generation, and the further raising 
of that level. But it is not safe to make out an ancient author to have 
meant exactly what his words would mean, if spoken now. St Thomas gives 
a reference to the commentary of Averroes on Aristotle, <i>De 
anima</i>, III, a reference which I have duly followed up. I find that 
Averroes quotes Alexander and Avempace, disagreeing with them both. St 
Thomas, I believe, is indebted to Averroes for his knowledge of 
Alexander and Avempace. Now nowhere in Averroes, nor in either of the 
two authors whom he quotes, do I find any reference whatever to 
separate substances personified as thinking intelligences, or angels, -- 
nor, for that matter, in Aristotle either. The discussion had its 
origin in an unfulfilled promise of Aristotle (<i>De Anima</i> III, vii, 
10) to enquire, <b>ara endechetai t&ocirc;n kech&ocirc;rismen&ocirc;n 
to noein onta auton m&ecirc; kech&ocirc;rismenon megethous;</b> (is it 
possible for the mind, without being itself separate from extended 
body, to understand any of the things that are so separated?) To 
interpret <b>ta kech&ocirc;rismena</b> to mean 'pure spirits' seems 
going a long way beyond Aristotle, who probably meant no more than 
'products of high abstraction': nor did Averroes, commenting on the 
third book of the <i>De anima</i>, or Alexander, or Avempace, as quoted 
in that commentary, mean anything more. The transformation of these 
high abstractions (<b>kech&ocirc;rismena</b>) into thinking beings, 
pure spirits, or angels, was, I conjecture, the work of the 
Neo-Averroists, whom St Thomas encountered at the University of Paris. 
It is with these Averroists, not with Averroes him self, that St Thomas 
mainly contends in these chapters. The argument is intricate, the 
theory which it impugns obsolete, nor is it worth while further to 
detain the modern reader with the discussion. No man now living expects 
to 'pick the brains' of angels, and so find happiness in this life by 
sharing an angel's natural knowledge of God. Nor did Averroes, so far 
as his comments on the <i>De anima</i> show, dream of anything so 
absurd.<p> 

Lest any one should think the expression 'to pick the brains of angels' 
a travesty, I quote the Latin of St Thomas: <i>Si igitur per 
cognitionem intellectivam, quae est ex phantasmatibus, possit pervenire 
aliquis nostrum ad intelligendas substantias separatas, possibile erit 
quod aliquis in hac vita intelligat ipsas substantias separatas, et per 
consequens videndo ipsas substantias separatas participabis modum 
illius cognitionis quo substantia separata intelligens se intelligit 
Deum</i> (Chap. XLI).<p> 

This is the translation: "If then by intellectual knowledge, got out of 
impressions on the phantasy, any one of us could arrive to understand 
subsistent beings existing apart [i.e., pure spirits], it would be 
possible for one in this life to understand those same pure spirits, 
and consequently by seeing [in his mind's eye] those pure spirits he 
would share in the mode of that knowledge whereby a pure spirit, 
understanding itself, understands God." I need hardly remind the reader 
that St Thomas himself rejects this notion, and is, I think, mistaken 
in attributing it to Averroes.
