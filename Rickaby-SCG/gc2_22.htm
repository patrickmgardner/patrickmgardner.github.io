<H1>That God is Almighty</h1>

As creation is the work of God alone, so whatever beings are producible 
only by creation must be immediately produced by Him. Such are all 
spirits,<A HREF="gc2_22a.htm">*</a> the existence of which for the 
present let us suppose,<A HREF="gc2_22b.htm">*</a> and likewise all 
bodily matter. These several existences are immediate effects of 
creative power. Now power is not determined and limited to one effect, 
when it is productive of several effects immediately, and that not out 
of any pre-existent material. I say 'immediately,' because if the 
production were through intermediate agents, the diversity of effects 
might be ascribed to those intermediate causes. I say again 'not out of 
any pre-existent material,' because the same agent by the same action 
causes different effects according to the difference of material. God's 
power then is not determined and limited to one effect.<p> 

2. Every perfect active power is co-extensive with and covers all 
cases of its own proper effect: thus perfect building power would 
extend to everything that could be called a house. But the divine power 
is of itself the cause of being, and being is its proper effect. 
Therefore that power extends to all things that are not inconsistent 
with the idea of being: for if the divine power were available only for 
one particular effect, it would not be the ordinary cause of being, as 
such, but cause of 'this being.' Now what is inconsistent with the idea 
of 'being' is the opposite of 'being,' which is 'not-being.' God then 
can do all things that do not include in themselves the element of 
not-being, that is to say, that do not involve a contradiction.<p>

3. Every agent acts inasmuch as it is in actuality. According then to 
the mode of actuality of each agent in the mode of its active power. 
Now God is perfect actuality, having in Himself the perfections of all 
beings (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>): therefore His 
active power extends to all things that are not inconsistent with 
actual being.<p> 

5. There are three ways in which an effect may not be in the power of 
an agent. In one way, because it has no affinity or likeness to the 
agent, for every agent acts to the production of its own likeness 
somehow:<A HREF="gc2_22c.htm">*</a> hence man cannot be the parent of 
brute or plant, though he can be parent of man, who is more than they. 
In another way, on account of the excellence of the effect, 
transcending the compass of the active power: thus the active power of 
matter cannot produce spirit. In a third way, on account of the 
material being determined to some effect, and the agent having no power 
over it: thus a carpenter cannot make a saw, because his art gives him 
no power over iron. But in none of these ways can an effect be 
withdrawn from the divine power: not for the unlikeness of the effect, 
since every being, in so much as it has being, is like God (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_15.htm">XV</a>): nor again for the excellence of the effect, 
since God is above all in goodness and perfection (B. I, Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>, XLI): nor lastly for the defect of the 
material, since God in His action needs no material (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_16.htm">XVI</a>).<p> 

This also is taught by divine Scripture as a tenet of faith. <i>I am 
God Almighty, walk before me and be perfect</i> (Gen. xvii, 1): <i>I 
know that thou canst do all things</i> (Job xlii, 2): <i>No word shall 
be impossible with God</i> (Luke i, 37).<p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of sundry philosophers, who have laid it 
down that God can do nothing except according to the course of nature. 
On such it is said: <i>As though the Almighty had no power, they 
reckoned of him</i> (Job xxii, 17).<p>
