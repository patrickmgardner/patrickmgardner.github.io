<H1>Solution of Arguments against Creation<A HREF="gc2_18a.htm">*</a></h1>

Hence appears the futility of arguments against creation drawn from the 
nature of movement or change, -- as that creation must be in some 
subject, or that non-being must be transmuted into being: for creation 
is not a change, but is the mere dependence of created being on the 
principle by which it is set up, and so comes under the category of 
<i>relation</i>: hence the subject of creation may very well be said to 
be the thing created.<A HREF="gc2_18b.htm">*</a> Nevertheless creation 
is spoken of as a 'change' according to our mode of conceiving it, 
inasmuch as our understanding takes one and the same thing to be now 
non-existent and afterwards existing. If Creation (creaturedom) is a 
relation, it is evidently some sort of reality; and this reality is 
neither uncreated, nor created by a further act of creation. For since 
the created effect really depends on the Creator, this relation must be 
a certain reality. Now every reality is brought into being by God; and 
therefore also this reality is brought into being by God, and yet was 
not created by any other creation than that of the first creature, 
because accidents and forms do not exist by themselves, and therefore 
neither are they terms of separate creation, since creation is the 
production of substantial being; but as they are 'in another,' so are 
they created in the creation of other things.<p>
