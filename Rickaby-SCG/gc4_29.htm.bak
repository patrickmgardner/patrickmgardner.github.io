<H1>Of the Error of the Manicheans concerning the Incarnation</h1>

THE Manicheans said that the Son of God took not a real but an apparent 
body; and that the things which He did as man, -- being born, eating, 
drinking, walking, suffering, and being buried, -- were not done in 
reality, but in show. To begin with, this theory robs Scripture of all 
authority. For since a show of flesh is not flesh, nor a show of 
walking walking, the Scripture lies when it says, <i>The Word was made 
flesh</i>, if the flesh was only apparent: it lies when it says that 
Jesus Christ walked, ate, was dead and buried, if these things happened 
only in fantastic appearance. But if even in a small matter the 
authority of Holy Scripture is derogated from,<A 
HREF="gc4_29a.htm">*</a> no point of our faith can any longer remain 
fixed, as our faith rests on the Holy Scripture, according to the text, 
<i>These things are written that ye may believe</i> (John xx, 31).<p> 

Some one may say that the veracity of Holy Scripture in relating 
appearance for reality is saved by this consideration, that the 
appearances of things are called figuratively and in a sense by the 
names of the things themselves, as a painted man is called in a sense a 
man. But though this is true, yet it is not the way of Holy Scripture 
to give the whole history of one transaction in this ambiguous way, 
without there being other passages of Holy Scripture from whence the 
truth may be manifestly gathered. Otherwise there would follow, not the 
instruction but the deception of men: whereas the Apostle says that 
<i>whatsoever things are written, are written for our instruction</i> 
(Rom. xv, 4); and that <i>all Scripture, divinely inspired, is useful 
for teaching and instructing</i> (2 Tim. iii, 16). Besides, the whole 
gospel narrative would be poetical and fabulous, if it narrated 
appearances of things for realities, whereas it is said: <i>We have not 
been led by sophisticated fables in making known to you the power of 
our Lord Jesus Christ</i> (2 Peter i, 16). Wherever Scripture has to 
tell of appearances, it gives us to understand this by the very style 
of the narrative, e.g., the apparition of the three men to Abraham, who 
in them adored God and confessed the Deity (Gen. xviii). As for the 
visions of the imagination (<i>imaginarie visa</i>) seen by Isaias, 
Ezechiel, and other prophets, they originate no error, because they are 
not narrated as history, but as prophetic pictures: still there is 
always something put in to show that it is but an apparition (Isai. vi, 
1: Ezech. i, 4: viii, 3).<p> 

When divine truths are conveyed in Scripture under figurative language, 
no error can thence arise, as well from the homely character of the 
similitudes used, which shows that they are but similitudes; as also 
because what in some places is hidden under similitudes, in others is 
revealed by plain speaking. But there is no Scripture authority to 
derogate from the literal truth of all that we read about the humanity 
of Christ. When the Apostle says: <i>God sent his Son in the likeness 
of sinful flesh</i> (Rom. viii, 3): he does not say, <i>in the likeness 
flesh</i>, but adds <i>sinful</i>, since Christ had true flesh, but not 
sinful flesh, there being no sin in Him; but His flesh was like sinful 
flesh, inasmuch as He had flesh liable to suffering, as man's flesh was 
rendered liable by sin. So the expression, <i>made in the likeness of 
men</i> (Phil. ii, 7), conveys no idea of illusion: that is shown by 
what follows, <i>taking the form of a servant</i>, where 'form' is 
clearly put for 'nature,' as the adjoining clause shows, <i>being in 
the form of God</i>: for it is not supposed that Christ was God only in 
resemblance.<A HREF="gc4_29b.htm">*</a><p>

Moreover there are passages in which Holy Scripture expressly bars the 
suspicion of Christ being a mere appearance, Matt. xiv, 26, 27: Luke 
xxiv, 37-39: Acts x, 40, 41: and St John's words, <i>What was from the 
beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we 
have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word of life</i> 
(1 John i, 1). In fact, if Christ had not a real body, He did not 
really die; neither therefore did he really rise again: <i>And if 
Christ be 
not risen again, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also 
vain, yea and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have given 
testimony of God that he hath raised up Christ, whom he hath not raised 
up</i> [if He never really died] (1 Cor. xv, 14, 15).
