A well-known difficulty arises from this chapter. If pure spirits 
and disembodied souls, for there is question of both here, have a 
natural desire of seeing the substance, essence, or what Holy Writ 
calls the face of God, which sight is called by theologians the 
'beatific vision'; and this natural desire of the beatific vision 
points to a corresponding possibility of realisation; then either this 
vision can be attained by natural means, a piece of ultra-Pelagianism 
which St Thomas is the first to repudiate (Chapp. LII, LIII); or men 
and angels, as such, require to be raised to the supernatural state, 
and could never possibly have been left by God to the mere intrinsic 
powers of their nature,  a position virtually Pelagian, as making grace 
a requisite of nature, -- a position formally condemned by the Church 
in Baius (Michael Le Bay of Louvain) and Jansenius, and rejected by all 
modern Catholic theologians, who insist on the absolute possibility of 
what they call a 'state of pure (mere) nature.' Three Popes, in 1567, 
1579, 1641, condemned this proposition of Baius: "It is an opinion 
excogitated by vain and otiose men, according to the folly of 
philosophers, that man in his first origin was the recipient of gifts 
superadded to his nature, and so was elevated by the divine bounty and 
adopted to be a son of God." Baius meant that these gifts of adoption 
and sonship were proper to human nature. Again this saying of Quesnel 
is condemned in the Bull Unigenitus of 1713: "The grace of God is a 
consequence of nature, and was due to nature sound and whole." This 
matter is lucidly explained in Father Harper's <i>Peace through the 
Truth</i>, First Series, pp. 293-296. I have written upon the subject, 
<i>Ethics and Natural Law</i>, pp. 21-25; <i>Oxford and Cambridge 
Conferences</i>, First Series, pp. 211--217, 253-257.<p> 

But how deliver St Thomas from the dilemma? The usual escape is by 
saying that he writes, not of human souls and angels as they are from 
the pure view of philosophy, <i>in puris naturalibus</i>, but as they 
actually are in the historical order of Providence, elevated to the 
supernatural state, destined and fitted by God's gratuitous bounty to 
see Him ultimately face to face. But the Saint's arguments in this 
chapter are purely rational and philosophical, containing not the 
slightest reference to any fact presupposed from revelation.<p> 

Or shall we say that he deals only in <b>eikota</b>, arguments of 
congruity, but not of necessity, or as he says (B. I, Ch. <A 
HREF="gc1_9.htm">IX</a>), <i>rationes verisimiles ad fidelium 
exercitium et consolationem</i>? Against this interpretation it is to 
be considered that the chapter is an essential link in a long chain of 
arguments (Chapp. XXVI-LIV) evidently meant for a demonstrated theory 
of happiness.<p> 

I think we should consider what St Thomas would have said to the 
following reply to the argumentation of this chapter.<p> 

<i>There is no natural desire of that which created nature, as such, is 
not capable of attaining in any shape or form.<p> 

But created nature, as such, is not capable of attaining, in any shape 
or form to the vision of God face to face: therefore.</i><p> 

This difficulty I doubt if St Thomas ever raised to himself, or had 
brought before him. It came into prominence three or four centuries 
later in the disputes with Baius and Jansenius. Had St Thomas been 
confronted with it, I am confident that he would have met it as 
Catholic theologians now do. He would have acknowledged that angels and 
human spirits, in their mere natural condition, would find satisfaction 
and perfect natural happiness in a vision of God mediate and indirect. 
He might possibly still argue a certain congruity in such intelligent 
creatures being raised to the supernatural state and made capable of 
seeing God. He might and he might not, for such elevation is a 
stupendous advance upon nature; and the vision of God, but for its 
being a revealed fact, would be beyond any creature's dream. <i>It hath 
not entered into the heart of man to conceive</i> (i Cor. ii, 9). But 
once raised to the supernatural order and endowed with grace, St Thomas 
would argue invincibly that there is no proper happiness for created 
spirits except face to face with the beauty and glory of God.
