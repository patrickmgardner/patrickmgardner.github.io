Of the eternal lot of such as, wilfully sinning
against the light, reject the known truth of their 
Saviour, there never can he any doubt. The doubt and
difficulty begins when we turn to others, who never
have heard of Christ, or who, however much they
have heard of Him, never seem to have gathered
tidings sufficient and adequate to their minds. Their
situation, to the Christian thinker who mixes in
modern life and knows men, is one of the darkest
regions of his theology. He can but fall back on his
Lord's precept: <i>Judge not</i> (Matt. vii, 1).<p>

On the dichotomy, Matt. xxv, 31-46, I quote
<i>Scripture Manuals for Catholic Schools, St Matthew</i>,
pp. 212-3: "But why is no mention made of faith,
a condition of salvation upon which our Saviour and
His apostles otherwise insist so strongly? Probably
Lactantius and Origen are right in their conjecture,
that though the Saviour of all is likewise judge of all
(Acts xvii, 31), and will gather <i>all nations</i> (v. 32) 
before His judgement-seat, yet the sheep and goats here
particularised are good and bad Christians. The heathen 
who contumaciously reject Christ are already
judged and condemned (John iii, 18: Mark xvi, 16). Of
the heathens to whom Christ has not been preached,
we get no information here."<p>

St Thomas himself habitually views the Christian
in every man; and hardly conceives, still less can be
considered here to discuss, the position of him who
is not a Christian and a Catholic.
