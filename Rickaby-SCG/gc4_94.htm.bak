Of the Immutability of the Will of Souls detained in Purgatory

BUT because there are souls which in the instant of their parting do 
not arrive at happiness, and yet are not damned, we must show that even 
these souls cannot change their purpose after parting from their 
bodies; and the proof is this: -- the souls of the blessed and of the 
lost have their will immutably fixed according to the end to which they 
have adhered. But the souls that carry with them into the next world 
some matter for purgatory are not ultimately in a different case from 
the blessed, for they die in charity, whereby we adhere to God as to 
our last end. Therefore they too will have their will immutably fixed.
