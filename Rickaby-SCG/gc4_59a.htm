Of God and His Creatures</a><hr><p> I fear, this definition can hardly 
stand. It contradicts the now established axiom, <i>Omne vivum ex 
vivo</i>, and we may add, <i>per vivum</i>. If the generative products 
were themselves dead matter, no life could come out of them. Generation 
is now recognised as a mode of growth of living things. In baptism 
indeed the soul comes to be spiritually alive from being spiritually 
dead: in the order of grace it is brought from not living to living: 
but that is more like resurrection than generation. Hence in Romans vi, 
3-11; Ephesians ii, 5, 6; baptism is compared to resurrection from the 
dead. But the transition in thought is easy from resurrection to new 
life, and from new life to new birth, or regeneration. Hence baptism is 
called the sacrament of regeneration. Cf. John iii, 3-5; Titus iii, 5; 
1 Pet. i, 3.<p>
