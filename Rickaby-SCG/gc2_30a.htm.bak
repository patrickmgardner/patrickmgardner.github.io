By "beings in which there is no matter," St Thomas meant pure 
spirits. By "beings in which the matter is not open to receive another 
form," he meant the heavenly bodies: if he had written in our time, he 
might be well taken to mean those primitive atoms or molecules, which 
have been termed "the building stones of the universe." He has in his 
eye the whole class of natural objects, animate and inanimate, that can 
neither destroy themselves nor ever be destroyed and broken up by any 
of the ordinary processes of nature, but are permanent from age to age, 
whether existing apart or in composition. In the physical order, of 
which St Thomas here speaks, the existence of these beings is 
"absolutely necessary"; no physical force can destroy them. One might 
say the same of the total store of energy in the universe, according to 
the principle of the 'conservation of energy.'  St Thomas's 
acquaintance with Plato was through the Neo-Platonists; and their 
favourite Dialogue was the <i>Timaeus</i>, the following passage of 
which (<i>Tim.</i> 41) well illustrates his meaning. The Platonic 
Demiurge is addressing the minor deities whom he has compounded, them 
and their offspring: "Ye gods, god born, works of my fatherhood and 
constructive power, what has been made by me is indissoluble, so long 
as it has my consent to its being. Whatever is bound and put together 
may indeed be loosened: but it were ill done to undo a work fairly 
compacted and well made. Therefore, made as ye are, ye are not 
absolutely beyond death and dissolution: still ye shall never be 
dissolved nor meet the doom of death, finding in my will a tie greater 
even and more potent than the ties wherewith your being was originally 
bound together."
