When the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland knights
a man, he may be said to 'act as King,' i.e., for the
King. Similarly St Thomas says that what a priest
knows by the confessional, he 'knows as God' (<i>scit ut
Deus, Sum. Theol. Supplem.</i> q. 11, art. 5). The 
Christian Priesthood is a development of the Incarnation.
To rail at the former is to forget the latter. Clear your
mind of Nestorianism ere you attack Sacerdotalism.<p>
