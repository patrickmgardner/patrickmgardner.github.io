Few modern readers, I fear, will read this explanation 
with the same zest which St Thomas evidently felt in 
writing it.  Kantian idealism on the one hand, and 
physical science on the other, have averted the modern 
mind -- is it for ever? -- from <i>species 
intelligibilis</i> and <i>intentio intellecta</i>, or 
<i>verbum mentale</i>.  Accidents, scientifically considered, 
as colour, odour, shape, are not to us what they were to 
the mediaeval schoolman. We busy ourselves with the 
sensation of colour, the effect on retina and brain and 
inner consciousness, and further with the vibrations 
from without that are apt to set up such a sensation in 
a creature organised as man is. And at the back of 
colour we discern with the mind's eye, what the bodily 
eye is insensible to, a colourless, invisible molecular 
structure, and a complication of interacting forces all 
but infinite in multitude, all but infinitesimal in 
power. Whoever would rehabilitate Thomist philosophy to 
the requirements of modern science, has before him work 
for a lifetime, no old man's labour. One thing however I 
will say about the 'likeness' (<i>similitudo</i>) here 
said to obtain between the thing in itself and our 
impression or idea of the thing. There can be no 
question here of any such likeness as obtains between a 
portrait, or photograph, and the person who sits for it. 
What can be maintained on behalf of Realistic Dualism is 
this, that between the impression or idea in 
consciousness and the thing in itself there is a certain 
correlation or proportion, inasmuch as the thing in 
itself, striking our senses and thereby our 
understanding, is apt to induce in us certain sensations 
and consequent ideas. These aptitudes, or 
potentialities, relative to man, are the objective 
properties, or accidents, of the thing in itself as 
cognizable by man. This doctrine is simply an extension 
to all substance of a conclusion generally received in 
respect to those interesting substances whom we call our 
friends and acquaintances. We have impressions and ideas 
of them, gathered from their conversation and their 
dealings with us.  We trust that our friends are at 
heart such as their conversation represents them. If 
they are not, they are false and deceitful, or at least 
unknowable and unlovable persons; and there is an end of 
friendship. But assuming that our fellow-men, or some of 
them, as things in themselves, answer to our impressions 
and ideas of them, what of horses and dogs, and the 
lower sentient creation generally? What again of plants, 
of minerals and gases? Are they not all so many 
potential energies, to some extent impressing us, but in 
great measure beyond us, and even when away from us 
still real? And in the ascending scale, what of angels 
and of God? These are interesting questions to all 
except the solipsist. Abandon solipsism, and any extreme 
form of idealism becomes impossible; nay, it may be 
found necessary to come to terms with Realistic Dualism. 
Does not monism spell solipsism?<P>

I have translated <i>similitudo</i> 'likeness,' but the 
intelligent reader will take it to mean no more than 
'proportion,' or 'correspondence,' of the impression or 
idea in the mind with the thing in itself.  'Things in 
themselves' are knowable in point of their aptitudes in 
our regard, aptitudes which remain potential, and do not 
drop to zero, when not exercised.  If any one will 
venture on the fatal denial of potentiality, and assume 
that, as in God, so also in the creatures of God, nothing 
is but what is actualised, no logic can save him from the 
last excesses of pantheism.
