So St Thomas rightly explains, <b>esti men homoi&ocirc;s kai tote 
dunamei p&ocirc;s, ou m&ecirc;n homoi&ocirc;s kai prin mathein &ecirc; 
eurein</b> (<i>De anima</i>, III, iv, 7). When you know a thing, though 
you are not thinking of it, your mind is not quite so much in 
potentiality over that thing as when you have it still to learn.
