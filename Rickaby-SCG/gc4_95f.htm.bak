Concerning angels' wills, good and bad, St Thomas writes (<i>Sum. 
Theol.</i> I, q. 64, art. 2):<p> 

"Appetitive power is proportioned to apprehensive. 
Now an angel's apprehension differs from a man's
in this, that the angel apprehends a thing at a glance,
by one fixed intuition; man by a course of reasoning,
inclining him to opposite conclusions. Hence man's
will adheres to an object unsteadily, but an angel's
fixedly and immovably." See above, Chap. 
<A HREF="gc4_55.htm">LV</a>, #4.<p>

Thus naturally there is no repentance for fallen
angels.
