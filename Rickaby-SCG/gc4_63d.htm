Many will find these scholastic explanations harder to accept than 
transubstantiation itself. The dogma is guaranteed by the Catholic 
Church. The explanations of the dogma lie beyond the domain alike of 
faith, of sensible experience, and of physical science. They rest on a 
structure of abstruse metaphysics, into which there enter elements much 
open to debate, as the 'principle of individuation.' At the same time, 
any one who will have it that transubstantiation is philosophically 
absurd, may well be asked whether he has mastered these scholastic 
subtleties, and has his reply ready to dispel them. All that a Catholic 
need care to do is to point out, <A HREF="gc4_67e.htm">as Newman 
does</a>, how by reason of the very obscurity of the subject arguments 
against the possibility of transubstantiation cannot be cogent and 
apodictic. We are not bound to have forthcoming positive evidence of 
that possibility. We take the <i>fact</i> from the teaching of the 
Church, and leave the <i>how</i> to God. When physical science has said 
its last word on the constitution of matter; when psychology and 
metaphysics have finally disposed of substance and accident, 'things in 
themselves' and phenomena; we shall then be not quite so ill equipped 
as we are at present for speculating on the philosophy of 
transubstantiation.<p> 

Meanwhile, one important point seems to have escaped notice. Faith does 
not raise the question of <i>any</i> substance being converted into 
<i>any other</i> substance, but only of the substances of bread and 
wine being converted into the substance of the Body and Blood of 
Christ. Now the Body and Blood of Christ are the Body and Blood of God, 
and consequently hold a unique position among substances. God's Body 
may well 'supercomprehend,' so to speak, all lower material substances; 
and be able, after unseating any of them from the throne where it sits 
queen, surrounded by attendant accidents, itself occupy that same 
throne in the midst of those same accidents. We cannot safely conclude 
thereupon that any other material substance is capable of doing the 
like. It does not follow, to borrow St Thomas's own illustration, that 
because bread and wine can be changed into the Body and Blood of 
Christ, therefore, of my two fingers, one can be changed into the 
other. Of the intrinsic possibility of this latter conversion, -- and 
not even God can effect intrinsic impossibilities, -- I confess I 
entertain the gravest doubts. And Catholic faith allows me to doubt it. 
Vasquez (tom. 3, disp. 184) discusses <i>an quaelibet res in quamlibet 
aliam converti possit</i>.
