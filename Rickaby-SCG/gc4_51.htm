<h1>Arguments against Original Sin, with Replies</h1>

CHAP. LII -- Before dealing with objections, we must premise that there 
are apparent in mankind certain probable signs of original sin, as we 
can argue fault from penalty. Now the human race generally suffers 
various penalties, corporal and spiritual. Among corporal penalties the 
chief is death, to which all the others lead up, as hunger, thirst, and 
the like. Among spiritual penalties the chief is the weak hold that 
reason takes of man, so that man with difficulty arrives at the 
knowledge of truth, easily falls into error, and cannot altogether 
surmount his bestial appetites, but often has his mind clouded by them. 
Some one may say that these defects, corporal and spiritual, are not 
penal, but natural. But looking at the thing rightly, and supposing 
divine providence, which to all varieties of perfection has adapted 
subjects apt to take up each variety,<A HREF="gc4_51a.htm">*</a> we may 
form a fairly probable conjecture that God, in uniting the higher 
nature of the soul to the lower nature of the body, had the intention 
that the former should control the latter; and further intended to 
remove, by His special and supernatural providence, any impediment to 
such control arising out of any defect of nature. Thus, as the rational 
soul is of a higher nature than the body, it might be supposed that 
such would be the terms of the union of the soul with the body, that 
nothing could possibly be in the body contrary to the soul whereby the 
body lives; and in like manner, as reason in man is associated with 
sensitive appetite and other sensitive powers, it might be expected 
that reason would not be hampered by those sensitive powers, but rather 
would rule them. In accordance with these natural anticipations, we lay 
it down, according to the doctrine of faith, that the original 
constitution of man was such that, so long as his reason was subject to 
God, his lower faculties served him without demur, and no bodily 
impediment could stand in the way of his body obeying him, God and His 
grace supplying whatever was wanting in nature to the achievement of 
this result. But when his reason turned away from God, his lower powers 
revolted from reason; and his body became subject to passions contrary 
to the [rational] life that is by the soul. Thus then, though it may be 
admitted that these defects are natural, if we look at human nature on 
its lower side; nevertheless, if we consider divine providence and the 
dignity of the higher portion of human nature, we have a fairly 
probable ground for arguing that these defects are penal. Thus we may 
gather the inference [<i>a priori</i>] that the human race must have been 
infected with some sin from its first origin. Now we may answer the 
arguments to the contrary.<p> 

<i>Arg. 1</i>. <i>The son shall not bear the iniquity of his father</i> 
(Ezech. xviii, 20).<p>

<i>Reply 1</i>. There is a difference between what affects one 
individual and what affects the nature of a whole species: for by 
partaking in the species many men are as one man, as Porphyry says. The 
sin then that belongs to one individual is not imputable to another 
individual, unless he sins too, because the one is personally distinct 
from the other. But any sin touching the specific nature itself may 
without difficulty be propagated from one to another, as the specific 
nature is imparted by one to others [by generation].<A 
HREF="gc4_51b.htm">*</a> Since sin is an evil of rational nature, and 
evil is a privation of good, we must consider of what good the 
privation is, in order to decide whether the sin in question belongs to 
our common nature, or is the particular sin of a private individual. 
The actual sins then, that are commonly committed by men, take away 
some good from the person of the sinner, such as grace and the due 
order of the parts of his soul: hence they are personal, and not 
imputable to a second party beyond the one person of the sinner. But 
the first sin of the first man not only robbed the sinner of his 
private and personal good, namely, grace and the due order of his soul, 
but also took away a good that belonged to the common nature of 
mankind. According to the original constitution of this nature, the 
lower powers were perfectly subject to reason, reason to God, and the 
body to the soul, God supplying by grace what was wanting to this 
perfection by nature. This benefit, which by some is called 'original 
justice,'<A HREF="gc4_51c.htm">*</a> was conferred on the first man in 
such sort that it should be propagated by him to posterity along with 
human nature. But when by the sin of the first man reason withdrew from 
its subjection to God, the consequence was a loss of the perfect 
subjection of the lower powers to reason, and of the body to the soul, 
-- and that not only in the first sinner, but the same common defect 
has come down to posterity, to whom original justice would otherwise 
have descended. Thus then the sin of the first man, from whom, 
according to the doctrine of faith, all other men are descended, was at 
once a <i>personal</i> sin, inasmuch as it deprived that first man of 
his own private good, and also a sin <i>of nature</i> (<i>peccatum 
naturale</i>), inasmuch as it took away from that man, and consequently 
from his posterity, a benefit conferred upon the whole of human 
nature.<A HREF="gc4_51d.htm">*</a> This defect, entailed upon other men 
by their first parent, has in those other men the character of a fault, 
inasmuch as all men are counted one man hy participation in a common 
nature. This sin is voluntary by the will of our first parent, as the 
action of the hand has the character of a fault from the will of the 
prime mover, reason. In a <i>sin of nature</i> different men are 
counted parts of a common nature, like the different parts of one man 
in a <i>personal sin</i>.<A HREF="gc4_51e.htm">*</a><p> 

<i>Arg. 5</i>. What is natural is no sin, as it is not the mole's fault for 
being blind.<p> 

<i>Reply 5</i>. The defects above mentioned are transmitted by natural 
origin, inasmuch as nature is destitute of the aid of grace, which had 
been conferred upon nature in our first parent, and was meant to pass 
from him to posterity along with nature; and, inasmuch as this 
destitution has arisen from a voluntary sin, the defect so consequent 
comes to bear the character of a fault. Thus these defects are at once 
<i>culpable</i>, as referred to their first principle, which is the sin 
of Adam; and <i>natural</i>, as referred to a nature now destitute [of 
original justice].<p> 

<i>Arg. 6</i>. A defect in a work of nature happens only through defect of
some natural principle.<p>

<i>Reply 6</i>. There is a defect of principle, namely, of the 
gratuitous gift bestowed on human nature in its first creation; which 
gift was in a manner 'natural,' not that it was caused by the 
principles of nature, but because it was given to man to be propagated 
along with his nature.<p> 

<i>Arg. 9</i>. The good of nature is not taken away by sin: hence even 
in devils their natural excellences remain. Therefore the origin of 
human generation, which is an act of nature, cannot have been vitiated 
by sin.<p> 

<i>Reply 9</i>. By sin there is not taken away from man the good of 
nature which belongs to his natural species, but a good of nature which 
was superadded by grace.<A HREF="gc4_51f.htm">*</a><p> 

10. The gift, not belonging to the essence of the species, was 
nevertheless bestowed by God gratuitously on the first man, that from 
him it might pass to the entire species: in like manner the sin, which 
is the privation of that gift, passes to the entire species.<p> 

11. Though by the sacraments of grace one is so cleansed from original 
sin that it is not imputed to him as a fault, -- and this is what is 
meant by saying that he is <i>personally</i> delivered from that sin, 
-- yet he is not altogether healed;<A HREF="gc4_51g.htm">*</a> and 
therefore by the act of <i>nature</i> [i.e., of generation] original 
sin is transmitted to his posterity. Thus then in the human procreant, 
considered as a person, there is no original sin; and there may very 
well be no actual sin in the act of procreation: still, inasmuch as the 
procreant is a natural principle of procreation, the infection of 
original sin, as regards the nature, remains in him and in his 
procreative act.<A HREF="gc4_51h.htm">*</a><p>
