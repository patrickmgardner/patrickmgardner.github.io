<H1>The Function of the Wise Man</h1>

<i>My mouth shall discuss truth, and my lips shall detest the
ungodly</i> (Prov. vii,7). <P>
 
ACCORDING to established popular usage, which the Philosopher
considers should be our guide in the naming of things, they are
called 'wise' who put things in their right<A
HREF="gc1_1a.htm">*</a> order and control them well.  Now, in all
things that are to be controlled and put in order to an end, the
measure of control and order must be taken from the end in view;
and the proper end of everything is something good.  Hence we see
in the arts that art A governs and, as it were, lords it over art
B, when the proper end of art B belongs to A.<A
HREF="gc1_1b.htm">*</a>  Thus the art of medicine lords it over the
art of the apothecary, because health, the object of medicine, is
the end of all drugs that the apothecary's art compounds.  These
arts that lord it over others are called 'master-building,' or
'masterful arts'; and the 'master-builders' who practise them
arrogate to themselves the name of 'wise men.' But because these
persons deal with the ends in view of certain particular things,
without attaining to the general end of all things, they are
called 'wise in this or that particular thing,' as it is said,
'As a wise architect I have laid the foundation' (I Cor. iii,
10); while the name of 'wise' without qualification is reserved
for him alone who deals with the last end of the universe, which
is also the first beginning of the order of the universe.  Hence,
according to the Philosopher, it is proper to the wise man to
consider the highest causes.<P>
 
     Now the last end of everything is that which is intended by
the prime author or mover thereof.  The prime author and mover of
the universe is intelligence, as will be shown later (B. II,
Chap.  XXIII, XXIV).  Therefore the last end of the universe must
be the good of the intelligence, and that is truth.  Truth then
must be the final end of the whole universe; and about the
consideration of that end<A HREF="gc1_1c.htm">*</a> wisdom must
primarily be concerned.  And therefore the Divine Wisdom, clothed
in flesh, testifies that He came into the world for the
manifestation of truth: <i>For this was I born, and unto this I
came into the World, to give testimony to the truth</i> (John
xvii, 37).  The Philosopher also rules that the first philosophy
is the science of truth, not of any and every truth, but of that
truth which is the origin of all truth, and appertains to the
first principle of the being of all things; hence its truth is
the principle of all truth, for things are in truth as they are
in being.<P>
 
     It is one and the same function to embrace either of two
contraries and to repel the other.  Hence, as it is the function
of the wise man to discuss truth, particularly of the first
beginning, so it is his also to impugn the contrary error. 
Suitably therefore is the double function of the wise man
displayed in the words above quoted from the Sapiential Book,
namely, to study, and upon study to speak out the truth of God,
which of all other is most properly called truth, and this is
referred to in the words, <i>My mouth shall discuss truth</i>,
and to impugn error contrary to truth, as referred to in the
words, <i>And my lips shall detest the ungodly</i>.
