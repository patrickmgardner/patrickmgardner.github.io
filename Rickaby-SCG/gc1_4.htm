<H1>That it is an advantage for the Truths of God, known
by Natural Reason, to be proposed to men to be believed on faith</h1>

IF a truth of this nature were left to the sole enquiry of reason, 
three disadvantages would follow. One is that the knowledge of God 
would be confined to few. The discovery of truth is the fruit of 
studious enquiry. From this very many are hindered. Some are hindered 
by a constitutional unfitness, their natures being ill-disposed to the 
acquisition of knowledge. They could never arrive by study to the 
highest grade of human knowledge, which consists in the knowledge of 
God. Others are hindered by the needs of business and the ties of the 
management of property. There must be in human society some men devoted 
to temporal affairs. These could not possibly spend time enough in the 
learned lessons of speculative enquiry to arrive at the highest point 
of human enquiry, the knowledge of God. Some again are hindered by 
sloth. The knowledge of the truths that reason can investigate 
concerning God presupposes much previous knowledge. Indeed almost the 
entire study of philosophy is directed to the knowledge of God.  Hence, 
of all parts of philosophy, that part stands over to be learnt last, 
which consists of metaphysics dealing with points of Divinity.<A 
HREF="gc1_4a.htm">*</a> Thus, only with great labour of study is it 
possible to arrive at the searching out of the aforesaid truth; and 
this labour few are willing to undergo for sheer love of knowledge. 
Another disadvantage is that such as did arrive at the knowledge or 
discovery of the aforesaid truth would take a long time over it, on 
account of the profundity of such truth, and the many prerequisites to 
the study, and also because in youth and early manhood, the soul, 
tossed to and fro on the waves of passion, is not fit for the study of 
such high truth: only in settled age does the soul become prudent and 
scientific, as the Philosopher says. Thus, if the only way open to the 
knowledge of God were the way of reason, the human race would dwell 
long in thick darkness of ignorance: as the knowledge of God, the best 
instrument for making men perfect and good, would accrue only to a few, 
and to those few after a considerable lapse of time.<P> 

A third disadvantage is that, owing to the infirmity of our judgement 
and the perturbing force of imagination, there is some admixture of 
error in most of the investigations of human reason.  This would be a 
reason to many for continuing to doubt even of the most accurate 
demonstrations, not perceiving the force of the demonstration, and 
seeing the divers judgements of divers persons who have the name of 
being wise men. Besides, in the midst of much demonstrated truth there 
is sometimes an element of error, not demonstrated but asserted on the 
strength of some plausible and sophistic reasoning that is taken for a 
demonstration. And therefore it was necessary for the real truth 
concerning divine things to be presented to men with fixed certainty by 
way of faith. Wholesome therefore is the arrangement of divine 
clemency, whereby things even that reason can investigate are commanded 
to be held on faith, so that all might easily be partakers of the 
knowledge of God, and that without doubt and error.<A 
HREF="gc1_4b.htm">*</a> Hence it is said: <i>Now ye walk not as the 
Gentiles walk in the vanity of their own notions, having the 
understanding darkened</i> (Eph. iv, 17, 18); and, <i>I will make all 
thy sons taught of the Lord</i> (Isa. liv, 1, 5).
