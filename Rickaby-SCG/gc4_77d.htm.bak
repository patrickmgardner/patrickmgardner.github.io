This was one of the tenets of the then rising sect of the Fraticelli 
(Denzinger, <i>Enchiridion</i>, nn. 413, 414), repeated by Wycliffe: "If 
bishop or priest be in mortal sin, he neither ordains nor consecrates 
nor baptises" (ib. n. 480). It would be as wise to hold that all good 
men can sign cheques, and no bad men. To this day that notion is not 
uncommon in England that a Romish priest claims to absolve from sin 
in virtue of his own superabundant personal sanctity.
