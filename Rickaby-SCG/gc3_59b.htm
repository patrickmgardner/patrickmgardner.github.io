By 'seeing all things that belong to the perfection
of the universe,' St Thomas would mean, in modern
terminology, 'having a comprehensive scientific view
of the universe as a whole': this would include
knowledge of the constitution of matter, and of its
working arrangements, molar and molecular; and
understanding of electricity, of gravitation, of 
vegetable and animal life, of the genesis of nebulae and
stars, of the origin of species, animal and vegetable,
of the workings of the mind, such as free will. A very
wonderful knowledge, but much less wonderful than
the vision of God.
