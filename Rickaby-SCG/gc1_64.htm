<H1>A list of things to be said concerning the Divine Knowledge</h1>

TO the exclusion of the above error we will show first that the divine
mind does know individual things; secondly, that it knows things
which actually are not; thirdly, that it knows future contingencies
with infallible knowledge; fourthly, that it knows the motions of the will;
fifthly, that it knows infinite things; sixthly, that it knows the vilest and
least of things that be; seventhly, that it knows evils and all manner of 
privations or defects.
