God is mere and sheer existence, not existence
modelled upon some quiddity 
<A HREF="gc1_22.htm">(Chap. XXII)</a>. In this
study it should be borne in mind that 'essence' 
represents the ideal order: 'existence' the actual. God
is the unity of essence and existence, of the ideal and
the actual; the point at which the potential finally
vanishes into the actual. In every existent being,
under God, there is an admixture of potentiality.  
This is to be kept steadily in view in bringing St
Thomas to bear upon Kant and Hegel.
