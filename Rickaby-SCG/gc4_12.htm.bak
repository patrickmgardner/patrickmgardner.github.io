<H1>How the Son of God is called the Wisdom of God</h1>

WISDOM in man is a habit whereby our mind is perfected in the knowledge 
of the highest truths: such are divine truths. Wisdom in God is His 
knowledge of Himself. But because He does not know Himself by any 
presentation of Himself other than His essence, and His act of 
understanding is His essence, the wisdom of God cannot be a habit, but 
is the very essence of God. But the Son of God is the Word and Concept 
of God understanding Himself. The Word of God, thus conceived, is 
properly called 'begotten Wisdom': -- hence the Apostle names Christ 
the <i>wisdom of God</i> (1 Cor. i, 24). This Word of wisdom, conceived 
in the mind, is a manifestation of the wisdom of the mind which thereby 
understands: as in us acts are a manifestation of habits. Also the 
divine wisdom is called 'light,' as consisting in a pure act of 
knowledge; and the manifestation of light is the brightness thence 
proceeding: the Word of divine wisdom therefore is fittingly called the 
'brightness of light,' according to the text: <i>being the brightness 
of his glory</i> (Heb. i, 3).<A HREF="gc4_12a.htm">*</a> But though the 
Son, or Word of God, is properly called 'conceived wisdom,' 
nevertheless the name of Wisdom, when used absolutely, must be common 
to the Father and the Son; since the wisdom that is resplendent through 
the Word is the essence of the Father, and the essence of the Father is 
common to Him with the Son.
