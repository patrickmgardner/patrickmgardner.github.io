Mathematical calculations are irrespective of time: they deal with the 
'essences of things,' which are timeless, as Aristotle says of the 
relation of the diagonal to the side of the square: time makes no 
difference in that relation. But when an engineer comes to apply such 
calculations to practical work, he re-enters upon considerations of 
time and place. The affirmative and negative judgements spoken of in 
the text make accidental propositions: now accidental propositions 
involve time, e.g., 'there stood a lion in the way': essential 
propositions do not, e.g., 'a lion is an animal of the cat tribe.'
