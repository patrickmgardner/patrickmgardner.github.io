Manicheism, in its essential duality of good and
evil, is much older than Manes. The earliest savages
peopled the earth with spirits, some friendly, some
hostile to man: the reduction of these friendly and
hostile spirits to two several heads, and the neglecting 
to confess one, supreme over good and evil alike,
(cf. Isa. xlv, 6, 7) was the genesis of Manicheism.
