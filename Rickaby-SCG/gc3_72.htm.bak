<H1>That Divine Providence is not inconsistent with an element of 
Contingency in Creation<A HREF="gc3_72a.htm">*</a></h1>

AS divine providence does not exclude all evil from creation, neither 
does it exclude contingency, or impose necessity upon all things. The 
operation of providence does not exclude secondary causes, but is 
fulfilled by them, inasmuch as they act in the power of God. Now 
effects are called 'necessary' or 'contingent' according to their 
proximate causes, not according to their remote causes. Since then 
among proximate causes there are many that may fail, not all effects 
subject to providence will be necessary, but many will be 
contingent.<p> 

6. On the part of divine providence no hindrance will be put to the 
failure of the power of created things, or to an obstacle arising 
through the resistance of something coming in the way. But from such 
failure and such resistance the contingency occurs of a natural cause 
not always acting in the same way, but sometimes failing to do what it 
is naturally competent to do; and so natural effects do not come about 
of necessity.<A HREF="gc3_72b.htm">*</a>
