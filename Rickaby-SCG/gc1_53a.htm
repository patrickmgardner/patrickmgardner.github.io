The 'impression' (<i>species</i>) can come only from the 
thing being present : but the expression (<i>intentio 
rationis</i>, <A HREF="gc1_53a1.htm"><b>logos</b></a>, 
<i>verbum mentale</i>) of the thing endures in the 
understanding when the thing is away.  So too does the 
corresponding phantasia, or sense-picture in the 
imagination, endure in the absence of the object. See 
Father Maher's <i>Psychology</i>, Stonyhurst Series, 
Longmans, ed. 4, pp. 51-53, 310.
