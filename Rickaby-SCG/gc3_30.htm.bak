<h1>That Man's Happiness does not consist in Riches</h1>

RICHES are not desired except for the sake of something else: for of 
themselves they do no good, but only as we use them. But the highest 
good is desired for its own sake, and not for the sake of something 
else.<p> 

2. The possession or preservation of those things cannot be the highest 
good, which benefit man most in being parted with. But such is the use 
of riches, to spend.<p> 

3. The act of liberality and munificence, the virtues that deal with 
money, is more praiseworthy, in that money is parted with, than that 
money is got. Man's happiness therefore does not consist in the 
possession of riches.<A HREF="gc3_30a.htm">*</a><p> 

4. That in the gaining of which man's chief good lies must be some 
thing better than man. But man is better than his riches, which are 
things ordained to his use.<p> 

5. The highest good of man is not subject to fortune: for fortuitous 
events happen without effort of reason, whereas man must gain his 
proper end by reason. But fortune has great place in the gaining of 
riches.<A HREF="gc3_30b.htm">*</a>
