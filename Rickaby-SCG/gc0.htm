<H2>Preface</h2>

SOME years ago, a priest of singularly long and varied 
experience urged me to write "a book about God." He said that
wrong and imperfect notions of God lay at the root of all our
religious difficulties.  Professor Lewis Campbell says the same
thing in his own way in his work, Religion in Greek Literature,
where he declares that the age needs "a new definition of God."
Thinking the need over, I turned to the <i>Summa contra
Gentiles</i>.  I was led to it by the Encyclical of Leo XIII,
<i>Aeterni Patris</i>, urging the study of St Thomas.  A further
motive, quite unexpected, was supplied by the University of
Oxford in 1902 placing the <i>Summa Contra Gentiles</i> on the
list of subjects which a candidate may at his option offer in the
Final Honour School of <i>Literae Humaniores</i>, -- a very
unlikely book to be offered so long as it remains simply as St
Thomas wrote it. Lastly I remembered that I had in 1892 published
under the name of <i>Aquinas Ethicus</i> a translation of the
principal portions of the second part of St Thomas's <i>Summa
Theologica</i>: thus I might be reckoned some thing of an expert
in the difficult art of finding English equivalents for
scholastic Latin.<P> 
 
There are two ways of behaving towards St Thomas's writings,
analogous to two several treatments of a church still standing,
in which the saint might have worshipped.  One way is to hand the
edifice over to some Society for the Preservation of Ancient
Monuments: they will keep it locked to the vulgar, while
admitting some occasional connoisseur: they will do their utmost
to preserve every stone identically the same that the mediaeval
builder laid.  And the <i>Opera Omnia</i> of St Thomas,
handsomely bound, may fill a library shelf, whence a volume is
occasionally taken down for the sole purpose of knowing what St
Thomas said and no more.  Another thirteenth-century church may
stand, a parish church still, in daily use; an ancient monument,
and something besides; a present-day house of prayer, meeting the
needs of a twentieth-century congregation; and for that purpose
refitted, repainted, restored, repaired and modernised; having
had that done to it which its mediaeval architects would have
done, had they lived in our time.  Nothing is more remarkable in
our old English churches than the sturdy self-confidence, and the
good taste also lasting for some centuries, with which each
successive age has superimposed its own style upon the
architecture of its predecessors.  If St Thomas's works are to
serve modern uses, they must pass from their old Latinity into
modern speech: their conclusions must be tested by all the
subtlety of present-day science, physical, psychological,
historical; maintained, wherever maintainable, but altered, where
tenable no longer.  Thus only can St Thomas keep his place as a
living teacher of mankind.<P>

For the history of the <i>Contra Gentiles</i> I refer the
reader to the folio edition printed at the Propaganda Press in 
1878 <i>cura et studio Petri Antonii Uccellii</i>, pp.
xiii-xxxlx.  Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274) came to the University of
Paris in 1245, and there for three years heard the lectures of
Albertus Magnus, taking his Bachelor's degree in 1248.  He
returned to the University in 1253, took his Master's degree in
1257, and thereupon lectured in theology for two or three years,
leaving the University in 1259 or 1260.  He wrote the <i>Summa
contra Gentiles</i> in Italy, under the pontificate of Urban IV
(1261-1264), at the request of St Raymund of Pennafort.  He went
for the third time to the University of Paris in 1269, finally
returning to Italy in 1271.  Though the <i>Summa contra
Gentiles</i> was written in Italy, there is reason to believe
that the substance of it was got together during the Saint's
second residence at Paris, and formed the staple of his lectures
in the University.  The more celebrated <i>Summa Theologica</i>
was a later work.<P>

The <i>Summa contra Gentiles</i> is in the unique position of a
classic whereof the author's manuscript is still in great part
extant.  It is now in the Vatican Library.  The manuscript
consists of strips of parchment, of various shades of colour,
contained in an old parchment cover to which they were originally
stitched.  The writing is in double columns, minute and difficult
to decipher, abounding in abbreviations, often passing into a
kind of shorthand.  Through many passages a line is drawn in sign
of erasure: but these remain not less legible than the rest, and
are printed as foot notes in the Propaganda edition: they do not
appear in the present translation.  To my mind, these erasures
furnish the best proof of the authenticity of the autograph,
which is questioned by S. E. Frett&eacute;, editor of <i>Divi
Thomae Opera Omnia</i> (Viv&egrave;s, Paris, 1874), vol. XII,
preface iv-vi.  An inscription on the cover states that the
manuscript is the autograph of St Thomas, and that it was brought
from Naples to the Dominican convent at Bergamo in 1354: whence
its name of the 'Bergamo autograph.' Many leaves were lost in the
sack of the convent by the armies of the first French Revolution;
and the whole of Book IV is missing.<P>
 
The frequent erasures of the Saint himself lend some
countenance to the omissions of his translator.  Re-reading his
manuscript in the twentieth century, St Thomas would have been
not less ready than he showed himself in the thirteenth century
to fulfil the Horatian precept, saepe stylum vertas.<P>
