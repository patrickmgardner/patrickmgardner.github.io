The theology of the Catholic Church on this
point stands as follows in the light of controversies
and decisions subsequent to the age of St Thomas.<p>

<ul><li>(a) A man in mortal sin may do acts of natural
virtue, such as <i>even the heathen do</i> (Matt. v, 47).<p><p>

<li>(b) He may also do supernaturally good acts by
aid of 'an exterior principle,' i.e., the actual grace
sent him by God. This St Thomas presently 
declares (Chap. CLVII).<p>

<li>(c) These supernatural acts, done by a soul in
deadly sin, need not proceed from fear alone: they
may be motived by hope, by some sense of shame or
gratitude, or even by some initial love of God
(Council of Trent, Sess. 6, Cap. vi).<p>

<li>(d) An act of perfect love of God is excluded by
the supposition of the soul being still in mortal sin:
for when a man in mortal sin is led on by grace to
make such an act, which is possible enough, his sin
is instantly taken away.<p></ul>

Nor is St Thomas in disagreement with these
propositions. See <i>Sum. Theol.</i> 1a-2ae, q. 71, art. 4;
2a-2ae, q. 23, art. 7 ad 1 (<i>Aquinas Ethicus</i>, I, 199,
355).<p>

On the other hand, the Chorch has condemned
the following<p>

<ul><li>(a) Of Michael Le Bay: "Everything that the
sinner, or the state of sin, does is a sin. He is of the
party of Pelagius, who recognises any natural 
goodness, that is, any goodness arising from the mere
power of nature."<p>

<li>(b) Of Paschal Quesnel, the Jansenist: "What
remains to the soul that has lost God and His grace,
but sin and the consequences of sin, a proud poverty
and a lazy indigence, that is, a general incapacity for
labour, prayer, or any good work?" (Denziger, <i>Enchiridion 
Symbolorum et Definitionum</i>, nn. 680, 915, 917, 1216.)</ul>
