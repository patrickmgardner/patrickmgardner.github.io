The workman does not usually make his own tools. This example of the 
workman and his tool, a favourite with St Thomas, goes beyond the 
domain of physical nature, and therefore is in point. But, as I have 
already observed, the instances which physical nature yields are not of 
subordinate, but of co-ordinate action. That prime minister of 
creation, the <i>corpus coeleste</i>, or <i>primum mobile</i>, 
respected and constantly referred to till the end of the sixteenth 
century, has gone finally out of office, and with it the primacy and 
commanding influence of heavenly over earthly bodies. Physical forces 
in the heavens above and on the earth beneath make together a republic, 
not a feudal monarchy.
