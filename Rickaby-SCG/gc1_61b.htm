Man is never out in his intuitions, only in his reasonings: but 
the divine mind is one all-comprehensive intuition.  Such is the 
argument.  But man is out in his intuitions often, when he 
ventures on intuition of complex matter, taking for self-evident 
what is not even true. Next door to the intuitions of a genius 
are the blunders of a fool. An 'error of judgement,' as it is 
called, is not usually a wrong piece of reasoning, but a bad 
attempt at intuition. St Thomas might reply that this comes of 
man attempting intuitions beyond his sphere of vision. But the 
sphere of divine vision embraces all things.
