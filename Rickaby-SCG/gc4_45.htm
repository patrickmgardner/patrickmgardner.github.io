<H1>That Christ was born of  virgin without prejudice to His true and natural Humanity</h1>

GOD'S power being infinite, and all other causes deriving their 
efficacy from that, any effect produced by any cause may be produced by 
God without aid of that cause, and yet be of the same species and 
nature as though it had been produced in the ordinary way. As then the 
natural power of the human semen produces a true man, having the 
species and nature of a man, so the divine power, which has given that 
power to the semen, may produce the effect of that power, without 
calling the cause into activity, and so constitute a true man, having 
the species and nature of a man. Nor is anything lost to the dignity of 
the Mother of Christ by the virgin conception and birth: there is 
nothing in that to prevent her being called the Mother of the Son of 
God: for by the working of divine power she supplied the matter 
physically requisite for the generation of the body of Christ: which is 
all that a mother need do.
