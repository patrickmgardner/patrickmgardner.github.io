Miracles show that physical nature, the cosmos
of necessary cause and effect, is not everything; that
some cause of another order has stept in to alter the
effect from what it would have been, had physical
causes alone operated.  Such a cause is man himself,
much more God. The forces of physical nature,
were they endowed with consciousness, would regard 
all man's manipulation of nature as miraculous:
a house would be a miracle to them or a railway.
Geology does not build railways, nor gravitation
cathedrals. There Mind and Will has come in. God,
too, has Mind and Will and Power, beyond that of
man; and a miracle shows it. A miracle does not
clash with 'nature'; but evidences that what we call
'nature' is not all the power that is. People who
believe in nature, physical nature, and nothing but
physical nature, will not hear of miracles. But what
is there in physical nature to assure them that such
nature is all in all, and that there is nothing beyond it?
