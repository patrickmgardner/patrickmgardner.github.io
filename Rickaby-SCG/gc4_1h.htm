To transfer the remark from physics to another 
domain, -- though we had mastered the whole
of history, how much could we read therein of the
divine counsels and plan of government? In every
direction, does not the universe and man's life in it
grow more puzzling, the more we know of it, if we
seek to trace any exact economy and purpose? Hence
St Thomas argues the need of divine revelation.<p>

We know so much more of the ways of creatures
than was known in St Thomas's time, so much more
of history and antiquities, so much more astronomy,
dynamics, chemistry, molecular physics, biology: has
there been any proportionate increase in our knowledge 
of God? Has theology grown with the growth
of other sciences? The question is one to furnish
matter for a long and curious dissertation, in which
the results, professedly arrived at, would differ widely
according to the various theological preconceptions,
whether of faith or prejudice, with which the several
writers took up their pens. Yet an outline statement
of results may be hazarded. Growth in truth must
surely bring out truth. If theology has gained nothing
by the advance of 'science,' either 'science' or theology 
must be condemned. Theology then has gained
in at least three respects. It has gained in the overthrow 
of superstition, notably astrology and witchcraft. 
It has gained in a better appreciation of
everything which, for want of a better name, I must
call 'vastness' in God, -- His immensity, filling all
stellar space; His incomprehensibility; His all-embracing, 
all-sustaining wisdom; and His tremendous
power. Once more, theology has gained in kindliness.
Harshness and narrowness of sympathy so often
proceed, not from any particular love of truth or
zeal for justice, but simply from want of experience,
-- from the inexperience of a youthful and untravelled
mind. With the weight of past ages upon us, the
youngest of the really educated in our theological
schools is no longer young in the depreciatory sense
of that term. We have found out that men and
women are not the easy subjects of moral dissection
that unpractised eyes take them for. We recognise
the wisdom of the Judge who made proclamation to
the bystanders in court, <i>Judge not</i> (Matt. vii, 1).<p>

Accidentally, a quarrel has arisen between theology 
and modern science. This quarrel marks no
intrinsic opposition: it is the fault of persons.
Revealed theology is essentially a distinct kingdom 
from secular science. But it is a frontier
kingdom; and the two kingdoms cannot but have
relations with one another. These relations have
been unfriendly, not without some fault on both
sides. Theologians have repeated what other theologians 
have said before them, not considering the
advance of physical science, or of history, since the
authors whom they follow lived and wrote. Now if
it were mere matter of dogmatic, or revealed, theology, 
this disregard of physics would be justified; but
when it is question of providing, say, a biological setting
for a theological truth, this neglect of modern progress
in biology becomes deplorable. On the other hand, it
goes without saying that some votaries of physics, or
history, or criticism, cherish an acrimonious hatred
for divine revelation, and even the very name of
God; and chiefly value science as a weapon of offence
against theology, -- thereby assuming a mental attitude 
the reverse of scientific. For the provisional
adjustment of the contested frontier, we seem to
require a sort of boundary commission of physicists,
historians, critics, philosophers, and theologians 
working with one common endeavour, as the Jesuit rule
lays it down, <i>ut suus veritati sit locus, non ut in ea re
superiores videantur</i>. Such a commission would sit 
permanently in a Catholic University, if ever such an
institution could be planted anywhere in the British
Isles.
