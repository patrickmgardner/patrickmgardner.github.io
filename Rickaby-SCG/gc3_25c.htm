Why 'play always' rather than study always?  Our bodily constitution 
unfits us to do either one or the other.  But what St Thomas means is 
that, if play were an end in itself, we should play all we can, which 
sundry men do, -- and boys, if you let them.  The passage is suggested 
by Aristotle, <i>Eth. Nic.</i> X, vi, 6.  St Thomas does not observe 
the delight of the artist in the work of his hands, nor consider how 
few scholars study for study's sake, nor generally how much of pure 
speculative interest is blended with practice, and how much thinking is 
done for material gains.  As Aristotle might have said, <b>to de kai 
the&ocirc;rountes d&ecirc;miourgoumen kai pros l&ecirc;mmata 
the&ocirc;roumen</b>.
