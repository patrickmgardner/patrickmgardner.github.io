Provided it be not essentially incompatible with what was 'put in' 
originally. But if bovine nature be the original endowment, civil 
status and capacity cannot possibly 'impressed' upon that.<p> 

I hope I may insist upon this without disrespect to St Thomas, -- nay, 
without departure from his further and inner mind (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_97.htm">XCVII</a>), here not so clearly expressed, bent as he 
was for the nonce upon explaining the Augustinian quotation with which 
he concludes. In these days, when the great philosophic difficulty 
against theism is the prevalence of evil, it is of the first importance 
to beware of any theistic statement which seems to represent God as 
mere Will, arbitrary, unconditioned, and untrammelled by any regard to 
the eternal fitnesses and possibilities of nature. In the presence of 
evils such as we daily experience, to ally such sheer, imperious, 
overruling and overwhelming Will with Goodness, is a task which one 
shrinks from contemplating. Happily, it is not the task of the 
philosopher and the Christian. No lord paramount <b>thumos</b> or 
<b>boul&ecirc;sis</b> can run counter to the eid&ecirc;. If we might 
put words into the mouth of our Creator, words suggested by our great 
dramatist, we might fancy God saying:<pre>

        I can do all that doth become a God:
        Who can do more, is none.

</pre>That alone 'doth become a God,' which is consonant with the 
<b>eid&ecirc;</b>, or fixed intelligible natures of things, which are 
the expression of His nature as imitable beyond Himself God is "the 
first measure of every being and of every nature" by virtue of what He 
is in Himself in His own being and His own nature, not by mere virtue 
of His will.
