<H1>How a Subsistent Intelligence may be the Form of a Body</h1>

If a subsistent intelligence is not united with a body merely as its 
mover, as Plato thought (<A HREF="gc2_57.htm">Chap. LVII</a>); nor is 
the intellect, whereby man understands, a predisposition in human 
nature, as Alexander said (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_62.htm">LXII</a>; nor a 
temperament, as Galen (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_64b.htm">LXIII</a>); nor a 
harmony, as Empedocles (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_64.htm">LXIV</a>); nor a 
body, nor a sense, nor a phantasy (Chapp. <A HREF="gc2_65.htm">LXV</a>, 
<A HREF="gc2_66.htm">LXVI</a>, <A HREF="gc2_67.htm">LXVII</a>); it 
remains that the human soul is a subsistent intelligence, united with 
the body as its form: which may be thus made manifest.<p> 

There are two requisites for one thing to be the substantial form of 
another. One requisite is that the form be the principle of substantial 
being to that whereof it is the form: I do not mean the 
<i>effective</i>, but the <i>formal</i> principle, whereby a thing is 
and is denominated 'being.'<A HREF="gc2_68a.htm">*</a>  The second 
requisite is that the form and matter should unite in one 'being'; 
namely, in that being wherein the substance so composed subsists.  
There is no such union of the effective principle with that to which it 
gives being.<A HREF="gc2_68b.htm">*</a>  A subsistent intelligence, as 
shown in Chap. <A HREF="gc2_56.htm">LVI</a>, is not hindered by the 
fact that it is subsistent from communicating its being to matter, and 
becoming the formal principle of the said matter.  There is no 
difficulty in the identification of the being, in virtue of which the 
compound subsists, with the form itself of the said compound, since the 
compound is only through the form, and neither subsist apart.<A 
HREF="gc2_68c.htm">*</a><p> 

It may be objected that a subsistent intelligence cannot communicate 
its being to a material body in such a way that there shall be one 
being of the subsistent intelligence and the material body: for things 
of different kinds have different modes of being, and nobler is the 
being of the nobler substance. This objection would be in point, if 
that being were said to belong to that material thing in the same way 
in which it belongs to that subsistent intelligence.  But it is not so: 
for that being belongs to that material body as to a recipient subject 
raised to a higher state; while it belongs to that subsistent 
intelligence as to its principle and by congruence of its own 
nature.<p> 

In this way a wonderful chain of beings is revealed to our study.  The 
lowest member of the higher genus is always found to border close upon 
the highest member of the lower genus.  Thus some of the lowest members 
of the genus of animals attain to little beyond the life of plants, 
certain shellfish for instance, which are motionless, have only the 
sense of touch, and are attached to the ground like plants.  Hence 
Dionysius says: "Divine wisdom has joined the ends of the higher to the 
beginnings of the lower."<A HREF="gc2_68d.htm">*</a>  Thus in the genus 
of bodies we find the human body, composed of elements equally 
tempered, attaining to the lowest member of the class above it, that 
is, to the human soul, which holds the lowest rank in the class of 
subsistent intelligences. Hence the human soul is said to be on the 
horizon and boundry line between things corporeal and incorporeal, 
inasmuch as it is an incorporeal substance and at the same time the 
form of a body.<p> 

Above other forms there is found a form, likened to the supramundane 
substances in point of understanding, and competent to an activity which 
is accomplished without any bodily organ at all; and this is the 
intellectual soul: for the act of understanding is not done through any 
bodily organ.  Hence the intellectual soul cannot be totally 
encompassed by matter, or immersed in it, as other material forms are: 
this is shown by its intellectual activity, wherein bodily matter has 
no share.  The fact however that the very act of understanding in the 
human soul needs certain powers that work through bodily organs, 
namely, phantasy and sense, is a clear proof that the said soul is 
naturally united to the body to make up the human species.<A
