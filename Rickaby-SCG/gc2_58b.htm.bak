In a paragraph here omitted occur these words, which are of interest in 
the discussion of evolution. "The order of the sentient to the 
intelligent, and of the vegetative to the sentient, is as the order of 
potentiality to actuality: for the intelligent is posterior in 
generation to the sentient, and the sentient to the vegetative: for 
animal is prior in generation to man." St Thomas is here describing the 
development of the individual, as Chap. LXXXVI shows, not of the race; 
or what is now called 'ontogenetic' as opposed to 'phylogenetic' 
development.
