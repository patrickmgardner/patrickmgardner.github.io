"A man's intellectual knowledge stands to his sensory knowledge as a 
sculptor chiselling an image out of marble stands to the workmen who 
bring the marble from the quarry.  As the sculptor cannot exercise his 
art on the marble unless the workmen bring it to the quarry, so a man's 
intellect can form no ideas of sensible things unless it has presented 
to it through the external and internal senses sensible images of the 
same.  But as the sculptor alone impresses in the marble brought him 
the idea of something conceived in his mind, so with his intellect 
alone does man form intellectual cognitions," -- i.e. universal 
concepts (B&ouml;dder, <i>Psychologia</i>, pp. 94, 95, translated).  
The intellect then (which must include the rational appetite, the will) 
is a free faculty, inorganic; <b>ch&ocirc;ristos</b> at least in this 
sense, that it does not actualise any body organ, as sight actualises 
the eye; which led Aristotle to say that "were the eye an animal, sight 
would be its soul" (<i>De anima</i>, II, i, 9), as being its 
<b>entelecheia</b>, or form.  But, it may be objected, from this it 
appears that the <b>nous</b>, or the intelligent soul, is not the form 
of the body.  St Thomas would meet this grave objection by laying down, 
as he does (<i>Sum. Theol.</i>, I, q. 77, a. 1), his distinction 
between the faculties and the essence (or substance) of the soul.  This 
soul, he would say, is one substance, with faculties vegetative, 
sentient, and intelligent: it is the form of the body in respect of 
these vegetative and sentient faculties, and consequently in respect of 
the substance to which those faculties are attached, consequently also 
in respect even of the intelligent faculties, which are attached to the 
same substance of the soul.  For this distinction of faculty and 
substance see B&ouml;dder, <i>Psychologia</i>, pp. 314, 315.  The 
mediaeval mystics, as Thaulerus and Blosius, made much of this 
'substance of the soul' (<i>fundus animae</i>, they called it), as 
distinct from the faculties: in this <i>fundus animae</i>, they 
declared, God dwells by grace as in His sanctuary, even when he is not 
actually thought of.  It is the fashion now to rail at 'faculty 
psychology,' to scout the idea of 'substance,' to deny all 'potential 
being,' to allow of nothing but present actuality. Whoever is of that 
way of thinking, and takes up the Aristotelian idea of <b>nous 
ch&ocirc;ristos</b>, need not be surprised to find himself carried 
further from St Thomas than Averroes and Alexander, even to the setting 
aside of the individual man altogether.
