<i>Bona quaecunque aliquis vult in ordine ad bonum finem, 
bene vult</i>. The things must not only be 'in view
of a good end,' they must also be 'good,' that is, 
permissible, in themselves. See <i>Ethics and Natural Law</i>,
p. 32, n. 3. But has not St Thomas said that "on
the last end depends all the goodness or wickedness
of the will"? Yes, and therefore it is to be further
observed that "whoever has placed a good end before
him, and regards it steadily with a well-ordered love,
never swerving in his affection from the way that
reason would have him love, must needs take towards
his end those means, and those only, which are in
themselves reasonable and just: . . . . thus an end
entirely just, holy, and pure, purifies and sanctifies
the means, not by investing with a character of justice 
means in themselves unjust, but by way of elimination, 
removing unjust means as ineligible" (ib. pp. 36, 37).
