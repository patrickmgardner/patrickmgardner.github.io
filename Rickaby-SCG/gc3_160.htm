<H1>That it is reasonably reckoned a Man's own Fault if he be not 
converted to God, although he cannot be converted without Grace</h1>

SINCE no one can be set on the way to his last end without the aid of 
divine grace, or without it have the necessary means of reaching that 
end, as are faith, hope, love and perseverance, some might think that 
man is not to blame for being destitute of these gifts, especially 
seeing that he cannot merit the assistance of divine grace, nor be 
converted to God unless God convert him: for none is responsible for 
that which depends on another. But allow this, and many absurdities 
follow. It follows that the man who has neither faith nor hope nor love 
of God, nor perseverance in good, still does not deserve punishment: 
whereas it is expressly said: <i>He that believeth not the Son shall not 
see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him</i> (John iii, 36). And 
since none reaches the end of happiness without the aforesaid 
endowments, it would follow further that there are some who neither 
attain to happiness nor yet suffer punishment of God: the contrary 
whereof is shown from what will be said to all present at the judgement 
of God: <i>Come . . . . possess ye the kingdom prepared for you</i>, 
or, <i>Depart . . . . into everlasting fire</i> (Matt. xxv, 34-41).<p> 

To solve this doubt, we must observe that though one can neither merit 
divine grace beforehand, nor acquire it by movement of his free will, 
still he can hinder himself from receiving it: for it is said of some: 
<i>They have said unto God, 'Depart from us, we will not have the 
knowledge of thy ways'</i> (Job xxi, 14). And since it is in the power 
of free will to hinder the reception of divine grace or not to hinder 
it, not undeservedly may it be reckoned a man's own fault, if he puts 
an obstacle in the way of the reception of grace. For God on His part 
is ready to give grace to all men: <i>He wills all men to be saved and 
to come to the knowledge of the truth</i> (1 Tim. ii, 4). But they 
alone are deprived of grace, who in themselves raise an obstacle to 
grace. So when the sun lights up the world, any evil that comes to a 
man who shuts his eyes is counted his own fault, although he could not 
see unless the sunlight first came in upon him.<A
