<H1>That it was necessary for the Perfection of the Universe that 
there should be some Intellectual Natures</h1>

THIS then being the cause of the diversity among creatures, it remains  
now to treat of the several distinct creatures themselves as we 
proposed to do in the third part of this book (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_5.htm">V</a>). And we will show first that by the disposition 
of Divine Providence assigning perfection to creatures in the way best 
befitting them, it was consonant with reason that some intellectual 
creatures should be placed at the head of creation.<p>

5. Nothing else moves God to the production of creatures but His own 
goodness, which He has wished to communicate to other beings according 
to the manner of their assimilation to Himself (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_87.htm">LXXXVII</a>). Now the likeness of one thing may be 
found in another in two ways: in one way in point of natural being, as 
the likeness of heat is found in the body heated; in another way in 
point of knowledge, as the likeness of fire (perceived) is in sight or 
touch. In order then that the likeness of God might be in creatures in 
such modes as were possible, it was necessary that the divine goodness 
should be communicated to creatures, not only by likeness in being, but 
also by likeness in knowing. But mind alone can know the divine 
goodness. Therefore there needed to be intelligent creatures.<p>

6. In all comely arrangements of things, the attitude of the secondary 
to the last imitates the attitude of the first to all, as well 
secondary as last, though the imitation is not always perfect. Now God 
comprehends in Himself all creatures (B. I, Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc1_25.htm">XXV</a>, <A HREF="gc1_51.htm">LI</a>, <A 
HREF="gc1_54.htm">LIV</a>); and this is represented in material 
creatures, although in another way: for the higher body comprehends and 
contains the lower, according to quantitative extension;<A 
HREF="gc2_46a.htm">*</a> whereas God contains all creatures in simple 
mode, and not by quantitative extension. In order then that an 
imitation of God might not be wanting to creatures even in this mode of 
containing, there were made intellectual creatures to contain material 
creatures, not by any extension of quantity, but simply by mode of 
intelligence: for what is understood is in the mind that understands 
it, and is comprehended in its intellectual activity.
