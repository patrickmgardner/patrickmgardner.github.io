The text in the Epistle evidently points to that in the Gospel. The 
question is whether it outruns the Gospel in explicitness, as St Thomas 
argues, or keeps close within the textual lines of the former writing. 
The Vulgate, which St Thomas follows, differs from the Greek text in 
three particulars. (a) For <i>the true God</i>, the Greek is simply 
<b>ton al&ecirc;thinon</b> him who is true. (6) For <i>and be</i>, the 
Greek is <b>kai esmen</b>, <i>and we are</i>. (c) For <i>in his true 
Son</i>, the Greek is <b>en t&ocirc; al&ecirc;thin&ocirc;, en t&ocirc; 
hui&ocirc; autou</b>, <i>in him who is true, in his Son</i>. The 
literal rendering of the Greek, <i>et sumus in vero, infilio ejus</i>, 
would easily slip into the present Vulgate, <i>et sumus in vero, filio 
ejus</i>. Critically, the Greek is the true reading. It means, 'and we 
are united with Him who is true, by being united with His Son,' or, 
'through His Son.' But in the next clause, <i>Hic est verus Deus</i>, 
what is the antecedent of the pronoun <i>this</i>? The Fathers, in 
controversy with the Arians, refer the pronoun to <i>His Son Jesus 
Christ</i>. Others take the clause for a summing of and repetition of 
what has been said, much in the manner of St John. They refer the 
pronoun <b>houtos</b> therefore to <b>ton al&ecirc;thinon</b> and 
<b>t&ocirc; al&ecirc;thin&ocirc;</b>, <i>him who is true</i>. They 
point to the next clause, <i>Keep yourselves from idols</i>, and will 
have it that St John is not occupied here with the divinity of the Son, 
but with the divinity of the one true God in contradiction with idols, 
by worshipping which <i>the whole world</i> then <i>lay in the power of 
the evil one</i>. A Catholic's faith in the divinity of his Lord is not 
all staked on one pronoun. He can afford to be just, or even generous, 
to an Arian.
