<h1>Of the Conversion of Bread into the Body of Christ</h1>

IT is impossible for the true Body of Christ to begin to be in this 
Sacrament by local motion, because then it would cease to be in heaven, 
upon every consecration of this Sacrament; as also because this 
Sacrament could not then be consecrated except in one place, since one 
local motion can only have one terminus; also because local motion 
cannot be instantaneous, but takes time. Therefore its presence must be 
due to the conversion of the substance of bread into the substance of 
His Body, and of the substance of wine into the substance of His Blood. 
This shows the falseness of the opinion of those who say that the 
substance of bread co-exists with the substance of the Body of Christ 
in this Sacrament;<A HREF="gc4_63a.htm">*</a> also of those who say 
that the substance of bread is annihilated. If the substance of bread 
co-exists with the Body of Christ, Christ should rather have said, 
<i>Here is my Body</i>, than, <i>This is my Body</i>. The word 
<i>here</i> points to the substance which is seen, and that is the 
substance of bread, if the bread remain in the Sacrament along with the 
Body of Christ. On the other hand it does not seem possible for the 
substance of bread to be absolutely annihilated, for then much of the 
corporeal matter of the original creation would have been annihilated 
by this time by the frequent use of this mystery: nor is it becoming 
for anything to be annihilated in the Sacrament of salvation.<A 
HREF="gc4_63b.htm">*</a><p> 

We must observe that the conversion of bread into the Body of Christ 
falls under a different category from all natural conversions. In every 
natural conversion the subject remains, and in that subject different 
forms succeed one another: hence these are called 'formal conversions.' 
But in this conversion subject passes into subject, while the accidents 
remain: hence this conversion is termed 'substantial.' Now we have to 
consider how subject is changed into subject, a change which nature 
cannot effect. Every operation of nature presupposes matter, whereby 
subjects are individuated; hence nature cannot make this subject become 
that, as for instance, this finger that finger. But matter lies wholly 
under the power of God, since by that power it is brought into being: 
hence it may be brought about by divine power that one individual 
substance shall be converted into another pre-existing substance. By 
the power of a natural agent, the operation of which extends only to 
the producing of a change of form and presupposes the existence of the 
subject of change, <i>this</i> whole is converted into <i>that</i> 
whole with variation of species and form.<A HREF="gc4_63c.htm">*</a> So 
by the divine power, which does not presuppose matter, but produces it, 
<i>this</i> matter is converted into <i>that</i> matter, and 
consequently <i>this</i> individual into <i>that</i>: for matter is the 
principle of individuation, as form is the principle of species.<A 
HREF="gc4_63d.htm">*</a> Hence it is plain that in the change of the 
bread into <p> the Body of Christ there is no common subject abiding 
after the change, since the change takes place in the primary subject 
[i.e., in the matter], which is the principle of individuation. Yet 
something must remain to verify the words, <i>This is my body</i>, 
which are the words significant and effective of this conversion. But 
the substance does not remain: we must say therefore that what remains 
is something beside the substance, that is, the accident of bread. The 
accidents of bread then remain even after the conversion.<p> 

This then is one reason for the accident of bread remaining, that 
something may be found permanent under the conversion. Another reason 
is this. If the substance of bread was converted into the Body of 
Christ, and the accidents of bread also passed away, there would not 
ensue upon such conversion the being of the Body of Christ in substance 
where the bread was before: for nothing would be left to refer the Body 
of Christ to that place. But since the dimensions of bread (<i>quantitas 
dimensiva panis</i>), whereby the bread held this particular place, remain 
after conversion, while the substance of bread is changed into the Body 
of Christ, the Body of Christ comes to be under the dimensions of 
bread, and in a manner to occupy the place of the bread by means of the 
said dimensions.
