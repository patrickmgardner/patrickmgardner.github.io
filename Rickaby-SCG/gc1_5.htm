<H1>That it is an advantage for things that cannot he
searched out by Reason to be proposed as Tenets of Faith</h1>

SOME may possibly think that points which reason is unable to 
investigate ought not to be proposed to man to believe, since Divine 
Wisdom provides for every being according to the measure of its nature; 
and therefore we must show the necessity of things even that transcend 
reason being proposed by God to man for his belief.<P> 

1.     One proof is this. No one strives with any earnestness of desire 
after anything, unless it be known to him beforehand. Since, then, as 
will be traced out in the following pages (B.III, Chap.CXLVIII), Divine 
Providence directs men to a higher good than human frailty can 
experience in the present life, the mental faculties ought to be evoked 
and led onward to something higher than our reason can attain at 
present, learning thereby to desire something and earnestly to tend to 
something that transcends the entire state of the present life. And 
such is the special function of the Christian religion, which stands 
alone in its promise of spiritual and eternal goods, whereas the Old 
Law, carrying temporal promises, proposed few tenets that transcended 
the enquiry of human reason.<A HREF="gc1_5a.htm">*</a><P> 

2.     Also another advantage is thence derived, to wit, the repression 
of presumption, which is the mother of error. For there are some so 
presumptuous of their own genius as to think that they can measure with 
their understanding the whole nature of the Godhead, thinking all that 
to be true which seems true to them, and that to be false which does 
not seem true to them. In order then that the human mind might be 
delivered from this presumption, and attain to a modest style of 
enquiry after truth, it was necessary for certain things to be proposed 
to man from God that altogether exceeded his understanding.<P> 

     3.     There is also another evident advantage in this, that any 
knowledge, however imperfect, of the noblest objects confers a very 
high perfection on the soul. And therefore, though human reason cannot 
fully grasp truths above reason, nevertheless it is much perfected by 
holding such truths after some fashion at least by faith. And therefore 
it is said: <i>Many things beyond the understanding of man are shown to 
thee</i> (Ecclus iii, 23).  And, <i>The things that are of God, none 
knoweth but the Spirit of God: but to us God hath revealed them through 
his Spirit</i> (I Cor. ii, 10, 11).
