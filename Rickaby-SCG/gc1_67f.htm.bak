This distinction appears in modern logic books as <i>in sensu 
composito</i> and <i>in sensu diviso</i>.  It has its value in the 
disputes on efficacious grace. There is a tradition of Father Gregory 
de Valentia, S.J., fainting away when it was administered to him by a 
Dominican disputant. Bolsover Castle in Derbyshire was built by "the 
building countess," of whom it was said that she would never die, while 
she kept on building.  True <i>in sensu composito</i> only.  In point 
of fact the lady died in a great frost, which stopped her building and 
her breath together.
