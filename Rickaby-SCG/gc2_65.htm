<H1>That the Soul is not a Body</h1>

LIVING beings are composed of matter and form, -- of a body, and of a 
soul which makes them actually alive. One of these components must be 
the form, and the other the matter. But a body cannot be a form, 
because a body is not in another as in its matter and subject. 
Therefore the soul must be the form: therefore it is not a body.<A

5. The act of understanding cannot be the act of anything corporeal. 
But it is an act of the soul. Therefore the intellectual soul at least 
is not a body.<p> 

It is easy to solve the arguments whereby some have endeavoured to 
prove that the soul is a body. They point such facts as these, -- that 
the son resembles the father even in the accidents of his soul, being 
generated from the father by severance of bodily substance; and that 
the soul suffers with the body; and is separated from the body, 
separation supposing previous bodily contact. Against these instances we 
observe that bodily temperament is a sort of predisposing cause of 
affections of the soul: that the soul suffers with the body only 
accidentally, as being the form of the body: also that the soul is 
separated from the body, not as touching from touched, but as form 
from matter; although there is a certain contact possible between an 
incorporeal being and the body, as has been shown above (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_56.htm">LVI</a>).<p>

Many have been moved to this position by their belief that what is not 
a material body has no existence, being unable to transcend the 
imagination, which deals only with material bodies. Hence this opinion 
is proposed in the person of the unwise: <i>The breath of our nostrils 
is smoke, and reason a spark in the beating of the heart</i> (Wisdom 
ii, 2).<p>
