And yet it is commonly confessed that we do
not know the essences of things. Who knows the
essence even of a fly, or (till molecular mechanics go
further than they have done) of a lump of sugar?
We know essences, only in their highest generalities
and most abstract outlines. But we do know that, or
we should know nothing. We do not understand
anything unless we can say roughly what it is; and
that <i>what it is</i> is here called the <i>quidditas</i> or essence.
Lower animals take <i>quiddities</i> as they find them, e.g.,
a dog the quiddity of its master: they may be said to
know them <i>materially</i>, but they do not pass upon
them any explicit, <i>formal</i> judgement. Scientists and
philosophers make it their endeavour to go beyond
the <i>quidditv</i>, which is sufficient for the plain man to
know. They start from sense, but seek to transcend
sense. The 'pure quiddity' which the angel intues
is not the bare abstraction visible to the popular
mind: it is an intuition highly concrete, full of
'content,' discerning the essential from the accidental 
and the appropriate from the irrelevant, yet
not ignorant even of the latter: for things irrelevant
from one point of view are relevant from another.
Science and philosophy is an attempt to soar from a
human to an angelic view of things.
