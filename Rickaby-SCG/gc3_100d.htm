<i>Contra Faustum Manichaeum</i>, XXVI, Chap. iii.
St Augustine goes on to explain himself in apt
accordance with text and notes preceding: "We
call 'nature' the course of nature, that we know
and are accustomed to. When God does anything
contrary to this course, such doings are called 
extraordinary, or marvellous. But against that supreme law
of nature, which is hidden from the knowledge as
well of the wicked as of others who are still weak, God
is as far removed from ever doing anything as He is
removed from doing anything against Himself."<p>
