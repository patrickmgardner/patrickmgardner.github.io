There must be, for instance, a spiritual <i>fragrance</i> and an 
intellectual <i>velocity</i>. As the parables of the Gospel show -- 
and indeed the whole scheme of bible exegesis supposes it -- the things 
and the doings of this visible material world are types of invisible 
realities. Nature is constructed on hierarchical lines. Our mortal 
minds ascend feebly where the angels descend in their strength, by a 
sort of Jacob's ladder, we by type from earth to heaven, they by 
antitype from heaven to earth.
