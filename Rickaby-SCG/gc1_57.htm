<H1>That the Knowledge of God is not a Reasoned Knowledge</h1>

OUR thought is then reasoned, when we pass from one object of thought 
to another, as in making syllogisms from principles to conclusions. 
Reasoning or arguing does not consist in seeing how a conclusion 
follows from premises by inspection of both together.  That is not 
argument, but judging of argument.<A HREF="gc1_57a.htm">*</a> Now God 
does not think of one thing after another in any sort of succession, 
but of all things at once (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_55.htm">LV</a>). His 
knowledge therefore is not reasoned or argumentative, although He knows 
the argument and reason of all things.<P> 

2. Every reasoner intues principles with one thought, and the 
conclusion with another. There would be no need to proceed to a 
conclusion from the consideration of premises, if the mere 
consideration of the premises at once laid the conclusion bare. But God 
knows all things by one act which is His essence (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_55.htm">LV</a>). His knowledge therefore is not 
argumentative.<P>

3. All argumentative knowledge has something of actuality and something 
of potentiality, for conclusions are potentially in premises.  But in 
the divine mind potentiality has no place.<P>

5. Things that are known naturally are known without reasoning, as 
appears in the case of first principles. But in God there can be no 
knowledge that is not natural, nay, essential: for His knowledge is His 
essence.<P>

7. Only in its highest advance does the inferior touch upon the 
superior. But the highest advance of our knowledge is not reasoning, 
but intuition (<i>intellectus</i>), which is the starting-point of 
reasoning.  God's knowledge then is not 'rational,' in the sense of 
'argumentative,' but intuitive only.<A HREF="gc1_57b.htm">*</a><P>

8. Reasoning means a lack of intuition: the divine knowledge therefore
is not reasoned.<P>

If any should take it amiss that God cannot make a syllogism, let them
mark that He has the knowledge how to make syllogisms as one judging of
them, not as one arguing syllogistically.<P>

To this there is witness of Holy Scripture in the text: <i>All things 
are naked and open to his eyes</i> (Heb. iv, i 3): whereas things that 
we know by reasoning are not of themselves naked and open to us, but 
are opened out and laid bare by reason.
