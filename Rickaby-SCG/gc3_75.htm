<H1>That the Providence of God is exercised over Individual and 
Contingent Things</h1>

IF God has no care of these individual things, that is either because 
He does not know them, or because He has no power over them, or because 
He has no will to take care of them. But it has been shown above (B. I, 
Chap. <A HREF="gc1_65.htm">LXV</a>) that God has knowledge of 
individual things. Nor can it be said that He has no power to take care 
of them, seeing that His power is infinite (B. II, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_22.htm">XXII</a>). Nor again that God has no wilt to govern 
them, seeing that the object of His will is universally all good (B. I, 
Chap. <A HREF="gc1_78.htm">LXXVIII</a>).<p> 

3. This common attribute is found in productive causes, that they have 
a care of the things that they produce, as animals naturally nourish 
their young. God thereof has care of the things of which He is the 
cause. But He is the cause even of these particular things (B. II, 
Chap. <A HREF="gc2_15.htm">XV</a>), and therefore He has care of 
them.<A HREF="gc3_75a.htm">*</a><p> 

5. It would be a foolish providence not to take care of those things 
without which the objects of one's care could not exist. But certainly, 
if all particulars were to fail, universals could not remain. If then 
God has care of the universal only, and neglects the individual 
altogether, His providence must be foolish and imperfect. But if it is 
said that God has care of individuals so far as to see that they are 
maintained in being, but no further, that answer cannot stand. For all 
that befalls individuals has some bearing on their preservation or 
destruction. If therefore God has care of individuals so far as to see 
to their preservation, He must have care of all that befalls them.<p> 

7. This is the difference between speculative and practical knowledge, 
that speculative knowledge and all that concerns such knowledge is 
wrought out in generalities, whereas the sphere of practical knowledge 
is the particular. For the end of practical knowledge is truth, which 
consists primarily and ordinarily in the immaterial and universal, 
while the end of practical knowledge is action, which deals with 
particular facts. Hence the physician does not attend man in general, 
but this man; and to the care of the individual man the whole science 
of medicine is directed. But providence, being directive of things to 
their end, must be a department of practical knowledge. Thus the 
providence of God would be very imperfect, if it stopped short at the 
universal, and did not reach individual cases.<p> 

8. The perfection of speculative knowledge lies in the universal rather 
than in the particular: universals are better known than particulars; 
and therefore the knowledge of the most general principles is common to 
all. Still, even in speculative science, he is more perfect who has not 
a mere general but a concrete (<i>propriam</i>) knowledge of things. 
For he who knows in the general only, knows a thing only potentially. 
Thus the scholar is reduced from a general knowledge of principles to a 
concrete knowledge of conclusions by his master, who has both 
knowledges, -- as a being is reduced from potentiality to actuality by 
another being, already in actuality. Much more in practical science is 
he more perfect, who disposes things for actuality not merely in the 
universal but in the particular. God's most perfect providence 
therefore extends even to individuals.<p> 

9. Since God is the cause of being, as such (B. II, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_15.htm">XV</a>), He must also be the provider of being, as 
such. Whatever then in any way is, falls under His providence. But 
singular things are beings, and indeed more so than universals, because 
universals do not subsist by themselves, but are only in singulars.<A 
HREF="gc3_75b.htm">*</a> Divine providence therefore has care also of 
singulars.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Two sparrows are sold for a farthing; and not one 
of them falls to the ground without your Father</i> (Matt. x, 29); and, 
<i>[Wisdom] reaches from end to end strongly</i> (Wisd. viii, 1), that 
is, from the highest creatures to the lowest. Also their opinion is 
condemned who said: <i>The Lord hath abandoned the earth, the Lord doth 
not see</i> (Ezech. ix, 9): <i>He walketh about the poles of heaven, 
and doth not consider our things</i> (Job xxii, 14).
