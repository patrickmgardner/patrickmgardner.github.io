<H1>In what sense one is said to be Fortunate, and how Man is aided by 
Higher Causes<A HREF="gc3_92a.htm">*</a></h1>

GOOD fortune is said to befall a man, when something good happens to 
him beyond his intention, as when one digging a field finds a treasure 
that he was not looking for.  Now an agent may do something beyond his 
own intention, and yet not beyond the intention of some agent whom he 
is under: as if a master were to bid a servant to go to some place, to 
which he had sent another servant without the first servant knowing of 
it, the meeting with his fellow-servant would be beyond the intention 
of the servant sent, and yet not beyond the intention of the master 
sending: in reference to the servant it will be luck and chance, but 
not in reference to the master, -- to him it is an arrangement.  Since 
then man is subordinate in body to the forces of physical nature 
(<i>corporibus coelestibus</i>), subordinate in intellect to the 
angels, and subordinate in will to God, a thing may happen beside the 
intention of man, which is nevertheless according to the order of  
physical nature (<i>corporum coelestium</i>), or according to the 
arrangement of angels, or again of God.  But though God alone works 
directly upon man's choice, yet the action of an angel does something 
for that choice by way of persuasion, while the action of the heavenly 
body (of the forces of physical nature) does something by way of 
predisposition, inasmuch as the bodily impressions of the heavenly 
bodies (physical forces) upon our bodies predispose us to certain 
choices.<A HREF="gc3_92b.htm">*</a>  When then under the impression of 
the physical forces of nature (<i>coelestium corporum</i>) one is 
swayed to certain choices that prove useful to him, though his own 
reason does not discern their utility; and simultaneously under the 
light shed on him by separately subsistent intelligences, his 
understanding is enlightened to do those acts, and his will is swayed 
by a divine act to choose that useful course, the utility whereof goes 
unperceived by him, -- then he is said to be a 'fortunate man.'<A 
HREF="gc3_92c.htm">*</a><p>

But here a difference is to be noted.  For the action of the angel and 
of the physical force (<i>corporis coelestis</i>) merely predisposes 
the man to choose, but the action of God accomplishes the choice.  And 
since the predisposition that comes of the bodily affection, or of the 
persuasion of the understanding, does not induce necessity of choice, 
man does not always choose that which his guardian angel intends, nor 
that to which physical nature (<i>corpus coeleste</i>) inclines, but 
man always chooses that which God works in his will.<A 
HREF="gc3_92d.htm">*</a>  Hence the guardianship of the angels 
sometimes comes to nought, according to the text: <i>We have tended 
Babylon, but she is not healed</i> (Jerem. li, 9). And much more may 
physical inclination (<i>inclinatio coelestium corporum</i>) come to 
nought: but divine providence always holds firm.<p>

It is further to be observed that good or ill fortune may befall a man 
as a matter of luck, so far as his intention goes, and so far as the 
working of the prime forces of nature (<i>corpora coelestia</i>) goes, 
and so far as the mind of the angels goes, but not in regard of God: 
for in reference to God nothing is by chance, nothing unforeseen, either 
in human life or anywhere else in creation.
