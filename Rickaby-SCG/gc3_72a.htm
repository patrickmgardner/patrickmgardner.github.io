The <i>contingent</i>, <b>sumbeb&ecirc;kos</b>, is that which is, but
might not be (Aristotle, <i>Physics</i>, VIII, v). The term
is still of interest to the logician, and to the psychologist, 
who concerns himself with the freedom of the
will, but has lost all interest in physical science, 
except in the cognate sense of <i>accidental</i>.
