A curious foreshadowing of Averroes: see B. II, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_60.htm">LX</a>. Apollinaris, a friend of St Athanasius and of 
the Sophist Libanius, sat in a synod in 362 as bishop of Laodicea. He 
was a better classical scholar than theologian; and was the first to 
attempt to rewrite the classics in the service of Christianity. His 
doctrine was condemned in the second General Council, that of 
Constantinople, in 380. Arius, making the Word but a creature, had 
less difficulty in supposing the Logos to do the office of a soul. 
Apollinaris was anti-Arian, and so came to admit some manner of human 
soul in Christ.
