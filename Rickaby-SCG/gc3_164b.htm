There are two steps in predestination: (1) God's
determination to give grace; (2) God's determination
to give glory according to the measure of grace given
and taken. The first determination is entirely gratuitous, 
and independent of all regard to merit in the
recipient. This all Catholics confess. The second
determination has been matter of great controversy
among Catholic theologians, whether it is in view of
or irrespective of foreseen merits in the predestinate.
