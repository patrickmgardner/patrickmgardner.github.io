In the scholastic theory, <i>materia prima,</i> or 
primordial matter, is never found, as the chemistry
books speak, 'free,' but always in composition with
some form or another: it cannot be 'isolated.'  Still no
one form can be mentioned with which it must be
compounded, if it is to be at all.  If I must eat fruit,
I need not eat peaches.
