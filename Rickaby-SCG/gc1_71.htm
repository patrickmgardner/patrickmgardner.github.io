<H1>That God knows Evil Things</h1>
 
WHEN good is known, the opposite evil is known.  But God knows
all particular good things, to which evil things are opposed:
therefore God knows evil things.<P>

2. The ideas of contraries, as ideas in the mind, are not contrary to 
one another: otherwise they could not be together in the mind, or be 
known together: the idea therefore whereby evil is known is not 
inconsistent with good, but rather belongs to the idea of good 
(<i>ratio qua cognoscitur malum ad rationem boni pertinet</i>).<A 
HREF="gc1_71a.htm">*</a> If then in God, on account of His absolute 
perfection, there are found all ideas of goodness (<i>rationes 
bonitatis</i>, as has been proved (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_40.htm">XL</a>), 
It follows that there is in Him the idea (<i>ratio</i>) whereby evil is 
known.<P> 

3. Truth is the good of the understanding: for an understanding is 
called good inasmuch as it knows the truth.  But truth is not only to 
the effect that good is good, but also that evil is evil: for as it is 
true that what is, is, so it is true that what is not, is not. The good 
of the understanding therefore consists even in the knowledge of evil.  
But since the divine understanding is perfect in goodness, there cannot 
be wanting to it any of the perfections of understanding; and therefore 
there is present to it the knowledge of things evil.<P> 

4. God knows the distinction of things (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_50.htm">L</a>).  But in the notion of distinction there is 
negation: for those things are distinct, of which one is not another: 
hence the first things that are of themselves distinct, mutually 
involve the exclusion of one another, by reason of which fast negative 
propositions are immediately verified of them, e.g., 'No quantity is a 
substance.' God then knows negation. But privation is a sort of 
negation: He therefore knows privation, and consequently evil, which is 
nothing else than a privation of due perfection.<P> 

8. In us the knowledge of evil things is never blameworthy in mere 
point of knowledge, that is in the judgement that is passed about evil 
things, but accidentally, inasmuch as by the observation of evil things 
one is sometimes inclined to evil. But that cannot be in God; and 
therefore there is nothing to prevent His knowing evil.<P> 

With this agrees what is said, that <i>Evil surpasseth not</i> [God's] 
<i>wisdom</i> (Wisd. vii 30) and, <i>Hell and perdition are before the 
Lord</i> (Prov. xv, 11) and, <i>My offences are not hidden from 
thee</i> (Ps. lxviii, 6); and, <i>He knoweth the vanity of men, and 
seeing doth he not consider iniquity?</i> (Job xi, 11.)<P>

It is to be observed however that if God's knowledge were so limited as 
that His knowledge of Himself did not involve His knowing other beings 
of finite and partial goodness, at that rate He would nowise know 
privation or evil: because to the good which is God Himself there is no 
privation opposed, since privation and its opposite are naturally about 
the same object; and so to that which is pure actuality no privation is 
opposed, and consequently no evil either.  Hence on the supposition 
that God knows Himself alone, by knowing the excellences of His own 
being, He will not know evil.<A HREF="gc1_71b.htm">*</a> But because in 
knowing Himself He knows beings in which privations naturally occur, He 
must know the opposite privations, and the evils opposite to 
particular goods.<P>

It must be further observed that as God, without any argumentative 
process, knows other beings by knowing Himself, so there is no need of 
His knowledge being argumentative in coming to the knowledge of evil 
things through good things: for good is as it were the ground of the 
knowledge of evil, evil being nothing else than privation of good: 
hence what is evil is known through what is good as things are known 
through their definitions, not as conclusions through their 
premises.
