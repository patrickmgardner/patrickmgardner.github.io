I add by way of note the sequel in the text. The
refinements of scholasticism have their place in the
history of human thought.<p>

"Corporeity may be taken in two senses. In one
way as it is the substantial form of a body, according
as that body has its place in the genus of substance.
Taken thus, the corporeity of any body is nothing
else than its substantial form, in respect of which the
body is classified according to genus and species: by
virtue of this substantial form it is due to a bodily
thing to exist in three dimensions. For there are not
different substantial forms in one and the same thing;
one form, to place it in the highest genus, say, of
'substance'; and another to place it in the proximate
genus, say, of 'corporeal' or 'animal substance'; and
a third to put it in the species, say, of 'man' or
'horse': for if the first form made it a substance, the
forms that followed would supervene upon something
that was already in actuality and subsisting in nature;
and thus the latter forms would not make it an individual 
thing, but would be in a subject that was already
an individual thing, as is the case with accidental forms.
Corporeity, therefore, considered as the substantial
form in man, can be no other than the rational soul,
which requires in its matter the possession of three
dimensions: for it is the actualising principle of a body.
In another way corporeity is taken to mean the accidental 
form whereby a body is said to be in the genus
of quantity; and taken thus, corporeity is nothing else
than the three dimensions which make the essence of
a body. Though then this corporeity falls away to
nothing when the human body rots, that cannot
hinder the body from rising again numerically the
same, since corporeity in the first sense does not fall
away to nothing, but remains the same."
