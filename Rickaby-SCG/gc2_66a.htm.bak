A fifth argument is alleged from Aristotle, <i>De anima</i>, III, iv, 
6, which comes to this: -- A sensory organ is damaged by meeting with 
its object in a high degree: vivid light is seen, and crashing sounds 
are heard, but to the damage of eye and ear; whereas a highly 
intellectual object, -- Aristotelian psychology, for example, -- if 
understood at all, is understood to the improvement of the  
understanding; the understanding, as  such, not  working   through   
any bodily organ.<p>

St Thomas however is far from confining dumb animals to mere sensation. 
He allows them sense memory, phantasy, a sort of judgement called 
<i>vis aestimativa</i> (notes pp. <A HREF="gc2_59a.htm">122</a>, <A 
HREF="gc2_60a.htm">125</a>), and a certain power of self-determination   
(Chap. <A HREF="gc2_48.htm">XLVIII</a>, <A HREF="gc2_48b.htm">n. 
2</a>).   He  denies in the intellect, free will, the powers of forming 
general concepts and determining their own judgements, and the 
immortality of their souls.
