This would emphasise the pronoun, <i>to give</i> TO
YOU. Unfortunately that pronoun is absent in the
Greek, which may be rendered: <i>It is not mine to give:
it is only for them for whom it is prepared</i>. We may 
perhaps accommodate St Thomas thus: 'It is not in my
power to give on the title on which it is asked,' --
namely the title of personal friendship and family
connexion.
