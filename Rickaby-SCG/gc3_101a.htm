'Wondering' here is scarcely the right word:
rather 'being surprised,' or 'puzzled.' The mind must
view with awe &amp; wonder all great fulfilments whether
of the anticipations of science or of the promises of
faith. One cannot fancy Newton viewing an eclipse
without wonder. A look of wonder is sometimes the
last look that comes over the face of the dying.
