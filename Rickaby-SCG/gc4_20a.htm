<i>Moved</i>, or as another version has it, <i>brooded</i>, which is 
better in keeping with the character of the Holy Ghost as the 'giver of 
life.' I need only mention the other translation of <i>Spiritus Dei</i> 
as a <i>mighty wind</i> is a translation as old as St Ephrem and 
Theodoret; and one which St Thomas was not unwilling to take account 
of; as he presently says (Chap. XXIII): "Although some wish to 
understand this, not of the Holy Ghost, but of the air, which has its 
natural place near the water: hence, to signify its manifold 
transformations, it is said that it <i>was borne over the waters</i>." 
Nor can I deal with the vexed question as to what notion the human 
authors of the Old Testament had of the triple personality of God.
