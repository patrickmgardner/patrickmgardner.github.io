<H1>That the Punishment whereby one is deprived of his Last End is 
Interminable<A HREF="gc3_145a.htm">*</a></h1>

THERE is no privation except of that which naturally belongs to the 
subject: a puppy at birth cannot be said to lie under any privation of 
sight. But man is not apt to attain his last end in this life (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_48.htm">XLVIII</a>). Therefore any privation of such end must 
come as a punishment after this life. But after this life there remains 
to man no ability of gaining his last end, since it is through the body 
that he gains perfection alike in knowledge and in virtue.<A 
HREF="gc3_145b.htm">*</a> And once the soul is separated from the body, 
it returns not again to this state of receiving perfection from the 
body, as we have argued above (B. II, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_83.htm">LXXXIII</a>) against the advocates of the 
transmigration of souls (<i>transcorporationem ponentes</i>). Whoever 
then incurs this punishment must be deprived of his last end, and 
remain eternally deprived of it.<p> 

3. Natural equity seems to require every one to be deprived of the good 
against which he takes action, as thereby he renders himself unworthy 
of that good. Hence by process of civil justice whoever offends against 
the commonwealth is deprived of the society of the commonwealth 
altogether, either by death or by perpetual banishment. Nor is the time 
taken by his offence considered, but the power against which he has 
offended. He then who sins against his last end and against charity, 
which is the foundation of the society of the Blessed and of wayfarers 
on the road to Blessedness, ought to be punished eternally, though his 
sin took only a short space of time.<p> 

4. In the divine judgement the will is taken for the deed: because as 
men see what is done outwardly, so does God view the hearts of men. 
But whoever for the sake of some temporal good has turned himself away 
from the final end, which is possessed for ever, has preferred the 
temporal enjoyment of that good to the eternal enjoyment of the last 
end: much more then, it clearly appears, would he have willed the 
enjoyment of that temporal good for all eternity. Therefore according 
to the divine judgement he ought to be punished as though he had gone 
on sinning for eternity. And beyond question, for eternal sin eternal 
punishment is due.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>These shall go into everlasting punishment, but 
the just into life everlasting</i> (Matt. xxv, 46).<p>

Hereby is excluded the error of them who say that the punishment of the 
wicked will at some time come to an end. This position seems to have 
had its foundation in the position of certain philosophers<A 
HREF="gc3_145c.htm">*</a> who said that all punishments were 
purgatorial, and consequently at some time terminable. And this 
position seems plausible, as well by the custom of mankind, for human 
laws inflict penalties as means and in a manner medicines for the 
amendment of vices; as also by reason, for if punishment were 
inflicted, not for the sake of something else, but for its own sake, it 
would follow that the authority punishing took delight in punishments 
for their own sake, which is inconsistent with the goodness of God: it 
needs must be then that punishment is inflicted for the sake of 
something else, and no more suitable end appears than the amendment of 
vices. There seems therefore reason for saying that all punishments are 
purgatorial, and consequently terminable, since whatever is matter of 
purgation is accidental in regard of the creature, and can be removed 
without consumption of its substance.<p> 

In reply it must be allowed that punishments are inflicted by God, not 
for their own sake, as though God took delight in them, but for the 
sake of something else, namely, in view of the order which He wishes to 
impose on creatures, in which order the good of the universe consists 
(B. II, Chap. <A HREF="gc2_45.htm">XLV</a>). The order of the universe 
requires all things to be dispensed by God in due proportion, in 
<i>weight, number, and measure</i> (Wisd. xi, 21). But as rewards answer 
proportionably to virtuous actions, so punishments to sins; and to some 
sins everlasting punishments are proportionable. God then inflicts 
eternal punishments on some sins, that the due order may be observed in 
things, which order proves His wisdom.<p> 

But even though one were to allow that all punishments are applied to 
the amendment of vices, and to no other purpose, not on that account 
are we obliged to suppose that all punishments are purgatorial and 
terminable. For even by human laws some men are punished by death, not 
for their amendment, but for the amendment of others: hence it is said: 
<i>For the scourging of the pestilent man, the fool shall be wiser</i> 
(Prov. xix, 25).<A HREF="gc3_145d.htm">*</a> Sometimes also human laws 
drive men out of the State into perpetual banishment, that the State 
may be purer by being rid of them: hence it is said: <i>Cast out the 
scorner, and the quarrel will go out with him, and suits and brow-
beatings will cease</i> (Prov. xxii, 10). Even then though punishments 
be employed only for the reformation of manners, it may very well be 
that by the judgement of God some men ought to be for ever separated 
from the society of the good and eternally punished, that by the fear 
of everlasting punishment men may cease to sin, and the society of the 
good may be the purer for their separation, as it is said: <i>There 
shall not enter therein anything unclean, or making abomination or 
lying</i> (Apoc. xxi, 27).<A HREF="gc3_145e.htm">*</a>
