Thus uneducated people, bound up in their domestic surroundings, often 
show inability to understand, because they cannot conceive of qualities 
apart from the familiar objects in which they see them: e.g., 'weight' 
to them means their heaviest piece of furniture, 'learning' is their 
parson, etc. This is amusingly illustrated in Plato's <i>Hippias 
Major</i>.
