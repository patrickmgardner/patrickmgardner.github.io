<H1>Of the Incarnation of the Word according to the Tradition of Holy 
Scripture</h1>

OF all the works of God, the mystery of the Incarnation most transcends 
reason. Nothing more astonishing could be imagined as done by God than 
that the true God and Son of God should become true man. To this chief 
of wonders all other wonders are subordinate. We confess this wonderful 
Incarnation under the teaching of divine authority, John i, 14: Phil. 
ii, 6-11. The words of our Lord Jesus Christ Himself also declare it, 
in that sometimes He says of Himself humble and human things, e.g., 
<i>The Father is greater than I</i> (John xiv, 28): <i>My soul is 
sorrowful even unto death</i> (Matt. xxvi, 38): which belonged to Him 
in the humanity which He had assumed: at other times lofty and divine 
things, e.g., <i>I and the Father are one</i> (John x, 30): <i>All 
things that the Father hath are mine</i> (John xvi, 15): which attach 
to Him in His divine nature. And the actions that are recorded of Him 
show the same duality of nature. His being stricken with fear, 
sadness, hunger, death, belongs to His human nature: His healing the 
sick by His own power, His raising the dead and effectually commanding 
the elements, His casting out of devils, forgiving of sins, His rising 
from the dead when He willed, and finally ascending into heaven, show 
the power of God that was in Him.
