In other words, man lives under a supernatural
providence; or, as St Augustine was fond of repeating
to his people at Hippo: "Not for this world are you
a Christian." Not that the interests of this world are
to be disregarded, but they are to be kept subordinate. 
A momentous utterance, indicative of the whole
policy of the Christian Church, and of the Church's
abiding quarrel with secularism, utilitarianism, greed
of markets, and other aberrations from the eternal
goal, and even from the true notion of happiness on
earth, as that consists in content of mind and heart
and social charity; in lieu of which we have taken in
exchange our ever growing armaments, our thousands
of unemployed, the degradation of our poor, our inanities 
and frivolities, our mental unrest and unsatisfied
soul-hunger.
