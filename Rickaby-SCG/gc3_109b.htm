Every voluntary agent loves himself. God, having
none higher than Himself, is not called upon to
subordinate His love of Himself to any other love.
But angels, or man, while naturally, necessarily, and
rightly loving himself, is further called upon to 
subordinate his love of himself to the love of God. This
further call he may fail to comply with: then he sins.<p>

The argument in the text is directed against the
Platonists, who ascribed all sinful tendency to the
body, and consequently could see no possibility of
sin in a pure spirit, or angel, and thus came to reject
the Christian dogma of the fall of the angels.
