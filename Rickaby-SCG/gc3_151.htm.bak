<H1>That the aforesaid Assistance is called 'Grace,' and what is the 
meaning of 'Grace constituting a State of Grace'<A HREF="gc3_151a.htm>*</a></h1>

BECAUSE what is given to another without any previous deserts of his is 
said to be given gratis, and because the divine aid given to man 
anticipates all human deserving, it follows that this aid is given to 
man gratis, and therefore is aptly called by the name of 'grace.' Hence 
the Apostle says: <i>If by grace, it is not now of works, otherwise 
grace is no more grace</i> (Rom. xi, 6).<p> 

There is also another reason why the aforesaid assistance of God has 
received the name of 'grace.' One person is said to be 'in the good 
graces' of another, because he is well loved by him. Now it is of the 
essence of love that he who loves should wish good and do good to him 
whom he loves. God indeed wishes and does good to all His creatures, 
for the very being of the creature and its every perfection is of God 
willing and working it (B. I, Chapp. <A HREF="gc1_29.htm">XXIX</a>, <A 
HREF="gc1_30.htm">XXX</a>: B. II, Chap. <A HREF="gc2_15.htm">XV</a>): 
hence it is said: <i>Thou lovest all things that are, and hatest none 
of the things that thou hast made</i> (Wisd. xi, 25). But a special tie 
of divine love is observable in connexion with those to whom He renders 
assistance, enabling them to attain the good which transcends the order 
of their nature, namely, the perfect fruition, not of any created good, 
but of God's own self. This assistance then is aptly called 'grace,' 
not only because it is given 'gratis,' but also because by this 
assistance a man comes to be, by a special prerogative, 'in the good 
graces' of God.<p> 

This grace, in the man in the state of grace, must be a form and 
perfection of him who has it.<p> 

1. That whereby a man is directed to an end must be in continual 
relation with him: for the mover works change continually until the 
body moved attains the term of its motion.<A HREF="gc3_151b.htm>*</a> 
Since then man is directed to his last end by the assistance of divine 
grace, he must continually enjoy this assistance until he arrives at 
the end. But that would not be if the assistance were afforded him only 
as a sort of motion or passion, and not as a form abiding and, as it 
were, resting in him: for the movement and passion would not be in the 
man, except when his attention was being actually turned to the end, as 
is not the case continually, which is evident most of all in men 
asleep. Therefore the grace that puts a man in the state of grace is a 
form and perfection abiding in man, even when he is not actively 
engaged.<p> 

2. The love of God is causative of the good that is in us, as the love 
of man is called forth and caused by some good that is in the object of 
his love. But man is excited to special love by some special good 
pre-existent in the object. Therefore where there is posited a special 
love of God for man, there must consequently be posited some special 
good conferred by God on man. Since then the grace that constitutes the 
State of grace denotes a special love of God for man, there must be 
likewise denoted some special goodness and perfection thereby existing 
in man.<p>

3. Everything is ordained to an end suited to it according to the 
character of its form: for of different species there are different 
ends. But the end to which man is directed by the assistance of divine 
grace is something above human nature. Therefore there must be 
superadded to man some supernatural form and perfection, whereby he may 
be aptly ordained to the aforesaid end.<p> 

4. Man ought to arrive at his last end by dint of activities of his 
own. Now everything is active in virtue of some form of its own. In 
order then that man may be brought to his last end by activities of his 
own, there must be superadded to him some form, to validate his 
activities for the gaining of his last end.<p> 

5. Divine providence provides for all according to the mode of their 
nature. But it is a mode proper to man to require for the perfection of 
his actions, over and above his natural powers, certain perfections in 
the shape of habits, whereby he may do good, and do it well, 
connaturally, readily, and pleasantly.<A HREF="gc3_151c.htm>*</a> 
Therefore the aid of grace, given man by God for arriving at his last 
end, implies some form and perfection intrinsic to man.<p> 

Hence in Scripture the grace of God is spoken of as light: <i>Ye were 
once darkness, but now light in the Lord</i> (Eph. v, 8). The 
perfection whereby man is led on to his final end in the vision of God 
is appropriately termed light, light being the principle of vision.<p> 

Hereby is set aside the opinion of some who say that the grace of God 
is no positive quality in man (<i>nihil in homine ponit</i>), as no 
positive quality is ascribed to the courtier who is said to be in the 
good graces of the King, but rather to the King who has an affection 
for him. We see how this mistake arose, from failing to observe the 
difference between divine love and human love: for divine love is 
causative of the good that it loves in another, but not so human 
love.<A HREF="gc3_151d.htm>*</a>
