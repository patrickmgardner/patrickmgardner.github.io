Recent speculations on the 'subconscious' have shown that conscious and 
unconscious action do not stand so widely apart as a superficial 
observation would conclude.  St Thomas here, and often elsewhere, with 
Aristotle (see <i>Physics</i>, II, v, 2), bridges over the difference 
between them, arguing the operations of conscious and of unconscious 
nature to be both teleological.  But is there an agent whose intention 
or contrivance extends throughout all nature?  That is the argument of 
B. I, Chap. XIII, where 'prime mover' means at once 'prime executor' 
and 'prime contriver.'
