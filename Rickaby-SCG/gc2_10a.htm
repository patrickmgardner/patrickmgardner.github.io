Writing in <i>Mind</i> for November, 1902, Mr Bradley refuses to allow 
the term 'will' in  man to bear any other meaning than that of actual 
'volition.'  He merges 'power,' or 'faculty,' in 'act,' an 
identification which, St Thomas says, holds only in God.  This is in 
keeping with Mr Bradley's steady and uncompromising repudiation of all 
potential being.  Potential being, if it be at all, is the undoing of 
his philosophy.  But see <i>Appearance and Reality,</i> pp. 384-7.
