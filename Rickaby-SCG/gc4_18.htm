<H1>That the Holy Ghost is a Subsistent Person</h1>

BUT inasmuch as some have maintained that the Holy Ghost is not a 
subsistent Person, but is either the divinity of the Father and the Son 
(cf. St Aug. <i>de haeresibus</i>, n. 52), or some accidental 
perfection of the mind given us by God, as wisdom, or charity, or 
other such created accidents, we must evince the contrary.<p> 

1. Accidental forms do not properly work, but the subject that has them
works according to the arbitrement of his own will: thus a wise man uses
wisdom when he wills. But the Holy Ghost works according to the 
arbitrement of His own will (1 Cor. xii, 11).<p>

2. The Holy Ghost is not to be accounted an accidental perfection of 
the human mind, seeing that He is the cause of such perfections: for 
<i>the charity of God is spread abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost 
who is given to us</i> (Rom. v, 5): <i>To one is given by the Spirit 
the utterance of wisdom, to another the utterance of knowledge 
according to the same Spirit</i> (1 Cor. xii, 8).<p> 

3. The Holy Ghost <i>proceeds from the Father</i> and <i>receives</i> 
from the Son (John xv, 26: xvi, 14): which cannot be understood of the 
divine essence.<p> 

4. Scripture speaks of the Holy Ghost as of a subsistent Person: <i>The 
Holy Ghost said to them: Set aside for me Barnabas and Saul for the 
work unto which I have taken them: . . . . and they, sent by the Holy 
Ghost, went</i> (Acts xiii, 2, 4,): <i>It hath seemed good to the Holy 
Ghost and us</i> (Acts xv, 28).<p> 

5. The Father and the Son being subsistent Persons and of divine 
nature, the Holy Ghost would not be numbered with them (Matt. 
xxviii, 19: 2 Cor. xiii, 13: 1 John v, 7) were He not a Person 
subsistent in the divine nature.
