<i>Nic. Eth.</i> I, x, 16: "We will call them happy in life who have and 
shall have the specified qualifications, -- I mean, they are happy men." 
In X, vii, 8, he bids us aim at a happiness "too good for man"; and 
concludes (X, viii, 8): "For heavenly beings, all their life is happy: 
for men, life is happy so far as they have any likeness of this 
blissful activity of contemplation: of other animals, none is happy, 
since they have no part in contemplation.
