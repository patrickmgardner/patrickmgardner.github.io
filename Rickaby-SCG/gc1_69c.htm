Unity is 'the principle of number,' but is not
itself number.  The first number, as the Greeks saw,
is two. Infinity is no number either. It is not the
crowning number of a series of finite quantities, for
it can never be got at by counting. As compared with
an infinity of a higher order, the infinity of a lower
order again is no number: it is (relatively) zero.
Neither in lateral extension, then, nor in vertical
superimposition, is infinity a number. The numbers
are two, three, four, and so on as far as you can count.
Each of these terms is called by the schoolmen 'a species
of number.'
