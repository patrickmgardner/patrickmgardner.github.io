<b>ho de kurios to pneuma estin</b>, means <i>now the Lord
is the Spirit</i>: that is to say, the Lord, mentioned in the
previous verse, 16, -- even the Yahweh of Exodus
xxxiv, 34, to which that verse refers, -- <i>is the Holy
Ghost</i>. This is a statement of the divinity of the Holy 
Ghost in so many words, as the Greek Fathers 
elaborately argue, and as St Thomas would not have
failed to argue, had he been more familiar with
Greek.<p>
