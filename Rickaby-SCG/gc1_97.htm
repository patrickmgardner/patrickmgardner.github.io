<H1>That God is Living</h1>

IT has been shown that God is intelligent and willing: but to 
understand and will are functions of a living being only.<p> 

2. Life is attributed to beings inasmuch as they appear to move of 
themselves, and not to be moved by another.  Therefore things that seem 
to move of themselves, the moving powers of which the vulgar do not 
perceive, are figuratively said to live, as we speak of the 'living' 
(running) water of a flowing stream, but not so of a cistern or 
stagnant pool; and we call 'quicksilver' that which seems to have a 
motion of its own. This is mere popular speech, for properly those 
things alone move of themselves, which do so by virtue of their 
composition of a moving force and matter moved, as things with souls; 
hence these alone are properly said to live:<A HREF="gc1_97a.htm">*</a> 
all other things are moved by some external force, a generating force, 
or a force removing an obstacle, or a force of impact.<A 
HREF="gc1_97b.htm">*</a> And because sensible activities are attended 
with movement, by a further step everything that determines itself to 
its own modes of activity, even though unattended with movement, is 
said to live; hence to understand and desire and feel are vital 
actions.  But God, of all beings, is determined to activity by none 
other than Himself, as He is prime agent and first cause; to Him 
therefore, of all beings, does it belong to live.<p> 

3. The divine being contains the perfection of all being (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>).  But living is perfect being; hence 
animate things in the scale of being take precedence of inanimate. With 
God then to be is to live. This too is confirmed by authority of divine 
Scripture: <i>I will raise to heaven my hand, and swear by my right 
hand, and say: I live for ever</i> (Deut. xxxii, 40): <i>My heart and 
my flesh) have rejoiced in the living God (Ps. lxxiii, 3).
