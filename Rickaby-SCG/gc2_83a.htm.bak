'That the universe is not yet perfect, which is generally admitted,' 
would be more of modern conclusion. In the notion of the perfection of 
the universe we seem to have a <i>judgment of fact</i>, 'the universe 
is the perfect sum of all that is,' slipping into <i>judgment of 
value</i>, 'the universe is the perfect sum of all that ought to be.'
