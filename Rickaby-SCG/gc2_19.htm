<H1>That Creation is not Successive </h1>

Succession is proper to movement. But creation is not movement. 
Therefore there is in it no succession.<p>

2. In every successive movement there is some medium between the 
extremes. But between being and not-being, which are the extremes in 
creation, there can be no medium, and therefore no succession.<p>

3. In every making, in which there is succession, the process of being 
made is before the state of achieved completion. But this cannot happen 
in creation, because, for the process of being made to precede the 
achieved completion of the creature, there would be required some 
subject in which the process might take place. Such a subject cannot be 
the creature itself, of whose creation we are speaking, because that 
creature <i>is</i> not till the state of its achieved completion is 
realised. Nor can it be the Maker, because to be in movement is an 
actuality, not of mover, but of moved. And as for the process of being 
made having for its subject any pre-existing material, that is against 
the very idea of creation. Thus succession is impossible in the act of 
creation.<p>

5. Successive stages in the making of things become necessary, owing to 
defect of the matter, which is not sufficiently disposed from the first 
for the reception of the form. Hence, when the matter is already 
perfectly disposed for the form, it receives it in an instant. Thus 
because a transparent medium is always in final disposition for light, 
it lights up at once in the presence of any actually shining thing. Now 
in creation nothing is prerequisite on the part of the matter, nor is 
anything wanting to the agent for action. It follows that creation 
takes place in an instant: a thing is at once in the act of being 
created and is created, as light is at once being shed and is shining.<p>
