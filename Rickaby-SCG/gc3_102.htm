<H1>That God alone works Miracles</h1>

WHAT is entirely subject to established order cannot work beyond that 
order. But every creature is subject to the order which God has 
established in nature. No creature therefore can work beyond this 
order, which working beyond the order of nature is the meaning of 
working miracles.<p> 

2. When any finite power works the proper effect to which it is 
determined, that is no miracle, though it may surprise one who does not 
understand the operation. But the power of every creature is limited to 
some definite effect, or effects. Whatever therefore is done by the 
power of any creature cannot properly be called a miracle. But what is 
done by the power of God, infinite and incomprehensible, is properly a 
miracle.<p> 

3. Every creature in its action requires some subject to act upon: for 
it belongs to God alone to make a thing out of nothing (B. II, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_21.htm">XXI</a>). But nothing that requires a subject for its 
action can act except to the production of those effects to which that 
subject is in potentiality: for the work of action upon a subject is to 
educe that subject from potentiality to actuality. As then a creature 
can never create, so it can never act upon a thing except to the 
production of that which is in the potentiality of that thing. But in 
many miracles done by divine power a thing is done, which is not in the 
potentiality of that upon which it is done, as in the raising of the 
dead.<p> 

Hence it is said of God: <i>Who doth great wonderful works alone(Ps. 
cxxxv, 4).<A HREF="gc3_102a.htm">*</a>
