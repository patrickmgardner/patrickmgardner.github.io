<A HREF="gc.htm"> Of God and His Creatures</a><hr>

<H1>That the Relations, predicated of God in regard to Creatures, are not 
really in God<A HREF="gc2_12a.htm">*</a></h1>

These relations cannot be in God as accidents in a subject, seeing that 
in God there is no accident (B. I, Chap <A HREF="gc1_23.htm">XXIII</a>). 
Nor again can they be in the very substance of God: for then the 
substance of God in its very essence would be referred to another; but 
what is referred to another for its very essence, in a manner depends 
on that other, as it can neither be nor be understood without it; but 
this would make the substance of God dependent on another being, 
foreign to itself.<p> 

2. God is the first measure of all beings (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>). He is to them as the object is to our 
knowledge, that is to say, its measure. But though the object is spoken 
of in relation to the knowledge of it, nevertheless the relation really 
is not in the object known, but only in the knowledge of it. The object 
is said to be in relation, not because it is itself related, but 
because something else is related to it.<p> 

3. The aforesaid relations are predicated of God, not only in respect 
of things that actually are, but also in respect of things that 
potentially are, because of them also He has knowledge, and in respect 
of them He is called both first being and sovereign good. But what 
actually is bears no real relation to what is not actually but 
potentially. Now God is not otherwise related to things that actually 
are than to things that potentially are, because he is not changed by 
producing anything.<A HREF="gc2_12b.htm">*</a><p> 

4. To whatsoever is added anything fresh, the thing receiving that 
addition must be changed, either essentially or accidentally. Now 
sundry fresh relations are predicated of God, as that He is lord or 
ruler of this thing newly come into being. If then any relation were 
predicated as really existing in God, it would follow that something 
fresh was added to God, and therefore that He had suffered some change, 
either essential or accidental, contrary to what was shown above (B. I, 
Chapp. <A HREF="gc1_23.htm">XXIII</a>, <A HREF="gc1_24.htm">XXIV</a>)
