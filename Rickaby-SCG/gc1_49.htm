<H1>That God knows other things besides Himself</h1>

WE are said to know a thing when we know its cause.  But God
Himself by His essence is the cause of being to others. Since
therefore He knows His own essence most fully, we must suppose
that He knows also other beings.<P>

3. Whoever knows anything perfectly, knows all that can be truly said
of that thing, and all its natural attributes. But a natural attribute of God is
to be cause of other things.  Since then He perfectly knows Himself, He
knows that He is a cause: which could not be unless He knew something
also of what He has caused, which is something different from Himself, for
nothing is its own cause.<P>

Gathering together these two conclusions, it appears that God knows
Himself as the primary and essential object of His knowledge, and other
things as seen in His essence.<A HREF="gc1_49a.htm">*</a>
