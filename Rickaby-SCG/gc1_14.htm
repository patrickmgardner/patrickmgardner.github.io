<H1>That in order to a Knowledge of God we must use the Method of 
Negative Differentiation<A HREF="gc1_14a.htm">*</a></h1> 

AFTER showing that there is a First Being, whom we call God, we must 
enquire into the conditions of His existence. We must use the method of 
negative differentiation, particularly in the consideration of the 
divine substance.  For the divine substance, by its immensity, 
transcends every form that our intellect can realise; and thus we 
cannot apprehend it by knowing what it is, but we have some sort of 
knowledge of it by knowing what it is not.<A HREF="gc1_14b.htm">*</a> 
The more we can negatively differentiate it, or the more attributes we 
can strike off from it in our mind, the more we approach to a knowledge 
of it: for we know each thing more perfectly, the fuller view we have 
of its differences as compared with other things; for each thing has in 
itself a proper being, distinct from all others.  Hence in dealing with 
things that we can define, we first place them in some genus, by which 
we know in general what the thing is; and afterwards we add the 
differentias whereby the thing is distinguished from other things; and 
thus is achieved a complete knowledge of the substance of the thing. 
But because in the study of the divine substance we cannot fix upon 
anything for a genus (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_25.htm">XXV</a>), nor can we 
mark that substance off from other things by affirmative differentias, 
we must determine it by negative differentias. In affirmative 
differentias one limits the extension of another, and brings us nearer 
to a complete designation of the thing under enquiry, inasmuch as it 
makes that thing differ from more and more things. And the same holds 
good also of negative differentias.  For example, we may say that God 
is not an accident, in that He is distinguished from all accidents; 
then if we add that He is not a body, we shall further distinguish Him 
from some substances; and so in order by such negations He will be 
further distinguished from everything besides Himself; and then there 
will be a proper notion of His substance, when He shall be known as 
distinct from all. Still it will not be a perfect knowledge, because He 
will not be known for what He is in Himself.<A 
HREF="gc1_14c.htm">*</a><P> 

To proceed therefore in the knowledge of God by way of negative 
differentiation, let us take as a principle what has been shown in a 
previous chapter, that God is altogether immovable, which is confirmed 
also by the authority of Holy Scripture. For it is said: <i>I am the 
Lord and change not</i> (Mal. iii, 6) ; <i>With whom there is no 
change</i> (James i, 17); <i>God is not as man, that he should change</i> 
(Num. xxiii, 19).<A HREF="gc1_14d.htm">*</a>
