<H1>Whence the performances of Magicians derive their 
Efficacy<A HREF="gc3_105a.htm">*</a></h1>

MAGICIANS in their performances use certain words with a meaning to the 
production of definite effects. Now a word, as meaning something, has 
no power except from some understanding, the understanding either of 
him who utters the word or of him to whom it is uttered: from the 
understanding of the utterer, in the case where a word is of such power 
that by the idea which it contains it is apt to produce real effects, 
the idea being applied to the production of those effects by the 
ministry of the voice: from the understanding of the person addressed, 
in the case when the hearer is induced to do something by the reception 
into his understanding of the idea conveyed by the word. Now it cannot 
be said that those words, uttered by magicians with a meaning, have 
their efficacy from the understanding of him who utters them.       
For, since power follows upon essence, difference of power argues a 
difference of essential principle. But we find the condition of the 
understanding of men generally to be such that it is more true to say 
that its cognition is caused by things than that any idea which it 
conceives can be the cause of things. If then there are any men who    
by words expressive of the concept of their understanding can change 
things one into another, and do that by power of their own (<i>res 
possint transmutare propria virtute</i>), they must be beings of 
another species from ordinary mortals, and cannot be called men in the 
sense in which others are men (<i>dicentur aequivoce homines</i>).<A 
HREF="gc3_105b.htm">*</a>  The alternative is to suppose that such 
effects are accomplished by the understanding of some person, to whom 
the speech of him who utters such words is addressed. This supposition 
has its confirmation in the fact that the expressions which magicians 
use consist of invocations, entreaties, adjurations, or even commands, 
as of one person talking with another.<p> 

Besides, in the ceremonies of this art they employ certain characters 
and geometrical figures. But a figure is no principle of action, 
imparted or received: or else mathematical drawings would be active and 
passive. Matter therefore cannot be disposed by geometrical figures to 
the reception of any natural effect. It follows that these figures are 
not used as disposing causes, but as signs. Now we use signs only to 
address other intelligent beings. Magical arts therefore owe their 
efficacy to some intelligence, to whom the speech of the magician is 
addressed, -- as is also shown by the sacrifices, prostrations, and other 
rites employed, which can be nothing else but signs of reverence paid 
to some intelligent nature.
