<h1>Of the Last judgement</h1>

THERE is a twofold retribution for the things that a man has done in 
life, one for his soul immediately upon its separation from the body, 
another at the resurrection of the body. The first retribution is to 
individuals severally, as individuals severally die: the second is to 
all men together, as all men shall rise together. Therefore there must 
be a twofold judgement: one of individuals, regarding the soul; another 
a general judgement, rendering to all men their due in soul and body. 
And because Christ in His Humanity, wherein He suffered and rose again, 
has merited for us resurrection and life everlasting, it belongs to 
Him to exercise that judgement whereby risen men are rewarded or 
punished, for so it is said of Him: <i>He hath given him authority to 
exercise judgement, because he is the Son of Man</i> (John v, 27). And 
further, since in the last judgement there will be question of the 
reward or punishment of persons present in visible bodily shape, it is 
fitting for that judgement to be a visible process. Hence Christ will 
take His seat as judge in human shape, so that all can see Him, good 
and bad. But the vision of His Godhead, which makes men blessed, will 
be visible only to the good. As for the judgement of souls, that is an 
invisible process, dealing with invisible beings.
