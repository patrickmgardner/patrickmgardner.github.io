<H1>That God does not hear all Prayers</h1>

THERE is no anomaly in the prayers of petitioners being sometimes not 
granted by God. For God fulfils the desires of His rational creature 
inasmuch as that creature desires good: but sometimes it happens that 
what is asked is not true but seeming good, which is simply evil: such 
a prayer is not within the hearing of God. Hence it is said: <i>Ye ask 
and receive not, because ye ask amiss</i> (James iv, 3).<p> 

2. It is suitable that God should fulfil our desires in so far as He 
moves us to desire. If therefore the movement of desire on our part is 
not kept up by earnestness in prayer, there is nothing to be surprised 
at if the prayer does not gain its due effect. Hence the Lord [St Luke] 
says: <i>We ought always to pray and not to faint</i> (Luke xviii, 1); 
and the Apostle, <i>Pray without ceasing</i> (i Thess. v, 17).<p> 

3. It befits God to hear the prayer of the rational creature inasmuch 
as that creature draws nigh to Him. But one draws nigh to God by 
contemplation and devout affection and humble and firm intention. That 
prayer therefore which does not so draw nigh to God is not within God's 
hearing. Hence it is said: <i>He hath regarded the prayer of the 
humble</i> (Ps. ci, 18); and, <i>Let him ask in faith, debating not 
within himself</i> (James i, 6).<p> 

4. God hears the prayers of the pious on the ground of friendship. He 
then who turns away from the friendship of God is not worthy to have 
his prayer heard.<A HREF="gc3_96a.htm">*</a> Hence it is said: 
<i>Whosoever turns away his ear from hearing the law, his prayer shall 
be abominable</i> (Prov.  xxviii, 9): <i>Though ye multiply prayers, I 
will not hear: for your hands are full of blood</i> (Isai. i, 15). This 
is why sometimes a friend of God is not heard, when he prays for those 
who are not God's friends, as it was said: <i>Do not thou pray for this 
people, nor take unto thee praise and supplication for them, and do not 
withstand me: for I will not hear thee</i> (Jerem. vii, 16).<p> 

It happens sometimes that for very friendship one denies his friend's 
petition, knowing it to be hurtful to him, or the contrary to be better 
for him, as a physician refuses what his patient asks for. No wonder 
then if God, who fulfils the desires put before Him by His rational 
creature for the love that He bears to that creature, fails sometimes 
to fulfil the petition of those whom He singularly loves, that He may 
fulfil it otherwise with something more helpful to the salvation of the 
petitioner, as we read in 2 Cor. xii, 7-9; and the Lord says to some: 
<i>Ye know not what ye ask</i> (Matt. xx, 22). Therefore Augustine says 
(<i>Ep. ad Paulin. et Theras.</i>): "The Lord is good in often not 
giving what we will, to give instead what we should prefer."
