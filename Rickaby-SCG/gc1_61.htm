<H1>That God is pure Truth</h1>

THE understanding is not liable to error in its knowledge of 
abstract being, as neither is sense in dealing with the proper 
object of each sense.<A HREF="gc1_61a.htm">*</a>  But all the 
knowledge of the divine mind is after the manner of a mind 
knowing abstract being (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_58.htm">LVIII</a>): it 
is impossible therefore for error or deception or falsehood to 
creep into the cognitive act of God.<P>

3. The intellect does not err over first principles, but over 
reasoned conclusions from first principles. But the divine 
intellect is not reasoning or argumentative (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_57.htm">LVII</a>), and is therefore not liable to 
deception.<A HREF="gc1_61b.htm">*</a><P>

4. The higher any cognitive faculty is, the more universal and 
far-reaching is its proper object: hence what sight is cognisant 
of accidentally,<A HREF="gc1_61c.htm">*</a> general sensibility 
or imagination seizes upon as a content of its proper object. But 
the power of the divine mind is the acme of cognitive power: 
therefore all things knowable stand to it as proper and ordinary 
objects of knowledge, not as accidental objects. But over proper 
and ordinary objects of knowledge a cognitive faculty never makes 
a mistake.<P>

5. An intellectual virtue is a perfection of the understanding in 
knowing. It never happens that the understanding utters anything 
false, but its utterance is always true, when prompted by any 
intellectual virtue; for it is the part of virtue to render an 
act good, and to utter truth is the good act of the 
understanding. But the divine mind, being the acme of perfection, 
is more perfect by its nature than the human mind by any habit of 
virtue.<P>

6. The knowledge of the human mind is in a manner caused by 
things: hence it comes to be that things knowable are the measure 
of human knowledge: for the judgement of the mind is true, 
because the thing is so. But the divine mind by its knowledge is 
the cause of things.<A HREF="gc1_61d.htm">*</a> Hence God's 
knowledge must be the measure of things, as art is the measure of 
products of art, whereof the perfection of each varies according 
to its agreement with art. Thus the divine mind stands to things 
as things stand to the human mind.  But any error that arises out 
of any inequality between the human mind and the thing  is not in 
things, but in the mind.  If therefore there were not an 
absolutely perfect correspondence of the divine mind with things, 
the error would be in the things, not in the divine mind. There 
is however no error in the things that be: because each has so 
much of truth as it has of being. There is then no failure of 
correspondence between the divine mind and the things that be.<P>

Hence it is said: <i>God is truthful</i> (Rom. iii, 4): <i>God is 
not like man, that he should lie</i> (Num. xxiii, 19): <i>God is 
light, and there is no darkness in him</i> (1 John i, 5).
