<H1>That Subsistent Intelligences have Free Will</h1>

THEY must be free, if they have dominion over their own acts.<p>

2. A free agent is an agent that is cause of its own action (<i>sui 
causa, sibi causa agendi</i>). Agents that are determined 
(<i>moventur</i>) and act only inasmuch as they are determined by 
others, are not causes of their own acts. Only self-determining agents 
(<i>moventia seipsa</i>) have liberty of action; and these alone are 
guided in their action by judgement. A self-determining agent is made 
up of two elements, one determining and another determined. The element 
determined is the appetite; and that is determined either by intellect, 
or by phantasy, or by sense: for to these powers it belongs to judge. 
Of such self-determining agents, those alone judge freely which 
determine their own judgement. But no faculty of judging determines its 
own judgement unless it reflects upon its own act. If then it is to 
determine itself to judge, it must know its own judgement; and that 
knowledge belongs to intellect alone. Irrational animals then have a 
sort of free determination, or action, but not a free judgement 
(<i>sunt quodammodo liberi quidem motus, sive actionis, non autem liberi 
judicii</i>):<A HREF="gc2_48a.htm">*</a> while inanimate things, being 
dependent for their every determination on things other than 
themselves, have not so much as free action, or determination. On the 
contrary, intelligent beings have not only free action, but also free 
judgement, which is having free will.<A HREF="gc2_48b.htm">*</a><p> 

3. An apprehension becomes a motive according as the thing apprehended 
takes the form of something good or suitable. In agents that determine 
their own movements,<A HREF="gc2_48c.htm">*</a> the outward action goes 
upon some judgement pronouncing a thing good or suitable according as 
it is apprehended. If the agent pronouncing the judgement is to 
determine himself to judge,<A HREF="gc2_48e.htm">*</a> he must be 
guided to that judgement by some higher form or idea in his 
apprehension.<A HREF="gc2_48f.htm">*</a> This idea can be no other 
than the universal idea (<i>ipsa ratio</i>) of goodness or fitness, by 
aid whereof a judgement is formed of any given definite good, fit, or 
suitable thing. Therefore those agents alone determine themselves to 
judge, which have this general concept of goodness or fitness, -- that 
is to say, only intelligent agents. Therefore intelligent agents alone 
determine themselves, not only to act, but also to judge. They 
therefore alone are free in judging, which is having free will.<p> 

4. No movement or action follows from a general concept except by the 
medium of some particular apprehension, as all movement and action 
deals with particulars. Now the understanding naturally apprehends the 
universal. In order then that movement or any manner of action may 
follow upon the intellectual apprehension, the universal concept of the 
understanding must be applied to particular objects. But the universal 
contains in potentiality many particular objects. Therefore the 
application of the intellectual concept may be made to many divers 
objects; and consequently the judgement of the understanding about 
things to be done is not determined to one thing only.<A 
HREF="gc2_48g.htm">*</a><p>

5. Some agents are without liberty of judgement, either because they 
have no judgement at all, as is the case with things that have no 
knowledge, as stones and plants, or because they have a judgement 
naturally determined to one effect, as irrational animals. For by 
natural reckoning<A HREF="gc2_48h.htm">*</a> the sheep judges that the 
wolf is hurtful to it, and on this judgement flies from the wolf. But 
whatever agents have their judgement of things to be done not 
determined by nature to one effect, they must have free will. Such are 
all intelligent agents; for the understanding apprehends, not only this 
or that good, but good itself in general. Hence, since it is through 
the idea in apprehension that the understanding moves the will; and in 
all things the motive, or moving power, and the object moved must be 
proportioned to one another; it follows that the will of an intelligent 
subsistent being is not determined by nature except to good in general. 
Whatever therefore is presented to the will under the specific notion 
of good (<i>sub ratione boni</i>), the will may incline to it, without 
let or hindrance from any natural determination to the contrary. 
Therefore all intelligent agents have free will, arising out of the 
judgement of the understanding; and free will is defined 'a free 
judgement on the matter of a specific notion, or general concept.'<A
