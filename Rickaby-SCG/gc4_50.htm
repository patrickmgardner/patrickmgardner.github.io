<H1>That Original Sin is transmitted from our First Parent to his 
Posterity</h1>

THIS expressly appears from the words of the Apostle: <i>As by one man 
sin came into the world, and by sin death, so death passed on to all 
men, seeing that all have sinned</i> (Rom. V, 12)<A 
HREF="gc4_50a.htm">*</a>. It cannot be said that by one man sin entered 
into the world by way of imitation, because in that interpretation sin 
would have reached only to those who imitate the first man in sinning; 
and since by sin death came into the world, death would reach only 
those who sin in the likeness of the first man that sinned. But to 
exclude this interpretation the Apostle adds: <i>Death reigned from 
Adam to Moses even over those who did not sin in the likeness of the 
transgression of Adam</i>. The Apostle's meaning therefore was not that 
by one man sin entered into the world in the way of imitation, but in 
the way of origin.<p> 

Moreover, the common custom of the Church is to administer baptism to 
new-born children. But there would be no purpose in such 
administration, unless there were sin in them. If it is said that the 
purpose of infant baptism is not the cleansing of sin, but the arriving 
at the kingdom of God, the saying is nonsensical. They who say so, 
appeal to our Lord's words: <i>Unless a man be born again of water and 
the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God</i> (John iii, 
5).<A HREF="gc4_50b.htm">*</a> The fact is, no one is excluded from 
the kingdom of God except for some fault. For the end of every rational 
creature is to arrive at happiness; which happiness can be only in the 
kingdom of God; which kingdom again is nothing else than the organised 
society of those who enjoy the vision of God, in which true happiness 
consists (B. III, Chap. <A HREF="gc3_63.htm">LXIII</a>).<A 
HREF="gc4_50c.htm">*</a> But nothing fails to gain its end except 
through some fault or flaw. If then unbaptised children cannot arrive 
at the kingdom of God, we must say that there is some fault, flaw, or 
sin in them.
