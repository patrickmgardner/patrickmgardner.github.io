I have been at considerable pains to explain and vindicate this 
argument in my <i>Ethics and Natural Law</i>, pp. 13-21. The 
alternative to the acceptance of it is the view of Professor Stewart, -- 
and, no doubt, of Aristotle: -- "The <b>the&ocirc;r&ecirc;tikos 
bios</b> is an ideal: it cannot be realised by man, for he is concrete. 
But the effort to realise it, so far as possible, is all important in 
human life. The effort to realise it co-ordinates man's powers, it 
gives him <i>&eacute;lan</i>, and carries him on to the attainment of 
many things within his reach, which he would not otherwise aspire to" 
(Stewart's <i>Notes on Nicomachean Ethics</i>, II, 448). Is man then a 
<i>lusus naturae</i>, who wins an insufficient pittance in repeated 
doles by ever asking for more? Is this what Ecclesiastes xii calls 
<i>all man</i>? We have then the fourth petition of the Lord's Prayer 
granted to the rejection of the second, which scarcely looks like the 
fulfilment of the third. We have daily bread, but no kingdom come. We 
have the race progressing indefinitely, but all individual progress 
ending at no long time in a plunge into nothingness. Is not the case 
the same with all other animal life and with the whole vegetable world? 
To be sure it is, but man alone knows it, and his knowledge is his 
misfortune.
