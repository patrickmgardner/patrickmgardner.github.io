The Greek dread is well known of the envy, or
evil eye, of Heaven lighting upon any exuberance of
human prosperity. See the story of Polycrates and his
ring in Herodotus, III, 41. Julius Caesar and Augustus 
felt this dread, nor is it yet extinct. Aeschylus
philosophises upon it (<i>Agam.</i> 750-762). 
Cf. Daniel iv, 29-34; St Luke xii, 16-21.
