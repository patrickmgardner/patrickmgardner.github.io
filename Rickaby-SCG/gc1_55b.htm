The argument is this.  The mind cannot resolve 
itself into several distinct and independent things at 
once: but unify those things somehow, subordinate 
and make a whole of them, so doing the mind can 
'be all those things,' that is to say, it makes to itself
a representation of them altogether, regarding them as
one, lumping them together from one point of view.
