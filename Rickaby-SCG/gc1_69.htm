<H1>That God knows infinite things<A HREF="gc1_69a.htm">*</a></h1>

BY knowing Himself as the cause of things, He knows things other than 
Himself (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_49.htm">XLIX</a>).  But He is the cause of 
infinite things, if beings are infinite, for He is the cause of all 
things that are.<A HREF="gc1_69b.htm">*</a><P> 

2. God knows His own power perfectly (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_47.htm>XLVII</a>, <A HREF="gc1_49.htm">XLIX</a>).  But power 
cannot be perfectly known, unless all the objects to which it extends 
are known, since according to that extent the amount of the power may 
be said to be determined. But His power being infinite (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_43.htm">XLIII</a>) extends to things infinite, and therefore 
also His knowledge.<P> 

3. If the knowledge of God extends to all things that in any sort of 
way are, He must not only know actual being, but also potential being. 
But in the physical world there is potential infinity, though not 
actual infinity, as the Philosopher proves. God therefore knows 
infinite things, in the way that unity, which is the principle of 
number, would know infinite species of number if it knew whatever is in 
its potentiality: for unity is in promise and potency every number.<A 
HREF="gc1_69c.htm">*</a><P> 

4. God in His essence, as in a sort of exemplar medium, knows other 
things. But as He is a being of infinite perfection, there can be 
modelled upon Him infinite copies with finite perfections, because no 
one of these copies, nor any number of them put together, can come up 
to the perfection of their exemplar; and thus there always remains some 
new way for any copy taken to imitate Him.<P> 

10. The infinite defies knowledge in so far as it defies counting. To 
count the parts of the infinite is an intrinsic impossibility, as 
involving a contradiction.  To know a thing by enumeration of its 
parts is characteristic of a mind that knows part after part 
successively, not of a mind that comprehends the several parts 
together.  Since then the divine mind knows all things together 
without succession, it has no more difficulty in knowing things 
infinite than in knowing things finite.<P>

11. All quantity consists in a certain multiplication of parts; and 
therefore number is the first of quantities.<A HREF="gc1_69d.htm">*</a> 
Where then plurality makes no difference, no difference can be made 
there by anything that follows upon quantity. But in God's knowledge 
many things are known in one, not by many different presentations, but 
by that one <i>species</i>, or presentation, which is the essence of God.  
Hence a multitude of things is known by God all at once; and thus 
plurality makes no difference in God's knowledge: neither then does 
infinity, which follows upon quantity.<P>

In accordance with this is what is said in Psalm cxlvi: <i>And of his 
wisdom there is no telling</i>.<P>

From what has been said it is clear why our mind does not know the 
infinite as the divine mind does.  Our mind differs from the divine 
mind in four respects; and they make all the difference.  The first is 
that our mind is simply finite, the divine mind infinite. The second is 
that as our mind knows different things by different impressions, it 
cannot extend to an infinity of things, as the divine mind can.  The 
third results in this way, that as our mind is cognisant of different 
things by different impressions, it cannot be actually cognisant of a 
multitude of things at the same time;<A HREF="gc1_69e.htm">*</a> and 
thus it could not know an infinity of things except by counting them in 
succession, which is not the case with the divine mind, which discerns 
many things at once as seen by one presentation.  The fourth thing is 
that the divine mind is cognisant of things that are and of things that 
are not (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_66.htm">LXVI</a>).<P> 

It is also clear how the saying of the Philosopher, that the infinite, 
as infinite, is unknowable, is in no opposition with the opinion now 
put forth: because the notion of infinity attaches to quantity; 
consequently, for infinite to be known as infinite, it would have to be 
known by the measurement of its parts, for that is the proper way of 
knowing quantity: but God does not know the infinite in that way. 
Hence, so to say, God does not know the infinite inasmuch as it is 
infinite, but inasmuch as, to His knowledge, it is as though it were 
finite.<A HREF="gc1_69f.htm">*</a><P> 

It is to be observed however that God does not know an infinity of 
things with the 'knowledge of vision,' because infinite things neither 
actually are, nor have been, nor shall be, since, according to the 
Catholic faith, there are not infinite generations either in point of 
time past or in point of time to come.  But He does know an infinity of 
things with the 'knowledge of simple understanding': for He knows 
infinite things that neither are, nor have been, nor shall be, and yet 
are in the power of the creature;<A HREF="gc1_69g.htm">*</a> and He 
also knows infinite things that are in His own power, which neither 
are, nor shall be, nor have been. Hence to the question of the 
knowledge of particular things it may be replied by denial of the 
major: for particular things are not infinite: if however they were, 
God would none the less know them.<A HREF="gc1_69h.htm">*</a>
