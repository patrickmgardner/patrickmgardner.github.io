I believe that St Thomas had no knowledge of Plato at first hand, not 
even in a Latin translation. He knew him only through the citations of 
Aristotle, and commentators, mostly Neoplatonists. For the opinion here 
ascribed to Plato, see Plato's <i>Phaedo</i>, pp. 80, 94; 
<i>Phaedrus</i>, 245, 246; <i>Laws</i>, 896, 897. It appears not so 
much explicitly in any one passage, as implicitly in the general tenor 
of Plato's philosophy, especially in the strong opposition, and even 
repugnance, which he supposes to obtain between soul and body; in his 
doctrine of the pre-existence of soul before body, also of the 
transmigration of souls (which argues a very loose connection between 
the soul and the particular body which it inhabits): likewise in this 
general difference between Aristotelian and Platonic 'forms,' that 
while Aristotle's 'forms' inhere in sensible things, Plato's 'forms,' 
or <b>eide</b>, stand apart; so that even though Plato had allowed the 
soul to be the 'form' of the body, which he did not allow, still even 
so he would have kept this 'form' apart from and independent of the 
body.  Plato in fact detested material substance, and would not have 
spirit bound up with matter.  Spirit was to rule matter; and when for 
its punishment it got entangled in matter, as in man, and still more in 
the lower animals, it was to do its best to break away, and (in man) to 
live a life of its own, as much apart from the body and bodily senses 
as possible.
