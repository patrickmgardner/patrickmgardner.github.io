<h1>The Explanation of a Text</h1>

NOR is there anything contrary to the tradition of the Church in the 
word of the Lord saying to the disciples, who seemed scandalised: 
<i>The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life</i> (John 
vi, 63). He did not thereby give them to understand that His true flesh 
was not delivered to be eaten by the faithful in this Sacrament, but 
that it was not delivered to be eaten in the way of ordinary flesh, 
taken and torn with the teeth in its own proper appearance, as food 
usually is; that it is received in a spiritual way, not in the usual 
way of fleshly food.
