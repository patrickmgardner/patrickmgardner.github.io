<H1>Arguments against the aforsesaid Conclusion, with Answers to the 
same</h1> 

ARG. 1.  Evil is a specific difference in certain kinds of things, 
namely, in moral habits and acts: for as every virtue in its species is 
a good habit, so the contrary vice in its species is an evil habit; and 
similarly of acts.  Evil therefore is something that gives species to 
certain things: it is therefore an essence, and natural to some 
things.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i>  The reason why good and evil are reckoned specific 
differences in moral matters, is because moral matters depend on the 
will: for a thing enters into the sphere of morality inasmuch as it is 
voluntary.  But the object of the will is the end in view and good: 
hence moral actions are specified by the end for which they are done, 
as physical actions are from the form of their active principle.  Since 
then good and evil are designated according to due bearing on the end, 
or the lack of such due bearing, good and evil must be the first 
differentias marking species in moral matters.  But the measure of 
morality is reason.  Therefore things must be called morally good or 
evil according as they bear on the end which reason determines.  
Whatever therefore in moral matters derives its species from an end, 
which is according to reason, is said to be good in its species: while 
what derives its species from an end contrary to reason, is said to be 
evil in its species.  But that end, though inconsistent with the end 
which reason assigns, is nevertheless some sort of good, as being 
pleasurable according to sense, or the like: hence such ends are good 
in some animals, and even in man when they are moderated by reason; and 
what is evil for one may very well be good for another. And therefore 
evil, inasmuch as it is a specific differentia in the genus of moral 
matters, does not involve anything that is essentially evil, but 
something that is in itself good, but evil to man inasmuch as it sets 
aside the order of reason, which is man's good.<p> 

<i>Arg. 4.</i>  All that acts is something.  But evil acts inasmuch as 
it is evil: for it understands good and spoils it.  Evil therefore, 
inasmuch as it is evil, is some thing.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i> A privation, as such, is no principle of action.  Hence 
it is well said that evil does not fight against good except in the 
power of good: but in itself it is impotent and weak and originative of 
no action.  Evil is said however to spoil good also formally in itself, 
as blindness is said to spoil sight, or whiteness to colour a wall.<p> 

<i>Arg. 5.</i>  Where there is found <i>more</i> and <i>less</i>, there 
must be an order of things, for negations and privations are not 
susceptible of <i>more</i> and <i>less</i>.  But we find among evils 
one worse than another.  Therefore evil must be some thing.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i>  Conditions that imply privation are intensified or 
relaxed as are inequality and unlikeness: for a thing is more unequal 
according as it is further removed from inequality, and more unlike 
according as it is more removed from likeness: hence a thing is more 
evil according as it is a greater privation of good, or at a greater 
distance from good.<A HREF="gc3_8a.htm">*</a> <p> 

<i>Arg. 6.</i>  Thing and being are convertible terms.  But evil is in 
the world. Therefore it is some thing and nature.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i>  Evil is said 'to be' in the world, not as having any 
essence, or existing as a thing, but in the way in which a thing 'is' 
evil precisely by evil, as blindness, an in the way in which any 
privation is said 'to be,' inasmuch as an animal 'is' blind by 
blindness.  For there are two senses of 'being': in one sense it means 
the essence of a thing, and is divided into the ten predicaments;<A 
HREF="gc3_8b.htm">*</a>  and in this sense no privation can be called a 
being: in another sense, it signifies the truth of an affirmative 
proposition (<i>veritatem compositionis</i>); and thus evil and 
privation is said to be a being, inasmuch as a thing is said to 'be' 
thereby under a privation.
