<H1>That Intelligences subsisting apart are not more than one in the same 
Species<A HREF="gc2_93a.htm">*</a></h1>

INTELLIGENCES subsisting apart are subsistent essences. Now the 
definition of a thing being the mark of its essence, is the mark of its 
species. Subsistent essences therefore are subsistent species.<p>

2. Difference in point of form begets difference of species, while 
difference in point of matter begets difference in number. But 
intelligences subsisting apart have nothing whatever of matter about 
them. Therefore it is impossible for them to be several in one 
species.<p>

4. The multiplication of species adds more nobility and perfection to 
the universe than the multiplication of individuals in the same 
species. But the perfection of the universe consists principally 
in intelligences subsisting apart. Therefore it makes more for the 
perfection of the universe that there should be many intelligences 
different in species than many different in number in the same 
species.<A HREF="gc2_93b.htm">*</a>
