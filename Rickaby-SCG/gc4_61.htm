<h1>Of the Eucharist</h1>

BECAUSE spiritual effects are produced on the pattern of visible 
effects, it was fitting that our spiritual nourishment should be given 
us under the appearances of those things that men commonly use for 
their bodily nourishment, namely bread and wine. And for the further 
correspondence of spiritual signs with bodily effects, in the spiritual 
regeneration of Baptism the mystery of the Word Incarnate is united 
with us otherwise than as it is united in this Sacrament of the 
Eucharist, which is our spiritual nourishment. In Baptism the Word 
Incarnate is only virtually contained, but in the Sacrament of the 
Eucharist we confess Him to be contained substantially, as nourishment 
must be substantially united with the nourished.<p> 

And because the completion of our salvation was wrought by Christ's 
passion and death, whereby His Blood was separated from His Body, 
therefore the Sacrament of His Body is given us separately under the 
species of bread, and His Blood under the species of wine.<A
