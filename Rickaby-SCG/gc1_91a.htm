<i>Quod Deus est Amor</i>, is the heading of the chapter: 
but all the conclusion argued and drawn in the
text is "that God loves," "that there is love in God."
<i>God is love</i>, and <i>God is light</i>, says St John (I 
John iv, 9; i, 5); and, owing to the divine simplicity (Chap.  
XVIII), it may be argued that whatever attribute is
in God, is God.
