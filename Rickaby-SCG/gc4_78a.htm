Again, rather a wide definition of a Sacrament.
It must be borne in mind that the priest is not the
minister of the Sacrament of Matrimony. The Sacrament 
is the contract of baptised man with baptised
woman; and the contracting parties administer the
Sacrament to one another in their agreement to live
together perpetually as man and wife. Where the law
of Trent is promulgated, the presence of the parish priest
is necessary to the ecclesiastical validity of the contract,
and therefore of the Sacrament. The proof that Matrimony 
is a Sacrament, rests on a close study of Ephesians 
v, 22-33, joined with the declarations of the
Council of Trent. I hardly need say that the proof
is not complete in the one word <i>sacramentum</i>,
<b>must&ecirc;rion</b>, (verse 32).
