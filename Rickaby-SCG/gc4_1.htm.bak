<i>LO, these things that have been said are but a part of his ways; and 
whereas we have heard scarce one little drop of his speech, who shall 
be able to look upon the thunder of his greatness?</i> (Job xxvi, 14.) 
It is the nature of the human mind to gather its knowledge from 
sensible things; nor can it of itself arrive at the direct vision of 
the divine substance, as that substance is in itself raised above all 
sensible things and all other beings to boot, and beyond all proportion 
with them. But because the perfect good of man consists in his knowing 
God in such way as he can, there is given man a way of ascending to the 
knowledge of God, to the end that so noble a creature should not seem 
to exist altogether in vain, unable to attain the proper end of his 
existence. The way is this, that as all the perfections of creatures 
descend in order from God, who is the height of perfection, man should 
begin from the lower creatures, and ascend by degrees, and so advance 
to the knowledge of God. Of this descent of perfections from God there 
are two processes. One is on the part of the first origin of things: 
for the divine wisdom, to make things perfect, produced them in order, 
that the universe might consist of a complete round of creatures from 
highest to lowest. The other process belongs to the things themselves: 
for, as causes are nobler than effects, the first and highest products 
of causation, while falling short of the First Cause, which is God, 
nevertheless are superior to the effects which they themselves produce; 
and so on in order, until we come to the lowest of creatures.<A 
HREF="gc4_1b.htm">*</a> And because in that 'roof and crown of all 
things' (<i>summo rerum vertice</i>), God, we find the most perfect 
unity; and everything is stronger and more excellent, the more 
thoroughly it is one; it follows that diversity and variety increase in 
things, the further they are removed from Him who is the first 
principle of all. Therefore the process of derivation of creatures from 
their first principle may be represented by a sort of pyramid, with 
unity at the apex, and the widest multiplicity at the base.<A 
HREF="gc4_1c.htm">*</a> And thus in the diversity of things there is 
apparent a diversity of ways, beginning from one principle and 
terminating in different terms. By these ways then our understanding 
can ascend to God.<p> 

But the weakness of our understanding prevents us from knowing these 
ways perfectly. Our knowledge begins with sense; and sense is concerned 
with exterior accidents (phenomena), which are of themselves sensible, 
as colour, smell, and the like. With difficulty can our mind penetrate 
through such exterior phenomena to an inner knowledge of things, even 
where it perfectly grasps by sense their accidents.<A 
HREF="gc4_1d.htm">*</a> Much less will it be able to attain to a 
comprehension of the natures of those objects of which we perceive only 
a few phenomena by sense;<A HREF="gc4_1e.htm">*</a> and still less of 
those natures no accidents of which lie open to sense, but certain 
effects which they produce, inadequate to their power, enable us to 
recognise them.<A HREF="gc4_1f.htm">*</a> But even though the very 
natures of things were known to us, still we should have but slight 
knowledge of their order, of their mutual relations, and direction by 
divine providence to their final end, since we cannot penetrate the 
plan of Providence.<A HREF="gc4_1g.htm">*</a> The ways themselves then 
being so imperfectly known to us, how shall we travel by them to any 
perfect knowledge of the First Beginning of all things, which 
transcends all created ways and is out of all proportion with them? 
Even though we knew the said ways perfectly, we should still fall short 
of perfect knowledge of their origin and starting-point.<A 
HREF="gc4_1h.htm">*</a><p> 

Feeble and inadequate then being any knowledge to which man could 
arrive by these ways, God has revealed to men facts about Himself which 
surpass human understanding; in which revelation there is observed an 
order of gradual transition from imperfect to perfect. In man's present 
state, in which his understanding is tied to sense, his mind cannot 
possibly be elevated to any clear discernment of truths that surpass 
all proportions of sense: in that state the revelation is given him, 
not to be understood, but to be heard and believed.<A 
HREF="gc4_1i.htm">*</a> Only when he is delivered from the thraldom of 
sensible things, will he be elevated to an intuition of revealed truth. 
Thus there is a threefold knowledge that man may have of divine things. 
The first is an ascent through creatures to the knowledge of God by the 
natural light of reason. The second is a descent of divine truth by 
revelation to us; truth exceeding human understanding; truth accepted, 
not as demonstrated to sight, but as orally delivered for belief. The 
third is an elevation of the human mind to a perfect insight into 
things revealed.<p> 

This triple knowledge is suggested by the text above quoted from Job. 
<i>These things that have been said are but a part of his ways</i>, 
applies to that knowledge whereby our understanding ascends by way of 
creatures to a knowledge of God. And because we know these ways but 
imperfectly, that is rightly put in, <i>but a part</i>, for <i>we know 
in part</i> (i Cor. xiii, 9). The next clause, <i>and whereas we have 
heard scarce one little drop of his speech</i>, refers to the second 
knowledge, whereby divine truths are revealed for our belief by means 
of oral declaration: for <i>faith is hearing, and hearing by the word 
of Christ</i> (Rom. x, 17). And because this imperfect knowledge is an 
effluent from that perfect knowledge whereby divine truth is seen in 
itself, -- a revelation from God by the ministry of angels, who <i>see 
the face of the Father</i> (Matt. xviii, 10),<A HREF="gc4_1j.htm">*</a> 
he rightly terms it a drop, as it is written: <i>In that day the 
mountains shall drop sweetness</i> (Joel iii, 18). But because 
revelation does not take in all the mysteries which the angels and the 
rest of the blessed behold in the First Truth, there is a meaning in 
the qualification, <i>one little drop</i>: for it is said: <i>Who shall 
magnify him as he is from the beginning? many things are hidden greater 
than these, for we see but a few of his works</i> (Ecclus xliii, 35): 
<i>I have many things to say to you, but ye cannot hear them now</i> 
(John xvi, 2). These few points that are revealed to us are set forth 
under similitudes and obscurities of expression, so as to be accessible 
only to the studious, hence the expressive addition, scarce, marking 
the difficulty of the enquiry. The third clause, <i>who shall be able 
to look upon the thunder of his greatness?</i> points to the third 
knowledge, whereby the First Truth shall be known, not as believed, but 
as seen: <i>for we shall see him as he is</i> (1 John iii, 2). No 
little fragment of the divine mysteries will be perceived, but the 
Divine Majesty itself, and all the perfect array of good things: hence 
the Lord said to Moses: <i>I will show thee all good</i> (Exod. xxxiii, 
19). Rightly therefore we have in the text the words <i>look upon his 
greatness</i>. And this truth shall not be proposed to man under the 
covering of any veils, but quite plain: hence the Lord says to His 
disciples: <i>The hour cometh, when I will no longer speak to you in 
proverbs, but will tell you openly of my Father</i> (John xvi, 25): 
hence [the] word <i>thunder</i> in the text, indicative of this plain 
showing.<p> 

The words of the above text are adapted to our purpose: for whereas in 
the previous books we have spoken of divine things according as natural 
reason can arrive through creatures to the knowledge of them, -- but 
that imperfectly, according to the limitations of the author's 
capacity, so that we can say with Job: <i>Lo, these things that have 
been said are but a part of his ways</i>; it remains now to treat of 
truths divinely revealed for our belief, truths transcending human 
understanding. And the words of the text are a guide to our procedure 
in this matter. As we have scarce heard the truth in the statements of 
Holy Scripture, those being as it were one little drop coming down to 
us, and no man in this life can look upon the thunder of his greatness, 
our method will be as follows. Taking as first principles the 
statements of Holy Scripture, we will endeavour to penetrate their 
hidden meaning to the best of our ability, without presuming to claim 
perfect knowledge of the matter. Our proofs will rest on the authority 
of Holy Scripture, not on natural reason: still it will be our duty to 
show that our assertions are not contrary to natural reason, and 
thereby defend them against the assaults of unbelievers. And since 
natural reason ascends by creatures to the knowledge of God, while the 
knowledge of faith descends by divine revelation from God to us, and it 
is the same way up and down, we must proceed in these matters of 
supra-rational belief by the same way in which we proceeded in our 
rational enquiries concerning God. Thus we shall treat first of the 
supra-rational truths that are proposed for our belief concerning God 
Himself, as the confession of the Trinity [Chapp. I - XXVI: cf. I, 
Chap. <A HREF="gc1_9.htm">IX</a>: this answers to Book I]. Secondly, 
of the supra-rational works done by God, as the work of the Incarnation 
and its consequences [Chapp. XXVII - LXXVIII: answering to Book II]. 
Thirdly, of the supra-rational events expected at the end of human 
history, as the resurrection and glorification of bodies, the 
everlasting bliss of souls, and events therewith connected [Chapp. 
LXXIX - XCVII: answering to Book III].
