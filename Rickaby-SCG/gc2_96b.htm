A 'term of intelligence' (<i>intelligibile</i>) is what answers to a 
universal concept: it is the scientific aspect of a thing 
(<i>ratio</i>, [Chap. <A HREF="gc2_48.htm">XLVIII</a> note <A 
HREF="gc2_48i.htm">I</a>]), what we call the 'principle' of 
a thing, as of 'youth,' 'manhood,' 'tree,' 'steam-engine,' as 
distinguished from the embodiment of that principle in these and those 
particular materials. It is the <b>logos</b>, not the 
<b>path&ecirc;</b>. It is what some think Plato to have meant by an 
'idea.'
