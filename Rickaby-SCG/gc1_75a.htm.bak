Taken by itself, this chapter might seem to
argue that God wills the existence of all things that
He understands as possible, and that He necessarily
wills the existence of things outside Himself, and so
necessarily creates them.  These conclusions are
rejected in Chap. <a href="gc1_81.htm">LXXXI</a>. 
Though God understands all things 
possible, He does not will them all. If He
willed them all, they would all be, which is absurd.
It is impossible for all things severally possible ever
to come to be conjunctively realised in actuality.
