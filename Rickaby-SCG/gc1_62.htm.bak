<H1>That the Truth of God is the First and Sovereign Truth</h1>

THE standard in every genus is the most perfect instance of the 
genus. But the divine truth is the standard of all truth. The 
truth of our mind is measured by the object outside the mind: our 
understanding is called true, inasmuch as it is in accordance 
with that object. And again the truth of the object is measured 
by its accordance with the divine mind, which is the cause of all 
things (B. II, Chap. XXIV), as the truth of artificial objects is 
measured by the art of the artificer. Since then God is the first 
understanding and the first object of understanding, the truth of 
every understanding must be measured by His truth, as everything 
is measured by the first and best of its kind.
