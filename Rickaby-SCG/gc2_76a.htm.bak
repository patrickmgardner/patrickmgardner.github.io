The reason being that Alexander did not recognise the potential 
intellect for a spiritual faculty at all; while to Avicenna it was like 
the 'fit boy' in Pickwick, always dropping off to sleep, remembering 
nothing, and needing continual excitation from without to make it 
understand. See notes pp. <A HREF="gc2_59a.htm">122</a>, <A

be remembered that Averroes also makes the active intellect one and the 
same for all men.
