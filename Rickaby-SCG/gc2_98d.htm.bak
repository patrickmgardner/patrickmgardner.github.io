"We cannot suppose that such an intelligence is denuded of such 
presentations," because such supposition would involve that 
intelligence in total darkness as to the facts of its environment, 
which darkness would be a stultifying of the whole nature of 
intelligence. The only question can be, how the angelic intelligence 
becomes possessed of these presentations. As we shall see in Chap. C, 
St Thomas takes them to be innate ideas.
