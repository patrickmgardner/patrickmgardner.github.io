<H1>That God has a Will</h1>

FROM the fact that God has understanding, it follows that He has a 
will. Since good apprehended in understanding is the proper object of 
the will, understood good, as such, must be willed good. But anything 
understood involves an understanding mind.  A mind then that 
understands good, must, as such, be a mind that wills good.<P>

3. What is consequent upon all being, is a property of being, as such. 
Such a property must be found in its perfection in the first and 
greatest of beings.  Now it is a property of all being to seek its own 
perfection and the preservation of its own existence. Every being does 
this in its own way: intelligent beings, by their will: animals, by 
their sensitive appetite: unconscious nature, by a certain physical 
<i>nisus</i>.<A HREF="gc1_72a.htm">*</a> It makes a difference however 
whether the thing craved for is possessed or not. Where it is not 
possessed, the <i>nisus</i> of desire proper to each several kind goes 
out to seek what is wanting: where the thing is possessed, it is rested 
in and clung to.  This characteristic of all being cannot be wanting in 
the first of beings, which is God. Since then God has understanding, He 
has also a will, whereby He takes complacency in His own being and His 
own goodness.<P> 

4. The more perfect the act of understanding is, the more delightful to 
the understanding mind. But God has understanding and a most perfect 
act thereof (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_44.htm">XLIV</a>): therefore that act 
yields Him the utmost delight. But as sensible delight is through the 
concupiscible appetite, so is intellectual delight through the will. God 
then has a will. This will of God the testimonies of Holy Scripture 
confess: <i>All things whatsoever he hath willed, the Lord hath 
done</i> (Ps. cxxxiv, 6): <i>Who resisteth his will?</i> (Rom. ix, 19).
