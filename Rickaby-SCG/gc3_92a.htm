'Fortunate,' <i>bene fortunatus</i>, a literal rendering of 
<b>eutuch&ecirc;s</b>. The 'higher causes' here contemplated are the 
causes which exist above this sublunary world, namely, the heavenly 
bodies, the angels, and God.  For the 'heavenly bodies' we may 
henceforth substitute the 'forces of physical nature,' the working of 
which was attributed in St Thomas' day mainly to the action of the 
stars and spheres.
