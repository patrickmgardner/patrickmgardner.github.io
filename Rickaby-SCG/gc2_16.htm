<H1>That God has brought things into being out of nothing</h1>

To every effect produced by God there is either something pre-existent 
or not. If not, the thesis stands, that God produces some effect out of 
nothing pre-existent. If anything pre-exists, we either have a process 
to infinity, which is impossible, or we must come to something 
primitive, which does not presuppose anything else previous to it. Now 
this primitive something cannot be God Himself, for God is not the 
material out of which anything is made (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_16.htm">XVI</a>): nor can it be any other being, distinct 
from God and uncaused by God (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_15.htm">XV</a>).<p> 

3. The more universal the effect, the higher the cause: for the higher 
the cause, the wider its range of efficiency. Now being is more 
universal than motion. Therefore above any cause that acts only by 
moving and transmitting must be that cause which is the first principle 
of being; and that we have shown to be God (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_13.htm">XIII</a>). God therefore does not act merely by 
moving and transmuting: whereas every cause that can only bring things 
into being out of pre-existing material acts merely in that way, for a 
thing is made out of material by movement or some change.<p> 

4. It is not proper to the universal cause of being, as such, to act 
only by movement and change: for not by movement and change is being, 
as such, made out of not-being, as such, but 'being this' is made out 
of 'not being this.' But God is the universal principle of being (Chap. 
<A HREF="gc2_15.htm">XV</a>). Therefore it is not proper to Him to act 
only by movement or change, or to need pre-existent material to make 
anything.<p> 

5. Every agent has a term of action like itself, for its acts inasmuch 
as it is in actuality. Given then an agent in actuality by some form 
inherent in it, and not to the whole extent of its substance,<A 
HREF="gc2_16a.htm">*</a> it will be proper to such an agent to produce 
its effect by causing a form in some way inherent in matter. But God is 
in actuality, not by anything inhering in Him, but to the whole extent 
of His substance (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_18.htm">XVIII</a>). 
Therefore the proper mode of divine action is to produce the whole 
subsistent thing, and not a mere inherent thing, as is form in 
matter.<p> 

10. Between actuality and potentiality such an order obtains, that, 
though in one and the same being, which is sometimes in potentiality 
sometimes in actuality, potentiality is prior in time to actuality 
(although actuality is prior in nature), yet, absolutely speaking, 
actuality must be prior to potentiality, as is clear from this, that 
potentiality is not reduced to actuality except by some actual being. 
But matter is being in potentiality.<A HREF="gc2_16b.htm">*</a> 
Therefore God, first and pure actuality, must be absolutely prior to 
matter, and consequently cause thereof.<p> 

This truth divine Scripture confirms, saying: <i>In the beginning God 
created heaven and earth</i> (Gen. i,1). For to create is nothing else 
than to bring a thing into being without any pre-existent material.<p> 

Hereby is confuted the error of the ancient philosophers, who supposed 
no cause at all for matter, since in the actions of particular agents 
they always saw some matter pre-existent to every action. Hence they 
took up the common opinion, that nothing is made out of nothing, which 
indeed is true of the actions of particular agents. But they had not 
yet arrived at a knowledge of the universal agent, the active cause of 
all being, whose causative action does not necessarily suppose any 
pre-existent material.<A HREF="gc2_16c.htm">*</a><p>
