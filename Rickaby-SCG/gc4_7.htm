<H1>Rejection of Arius's Position</h1>

HOLY Scripture calls Christ 'Son of God' and the angels 'sons of God,' 
yet not in the same sense. To which of the angels did he ever say: 
<i>Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?</i> (Heb. i, 5).<p> 

2. If Christ were called 'Son' in the same sense as all the angels and 
saints, He would not be <i>Only-begotten</i>, however much, for the 
excellence of His nature above the rest, He might be called 
<i>first-born</i> (Ps. lxxxviii, 27). But the Scripture declares Him to 
be the <i>Only-begotten</i> (John i, 14).<p>

5. <i>Of whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all things, 
God blessed for ever</i> (Rom. ix, 5):<A HREF="gc4_7a.htm">*</a> 
<i>Expecting the sacred hope and coming of the glory of the great God and 
our Saviour Jesus Christ</i> (Tit. ii. 13): <i>I will raise up to David a 
just branch, and this is what they shall call him, the Lord our just 
one</i> (Jerem. xxiii, 5, 6), where in the Hebrew we find the 
tetragrammaton, the name of God alone.<A HREF="gc4_7b.htm">*</a><p> 

7. No creature receives the whole fulness of the divine goodness: but 
in Christ there <i>dwells all the fulness of the Godhead</i> (Col. ii, 
9).<p> 

8. An angel's mind falls far short of the divine mind: but the mind of 
Christ in point of knowledge does not fall short of the divine mind: 
for in Him <i>are hidden all treasures of wisdom and knowledge</i> 
(Col. ii, 3).<p> 

9. <i>All things whatsoever that the Father hath are mine; All mine are 
thine, and thine are mine</i> (John xvi, 15: xvii, 10). [Cf. Luke xv, 
31.] Therefore there is the same essence and nature of the Father and 
the Son.<p> 

10. In Phil. ii, 7, 8, by <i>the form of God</i> is understood no other 
than the <i>nature of God</i>, as by <i>the form of a servant</i> is 
understood no other than human nature.<p> 

11. <i>The Jews sought to kill him because he said that God was his 
Father, making himself equal to God</i> (John v, 18). This is the 
narrative of the evangelist, <i>whose testimony is true</i> (John xix, 
35): nor is it doubtful to any Christian but that what Christ said of 
Himself is true.<p> 

13. No created substance represents God in His substance: for whatever 
appears of the perfection of any creature is less than what God is: 
hence through no creature can the essence of God be known. But the Son 
represents the Father; for the Apostle says of Him that He is <i>the 
image of the invisible God</i> (Col. i, 15). And lest He should be 
accounted an image falling short of and failing to represent the 
essence of God; or an image whence the essence of God could not be 
known, even as man is said to be <i>the image of God</i> (1 Cor xi, 7), 
He is declared to be a perfect image, representing the very substance 
of God, <i>the splendour of his glory, and figure of his substance</i> 
(Heb. i, 3).<p> 

19. Our final happiness is in God alone; and to Him alone the honour of 
<i>latria</i> is to be paid (B. III, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_120.htm">CXX</a>). But our happiness is in God the Son: 
<i>This is life everlasting, that they know thee, and him whom thou 
hast sent, Jesus Christ</i> (John xvii, 3). And it is said: <i>That all 
may honour the Son, as they honour the Father</i> (John v, 23); and 
again, <i>Adore him, all ye angels</i> (Ps. xcvi, 8), which the Apostle 
(Heb. i, 6) quotes as applying to the Son.<p> 

Taught by these and similar evidences of Holy Scripture, the Catholic 
Church confesses Christ to be the true and natural Son of God, 
co-eternal and equal with the Father; true God, of the same essence and 
nature with the Father; begotten, not created, nor made. Hence it 
appears that the faith of the Catholic Church alone truly confesses 
generation in God, referring the generation of the Son to the fact of 
His receiving the divine nature of the Father. Other teachers 
heretically refer this generation to a nature extraneous to Godhead, --
Photinus and Sabellius to a human nature; Arius not to a human indeed, 
but still to a created nature, more honorable than other creatures. 
Arius further differs from Sabellius and Photinus in asserting that 
this generation was before the creation of the world, while they say 
that it was not before the Virgin birth. Sabellius however differs from 
Photinus in this, that Sabellius confesses Christ to be true God by 
nature, which neither Photinus nor Arius confesses; but Photinus says 
that He was a mere man, Arius that He was a sort of compound 
super-excellent creature, at once divine and human. Photinus and Arius 
confess that the person of the Father and of the Son is different, 
which Sabellius denies. The Catholic faith therefore, taking the middle 
course (<i>media via incedens</i>) confesses, with Arius and Photinus 
against Sabellius, that the person of the Father and of the Son is 
different, the Son being begotten, the Father absolutely unbegotten; 
but with Sabellius against Photinus and Arius, that Christ is true God 
by nature, and of the same nature with the Father, -- albeit not of the 
same person. Hence we gather some inkling of the truth of the Catholic 
position: for to the truth, as the Philosopher says,<A 
HREF="gc4_7c.htm">*</a> even false opinions testify; whereas false 
opinions are at variance, not only with the truth, but with one 
another.
