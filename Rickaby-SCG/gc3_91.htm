<H1>How Human Things are reduced to Higher Causes<A HREF="gc3_91a.htm">*</a></h1>

FROM what has been shown above we are able to gather how human
things are reducible to higher causes, and do not proceed by chance.
For choices and motives of wills are arranged immediately by God:
human intellectual knowledge is directed by God through the intermediate
agency of angels: corporeal events, whether interior (to the human body) or
exterior, that serve the need of man, are adjusted by God through the 
intermediate agency of angels and of the heavenly bodies.<p>

All this arrangement proceeds upon one general axiom, which is this: 
'Everything manifold and mutable and liable to fail may be reduced to 
some principle uniform and immutable and unfailing.'<A 
HREF="gc3_91b.htm">*</a> But everything about our selves proves to be 
manifold, variable, and defectible. Our choices are evidently manifold, 
since different things are chosen by different persons in different 
circumstances. They are likewise mutable, as well on account of the 
fickleness of our mind, which is not confirmed in its last end, as also 
on account of changes of circumstance and environment. That they are 
defectible, the sins of men clearly witness. On the other hand, the 
will of God is uniform, because in willing one thing He wills all other 
things: it is also immutable and indefectible (B. I, Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc1_23.htm">XXIII</a>, <A HREF="gc1_75.htm">LXXV</a>). Therefore 
all motions of volition and choice must be reduced to the divine will, 
and not to any other cause, because God alone is the cause of our 
volitions and elections.<p> 

In like manner our intelligence is liable to multiplicity, inasmuch as 
we gather intelligible truth from many sensible objects. It is also 
mutable, inasmuch as it proceeds by reasoning from one point to 
another, passing from known to unknown. It is also defectible from the 
admixture of phantasy and sense, as the errors of mankind show. But 
the cognitions of the angels are uniform, as they receive the knowledge 
of truth from the one fountain of truth, God (B. II, Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc2_98.htm">XCVIII</a>, <A HREF="gc2_100.htm">C</a>, 
with notes). It is also immutable, because not by any argument from 
effects to causes, nor from causes to effects, but by simple 
intuition do they gaze upon the pure truth of things. It is also 
indefectible, since they discern the very natures of things, or their 
quiddities in themselves, about which quiddities intelligence cannot 
err, as neither can sense err about the primary objects of the several 
senses. But we learn the quiddities (essences) of things from their 
accidents and effects. Our intellectual knowledge then must be 
regulated by the knowledge of the angels.<A HREF="gc3_91c.htm">*</a><p> 

Again, about human bodies and the exterior things which men use, it is 
manifest that there is in them the multiplicity of mixture and 
contrariety; and that they do not always move in the same way, because 
their motions cannot be continuous; and that they are defectible by 
alteration and corruption. But the heavenly bodies are uniform, as 
being simple and made up without any contrariety of elements. Their 
motions also are uniform, continuous, and always executed in the same 
way: nor can there be in them corruption or alteration. Hence our 
bodies, and other things that come under our use, must necessarily be 
regulated by the motion of the heavenly bodies.<A HREF="gc3_91d.htm">*</a>
