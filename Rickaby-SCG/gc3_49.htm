<H1>That the Knowledge which Pure Spirits have of God through knowing their 
own Essence does not carry with it a Vision of the Essence of God</h1>

WE must further enquire whether this very knowledge, whereby separately 
subsistent intelligences and souls after death know God through knowing 
their own essences, suffices for their own happiness. For the 
investigation of this truth we must first show that the divine essence 
is not known by any such mode of knowledge. In no way can the essence 
of a cause be known in its effect, unless the effect be the adequate 
expression of the whole power of the cause.<A HREF="gc3_49a.htm">*</a> 
But pure spirits know God through their own substances, as a cause is 
known through its effect inasmuch as each sees God as mirrored in 
another, and each sees God as expressed in himself.<A 
HREF="gc3_49b.htm">*</a> But none of these pure spirits is an effect 
adequate to the power of God (B. II, Chapp. XXVI, XXVII). It is 
impossible therefore for them to see the divine essence by this method 
of knowledge.<p> 

2. An intelligible likeness, whereby a thing is understood in its 
substance must be of the same species as that thing, or rather it must 
be its species, -- thus the form of a house in the architect's mind is 
the same species as the form of the house which is in matter, or rather 
it is its species, -- for by the species of man you do not understand 
the essence of <i>ass</i> or <i>horse</i>.<A HREF="gc3_49c.htm">*</a> 
But the nature of an angel is not the same as the divine nature in 
species, nay not even in genus (B. I, Chap. XXV).<p> 

3. Everything created is bounded within the limits of some genus or 
species. But the divine essence is infinite, comprising within itself 
every perfection of entire being (B. I, Chapp. XXVIII, XLIII). It is 
impossible therefore for the divine substance to be seen through any 
created medium.<p> 

Nevertheless a pure spirit by knowing its own substance knows the 
existence of God, and that God is the cause of all, and eminent above 
all, and removed (<i>remotus</i>) from all, not only from all things 
that are, but from all that the created mind can conceive. To this 
knowledge of God we also may attain in some sort: for from the effects 
of His creation we know of God that He is, and that He is the cause 
(sustaining principle) of other beings, super-eminent above other 
beings, and removed from all. And this is the highest perfection of our 
knowledge in this life: hence Dionysius says (<i>De mystica 
theologia</i> c. 2) that "we are united with God as with the unknown"; 
which comes about in this way, that we know of God what He is not, but 
what He is remains absolutely unknown. And to show the ignorance of 
this most sublime knowledge it is said of Moses that <i>he drew nigh to 
the darkness in which God was</i> (Exod. xx, 21).<A 
HREF="gc3_49d.htm">*</a><p> 

But because an inferior nature at its height attains only to the lowest 
grade of the nature superior to it, this knowledge must be more 
excellent in pure spirits than in us. For (a) the nearer and more 
express the effect, the more evidently apparent the existence of the 
cause. But pure spirits, that know God through themselves, are nearer 
and more express likenesses of God than the effects through which we 
know God.<p> 

(c) High dignity better appears, when we know to what other high 
dignities it stands preferred. Thus a clown, knowing the king to be the 
chief man in the kingdom, but for the rest knowing only some of the 
lowest officials of the kingdom, with whom he has to do, does not know 
the king's pre-eminence so well as another, who knows the dignity of 
all the princes of the realm. But we men know only some of the lowest 
of things that are. Though then we know that God is high above all 
beings, still we do not know the height of the Divine Majesty as the 
angels know it, who know the highest order of beings and God's 
elevation above them all.
