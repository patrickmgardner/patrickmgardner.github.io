The 'cogitative faculty' (Chap. LX) is the <b>to dianoeisthai</b> of 
<i>De anima</i>, I, iv, 14, where it is expressly said not to be a 
<b>pathos</b> of <b>to noein</b>. The inferiority of 
<b>dianoeisthai</b> to <b>noein</b> in Aristotle was probably suggested 
by, though it is not identical with, that of <b>dianoia</b> to 
<b>nous</b> in Plato, <i>Rep.</i> vi, <i>ad fin</i>.
