The celebrated saying about the mas accidentatus
occurs in Aristotle, <i>De gen. animal.</i> B. II, iii, 18, <b>to 
gar the&circ;lu h&ocirc;sper arren esti pep&ecirc;r&ocirc;menon</b>.
St Thomas seems to have had it in mind here to repudiate it.
Whatever is 'intended by nature' is <i>per se</i> and not
<i>per accidens</i>.
