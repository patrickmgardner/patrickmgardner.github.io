'No cause,' when you consider the case in the
abstract, but how if it be taken in the concrete, 
a man going to look for water in a region infested
with robbers?<p>

In speaking of a 'necessary cause' St Thomas is
in fact thinking of a physical cause which is not
likely to be counteracted, or to have any of its requisite 
conditions fail, e.g., the rotation of the earth 
producing sun-rise. In speaking of a  contingent cause,
-- so far as the phrase may be used without bringing
free will into the field, -- he has in view a physical
cause, the action of which may readily be counteracted 
by the interference of other physical causes, or
may fail of effect because some one of its many requisite 
conditions is not present. A contingent physical
cause, uninterfered with and having all its conditions
present, works as a necessary cause.
