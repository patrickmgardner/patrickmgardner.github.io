<H1>The Opinion of Photinus touching the Son of God, and its 
Rejection<A HREF="gc4_4a.htm">*</a></h1>

IT is customary in Scripture for those who are justified by divine 
grace to be called <i>sons of God</i>, -- John i, 12: Rom. viii, 1: i 
John iii, 1: and <i>begotten of God</i>, James i, 1: i John iii, 9; 
and, what is more wonderful, even the name of Godhead is ascribed to 
them, Exod. vii, 1: Ps. lxxxi, 6: John x, 35. Going upon this usage, 
some wrong-headed men took up the opinion that Jesus Christ was a mere 
man, that His existence began with His birth of the Virgin Mary, that 
He gained divine honours above the rest of men through the merit of His 
blessed life, that like other men He was the Son of God by the Spirit 
of adoption, and by grace was born of God, and by a certain 
assimilation to God is called in the Scriptures God, not by nature, but 
by some participation in the divine goodness, as is also said of the 
saints, 2 Pet. i, 4. And this position they endeavoured to confirm by 
authority of Holy Scripture: <i>All power is given to me in heaven and on 
earth</i> (Matt. xxviii, 18): but, say they, if He were God before all 
time, He would not have received power in time. Also it is said of the 
Son that He was <i>made of the seed of David according to the flesh, 
and predestinated the Son of God in power</i> (Rom. i, 3, 4): but what is made 
and predestinated is not eternal. Again the text, <i>He was made obedient 
unto death, even the death of the cross: wherefore hath God exalted 
him, and given him the name that is above every name</i> (Phil. ii, 8, 9), 
seems to show that by merit of His obedience and suffering He was 
granted divine honours and raised above all. Peter too says: <i>Let all 
the House of Israel most certainly know that this Jesus, whom ye have 
crucified, God hath made Lord and Christ</i> (Acts ii, 36). He seems then 
to have become God in time, not to have been born so before all ages. 
They also allege in support of their opinion those texts of Scripture 
which seem to point to defect in Christ, as that He was carried in 
woman's womb (Luke i, 42: ii, 5), that He grew in age (Luke ii, 52), 
that He suffered hunger (Luke iv, 2) and fatigue (John iv, 6), and 
was subject to death, that he continually advanced (Luke ii, 40, 52), 
that He confessed He did not know the day of judgement (Mark xiii, 32), 
that He was stricken with fear of death (Luke xxii, 42, 44), and other 
weaknesses inadmissible in one who was God by nature.<p>

But careful study of the words of Holy Scripture shows that there is 
not that meaning in them which these Photinians have supposed. For when 
Solomon says: <i>The abysses as yet were not, and I (Wisdom) was 
already conceived</i> (Prov. viii, 24), he sufficiently shows that this 
generation took place before all corporeal things. And though an 
endeavour has been to wrest away these and other testimonies by saying 
that they are to be understood of predestination, in the sense that 
before the creation of the world it was arranged that the Son of God 
should be born of the Virgin Mary, not that her Son existed before the 
world; nevertheless the words which follow show that He was before Mary 
not only in predestination, but really. For it follows: <i>When he 
weighed the foundations of the earth, I was with him arranging all 
things</i>: but if He had existed in predestination only, He could have 
done nothing. This conclusion may be drawn also from the Evangelist 
John: for, that none might take as referring to predestination the 
words, <i>In the beginning was the Word,</i> he adds: <i>All things 
were made by him, and without him was made nothing</i>: which could not 
be true, had He not real existence before the world was. Likewise from 
the texts John iii, 13: vi, 38, it appears that He had real existence 
ere He descended from heaven. Besides, whereas according to the 
above-mentioned position, a man by the merit of His life was advanced 
to be God, the Apostle contrariwise declares that, being God, He was 
made man: <i>Being in the form of God, he thought it no robbery</i>, 
etc. (Phil. ii, 6.)<p> 

Again, among the rest who had the grace of God, Moses had it 
abundantly, of whom it is said: <i>The Lord spoke to Moses face to 
face, as a man is wont to speak to his friend</i> (Exod. xxxiii, 11). 
If then Jesus Christ were only called 'Son of God' by reason of the 
grace of adoption, as is the, case with other Saints, Moses might be 
called 'Son of God' on the same title as Christ, allowing all the while 
that Christ was endowed with more abundant grace: for among the rest of 
the saints one is filled with greater grace than another, and still 
they are all called 'Sons of God.' But Moses is not called 'Son' on the 
same title as Christ: for the Apostle distinguishes Christ from Moses 
as the son from the servant: <i>Moses indeed was faithful in his house 
as a servant: but Christ as the Son in his own house</i> (Heb. iii, 5).<p> 

The like argument may be gathered from many other places of Scripture, 
where Christ is styled 'Son of God' in a singular manner above others, 
as at His baptism, <i>This is my beloved Son</i> (Matt. iii, 17); or 
where He is called 'the Only-begotten,' -- <i>The Only-begotten Son, 
who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared</i> (John i, 18): 
for were He Son in a general way, as others are, He could not be called 
'Only-begotten': sometimes too He is designated as 'First-born,' to 
show that there is a derivation of sonship from Him to others: <i>To be 
made conformable to the image of his Son, that he may be the first-born 
among many brethren</i> (Rom. viii, 29): <i>God hath sent his Son, that 
we might receive the adoption of sons</i> (Gal. iv, 4: which texts show 
that He, by the likeness of whose Sonship others are called sons, is 
Son Himself after another way than they.<p> 

Furthermore, in the Holy Scriptures some works are set down as so 
peculiarly proper to God as to be never attributable to any one else, 
e.g., the sanctification of souls and the forgiveness of sins: for it 
is said, <i>I am the Lord who sanctify you</i> (Levit. xx, 8): <i>I am 
he who blot out thy sins for mine own sake</i> (Isai. xliii, 25). Yet 
both these works Scripture attributes to Christ, Heb. ii, 11: xiii, 12. 
He declared of Himself that He had the power of forgiving sins, and 
proved His assertion by a miracle (Matt. ix, 1-8); and the angel 
foretold of Him that He should save his people from their sins (Matt. 
i, 21). Christ therefore as sanctifier and forgiver of sins is not 
called 'God' in the same sense as others are called 'gods,' who are 
sanctified and whose sins are forgiven, but as one having the power and 
nature Godhead.<p> 

As for those testimonies of Scripture whereby the Photinians 
endeavoured to show that Christ is not God by nature, they do not serve 
their purpose: for we confess in Christ the Son of God after the 
Incarnation two natures, a human and a divine: hence there are 
predicated of Him at once attributes proper to God, by reason of His 
divine nature, and attributes seeming to involve some defect, or 
shortcoming, by reason of His human nature.  Thus His saying, <i>All 
power is given to me</i>, does not mean that He then received the power 
as a new thing to Him, but that the power, which, the Son of God had 
enjoyed from all eternity, had now begun to appear in the same Son made 
man, by the victory which He had gained over death by rising again.<A 
HREF="gc4_4b.htm">*</a> Hereby it is also clear that Peter's saying 
(Acts ii, 36) of God having made him [Jesus] Lord and Christ, is to be 
referred to the Son in His human nature, in which He began to have in 
time what in His nature He had from eternity.<A 
HREF="gc4_4c.htm">*</a><p> 

Nor does the Apostle (Rom. i, 3) say absolutely that the Son was 
'made,' but that He <i>was made of the seed of David according to the 
flesh</i> by the assumption of human nature. Hence the following words, 
<i>predestinated Son of God</i>, apply to the Son in His human nature: 
for that union of human nature with the Son of God, which made it 
possible man to be called Son of God, was not due to any human merits, 
but to the grace of God predestinating.<A HREF="gc4_4d.htm">*</a>
