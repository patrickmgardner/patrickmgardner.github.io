<h1>Of Baptism</h1>

THE generation of a living thing is a change from not living to life.<A  
HREF="gc4_59a.htm">*</a> Now a man is deprived of spiritual life by 
original sin; and whatever sins are added thereto go still further to 
withdraw him from life. Baptism therefore, or spiritual generation, was 
needed to serve the purpose of taking away original sin and all actual 
sins. And because the sensible sign of a Sacrament must be suited to 
represent the spiritual effect of the Sacrament,<A 
HREF="gc4_59b.htm">*</a> and the washing away of filth is done by 
water, therefore Baptism is fittingly conferred in water sanctified by 
the word of God. And because what is brought into being by generation 
loses its previous form and the properties consequent upon that form, 
therefore Baptism, as being a spiritual generation, not only takes away 
sins, but also all the liabilities contracted by sins, -- all guilt and 
all debt of punishment: therefore no satisfaction for sins is enjoined 
on the baptised.<p> 

With the acquisition of a new form there goes also the acquisition of 
the activity consequent upon that form; and therefore the baptised 
become immediately capable of spiritual actions, such as the reception 
of the other Sacraments. Also there is due to them a position suited to 
the spiritual life: that position is everlasting happiness: and 
therefore the baptised, if they die fresh from baptism, are immediately 
caught up into bliss: hence it is said that baptism opens the gate of 
heaven.<p> 

One and the same thing can be generated only once: therefore, as 
Baptism is a spiritual generation, one man is to be baptised only 
once. The infection that came through Adam defiles a man only once: 
hence Baptism, which is directed mainly against that infection, ought 
not to be repeated. Also, once a thing is consecrated, so long as it 
lasts, it ought not to be consecrated again, lest the consecration 
should appear to be of no avail: hence Baptism, as it is a 
consecration of the person baptised, ought not to be repeated.
