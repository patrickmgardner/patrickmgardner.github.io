<h1>Confutation of the Arguments which seem to
prove the Unity of the Potential Intellect</h1>

<i>ARG. 1.</i> Apparently, every form that is specifically one and 
numerically multiplied, is individualised by its matter: for things 
specifically one and numerically many agree in form, and are 
distinguished according to matter. If then the potential intellect is 
multiplied according to number in different men, while it remains one 
in species, it must be multiplied in this and that man by matter, -- by 
the matter which is that man's body the form of which it is supposed to 
be. But every form, individualised by matter which it actuates, is a 
material form: for the being of everything must depend on that on which 
its individuation depends: for as general constituents are of the 
essence of the species, so individualising constituents are of the 
essence of this individual. It follows therefore that the potential 
intellect is a material form, and consequently that it does not receive 
any thing, nor do anything, except through a bodily organ: which is 
contrary to the nature of the potential intellect.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i> We confess that the potential intellect is specifically 
one in different men, and many according to number, -- waiving the 
point that the constituents of man are not put into genus and species 
for what they are in themselves, but for what they are as constituents 
of the whole. Still it does not follow that the potential intellect is 
a material form, dependent for its being on the body. For as it is 
specifically proper to the human soul to be united to a certain species 
of body, so any individual soul differs from any other individual soul, 
in number only, inasmuch as it is referable to numerically another 
body. Thus then human souls, -- and consequently the potential 
intellect, which is a faculty of the human soul, -- are individualised 
according to bodies, not that the individuation is caused by the 
bodies.<A HREF="gc2_75a.htm">*</a><p> 

<i>Arg. 2.</i> If the potential intellect were different in this man 
and that, the impression understood would have to be numerically 
different in this man, while remaining one in species: for since the 
proper subject of impressions actually understood is the potential 
intellect, when that intellect is multiplied there must be a 
corresponding multiplication of intellectual impressions according to 
the number of different individuals. But the only impressions or forms 
which are the same in species and different in number, are individual 
forms, which cannot be intellectual forms, because objects of intellect 
are universal, not particular. It is impossible therefore for the 
potential intellect to be multiplied in different individual men.<A 
HREF="gc2_75b.htm">*</a><p> 

<i>Reply.</i> This second argument fails from neglecting to distinguish 
between that <i>whereby (quo)</i> we understand, and that <i>which 
(quod)</i> we understand. The impression received in the potential 
intellect is not to be taken for that <i>which</i> is understood. For 
as all arts and sciences have for their object-matter things 
<i>which</i> are understood, it would follow that the subject-matter of 
all sciences was impressions on the potential intellect: which is 
manifestly false, for no science has anything to say to such mental 
impressions except psychology and metaphysics: though it is true that 
through those mental impressions there is known the whole content of 
all the sciences.<A HREF="gc2_75c.htm">*</a> Therefore, in the process 
of understanding, the intellectual impression received in the potential 
intellect is that <i>whereby</i> we understand, as the impression of 
colour in the eye is not that <i>which</i> is seen, but that 
<i>whereby</i> we see. On the other hand, that <i>which</i> is 
understood is the nature (<i>ratio</i>) of things existing outside the 
soul, as also it is things existing outside the soul that are seen with 
the bodily sight: for to this end were arts and sciences invented, that 
things might be known in their natures (<i>naturis</i>).<p> 

Still it does not follow that, if sciences are of universal truths, 
universals should subsist by themselves outside the soul, as Plato 
supposed. For though for the truth of knowledge it is necessary that 
the knowledge should answer to the thing, still it is not necessary 
that the mode of the knowledge and the mode of the thing should be the 
same: for properties that are united in the thing are sometimes known 
separately. Thus one and the same thing is white and sweet: still sight 
takes cognisance only of the whiteness, and taste only of the 
sweetness. Thus again intellect understands a line drawn in sensible 
matter apart from that sensible matter, though it might understand it 
also along with the sensible matter.<A HREF="gc2_75d.htm">*</a> This 
difference arises according to the diversity of intellectual 
impressions received in the intellect, which some times are the 
likeness of quantity only, sometimes of a sensible quantitative 
substance. In like manner also, though the nature of genus and species 
never exists except in concrete individuals, still the intellect 
understands the nature of genus and species without understanding the 
individualising elements; and this is the meaning of understanding 
universals. And so these two positions are reconciled, that universals 
have no subsistence outside the soul; and yet that the intellect, 
understanding universals, understands things which are outside the 
soul.<p> 

The fact of the intellect understanding the nature of genus and species 
stripped of its individualising elements, arises from the condition of 
the intellectual impression  received in understanding, which 
impression is rendered immaterial<A HREF="gc2_75e.htm">*</a> by the 
active intellect, inasmuch as it is abstracted from matter and 
materialising conditions whereby a thing is individualised. And 
therefore the sentient faculties can take no cognisance of universals, 
since they cannot receive an immaterial form, seeing that they receive 
always in a bodily organ.<p> 

It is not therefore necessary that the intellectual impression of this 
and that intelligence should be numerically one: for it would follow 
thereupon that the act of understanding in them both was also 
numerically one, since activity follows form, which is the principle of 
species: but it is necessary, to the end that one object should be 
understood by both minds, that there should be a like impression of one 
and the same object in them both. And this is possible enough, although 
the intellectual impressions differ in number: for there is no 
difficulty in having different images of one thing; hence the 
contingency of one than being seen by several persons.<A 
HREF="gc2_75f.htm">*</a> There is nothing inconsistent then with the 
universalising knowledge of the understanding in their being different 
intellectual impressions in different minds. Nor need it ensue, because 
these intellectual impressions are many in number and the same in 
species, that they are not actual but only potential terms of 
understanding, as is the case with other individual things. Mere 
individuality is not inconsistent with intelligibility: for we must 
admit the potential and active intellects themselves, if we may suppose 
the two to subsist apart, united to no body, but subsistent by 
themselves, to be individual beings and still intelligible. What is 
inconsistent with intelligibility is materiality: as is shown by this 
consideration, that for the forms of material things to become actually 
intelligible, abstraction has to be made from the particular matter in 
which they are lodged;<A HREF="gc2_75g.htm">*</a> and therefore in 
cases in which individuation is due to particular matter involving 
particular dimensions,<A HREF="gc2_75h.htm">*</a> the things so 
individualised are not actually intelligible. But where individuation 
is not due to matter, such individual things may without difficulty be 
actually intelligible. Now intellectual impressions, like all other 
forms, are individualised by their subject, which is the potential 
intellect; and since the potential intellect is not material, it does 
not stand in the way of the actual intelligibility of the impressions 
individualised by it.<p> 

But though we have said that the intellectual impression, received in 
the potential intellect, is not that which is understood, but that 
whereby we understand, still it remains true that by reflection the 
intellect understands itself and its own intellectual act and the 
impression whereby it understands. Its own intellectual act it 
understands in two ways, -- in one way, in particular, for it 
understands that it is now understanding; in another way, in general, 
inasmuch as it reasons about the said act. And likewise it understands 
intellect and the impression in intellect in two ways, -- by remarking 
that itself is and has an intellectual impression, which is particular 
knowledge; and by studying its own nature and the nature of the 
intellectual impression, which is knowledge of the universal. According 
to this latter way we treat of intellect and of the intelligible in 
science.<p>

<i>Arg. 3.</i> The master transfuses the knowledge which he has into 
the scholar. Either then the knowledge transfused is the same in 
number, or different in number, though the same in species. The latter 
alternative seems impossible: because it supposes the master to cause 
his own knowledge in the scholar in the same way that an agent causes 
its own form in another being, by generating a nature specifically like 
its own; which seems proper to material agents. It must be then that 
numerically the same knowledge is caused in the scholar that was in the 
master; which would be impossible, were there not one potential 
intellect of them both.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> The saying that the knowledge in master and scholar is 
numerically one, is partly true and partly not: it is numerically one 
in point of the thing known, but not in point of the intellectual 
impressions whereby the thing is known, nor in point of the habit of 
knowledge itself. It is to be observed however that, as Aristotle 
(<i>Metaph.</i> VII, ix) teaches, there are arts in whose subject 
matter there is not any principle active in producing the effect of the 
art, as is clear in the building art: for in wood and stones there is 
no active power moving to the erection of a house, but only a passive 
aptitude. But there is an art in whose subject matter there is an 
active principle moving in the direction of the effect of the art, as 
is clear in the healing art: for in the sick subject there is an active 
principle tending to health. And therefore the effect of the former 
kind of art is never produced by nature, but always by art, as every 
house is a work of art:<A HREF="gc2_75i.htm">*</a> but the effect of 
the latter kind is produced as well by art as by nature without art: 
for many are healed by the operation of nature without the art of 
medicine. In these things that can be done both by art and nature, art 
imitates nature: thus if one is sick of a chill, nature heals him by 
warming him: hence the physician also, if he is to cure him, heals him 
by warming. Similar is the case with the art of teaching: for in the 
pupil there is an active principle making for knowledge, namely, the 
understanding, and those primary axioms which are naturally understood; 
and therefore knowledge is acquired in two ways, -- without teaching, 
by a man's own finding out, and again by teaching. The teacher 
therefore begins to teach in the same way that the discoverer begins to 
find out, by offering for the consideration of the scholar elements of 
knowledge already possessed by him: because all education and all 
knowledge starts from pre-existing knowledge, drawing conclusions from 
elements already in the mind, and proposing sensible examples whereby 
there may be formed in the scholar's soul those impressions of phantasy 
which are necessary or intelligence.<A HREF="gc2_75j.htm">*</a> And 
because the working of the teacher from without would effect nothing, 
unless borne out by an internal principle of knowledge, which is within 
us by the gift of God, so it is said among theologians that man teaches 
by rendering the service of ministry, but God by working within: so too 
the physician is called nature's minister in healing.<p> 

A final remark. Since the Commentator makes the passive intellect the 
residence of habits of knowledge (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_60.htm">LX</a>), 
the unity of the potential intellect helps not at all to the numerical 
unity of knowledge in master and scholar: for certainly the passive 
intellect is not the same in different men, since it is an organic 
faculty. Hence, on his own showing, this argument does not serve his 
purpose.<p>
