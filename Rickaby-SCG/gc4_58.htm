<h1>Of the Number of the Sacraments of the New Law</h1>

THE remedies that provide for spiritual life are marked off, one from 
another, according to the pattern of corporal life. Now in respect of 
corporal life we find two classes of subjects. There are some who 
propagate and regulate corporal life in others, and some in whom 
corporal life is propagated and regulated. To this corporal and natural 
life three things are ordinarily necessary, and a fourth thing 
incidentally so. First, a living thing must receive life by generation 
or birth. Secondly, it must attain by augmentation to due quantity and 
strength. The third necessity is of nourishment. These three, 
generation, growth, and nutrition, are ordinary necessities, since 
bodily life cannot go on without them. But because bodily life may 
receive a check by sickness, there comes to be incidentally a fourth 
necessity, the healing of a living thing when it is sick. So in 
spiritual life the first thing is spiritual generation by Baptism: the 
second is spiritual growth leading to perfect strength by the Sacrament 
of Confirmation: the third is spiritual nourishment by the Sacrament 
of the Eucharist: there remains a fourth, which is spiritual healing, 
either of the soul alone by the Sacrament of Penance, or of the soul 
first, and thence derivatively, when it is expedient, of the body also, 
by Extreme Unction. These Sacraments then concern those subjects in 
whom spiritual life is propagated and preserved. Again, the propagators 
and regulators of bodily life are assorted according to a twofold 
division, namely, according to natural origin, which belongs to parents, 
and according to civil government, whereby the peace of human life is 
preserved, and that belongs to kings and princes. So then it is in 
spiritual lite: there are some propagators and conservators of 
spiritual life by means of spiritual ministration only, and to that 
ministration belongs the Sacrament of Order: there are others who 
propagate and preserve at once corporal and spiritual life together, 
and that is done by the Sacrament of Matrimony, whereby man 
and woman come together to raise up issue and educate their children 
to the worship of God.<A HREF="gc4_58a.htm">*</a>
