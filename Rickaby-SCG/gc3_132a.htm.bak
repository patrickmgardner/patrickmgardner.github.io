A reference to William de Saint Amour, the
great opponent of the religious Orders in the 
University of Paris, against whom St Thomas, about the
same time that he penned these chapters, wrote also
his two <i>Opuscula, Against the assailants of the worship of
God and religion, Of the perfection of religious life</i>.  As
long as religious lived apart in monasteries and lonely
places, they encountered no rivalry and their institute
was little questioned. But the Friar Preachers and the
Friar Minors, coming into towns and universities, soon
provoked jealousy and set men's minds questioning
the whole notion of religious life. Saint Amour's invective 
against the Friars was entitled, <i>Perils of the latter
days</i>. Vigilantius was a contemporary of St Jerome,
who one night in the year 406 sat up and finished
a <i>Liber contra Vigilantium</i> at a sitting.
