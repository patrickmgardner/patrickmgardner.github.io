In the little society of Christ and His disciples everything centred in 
the person of the Master. The smiting of the shepherd was the 
scattering of the flock (Matt. xxvi, 31). It remained, <i>one fold</i>, 
or <i>one flock</i>, so long as it had in Him <i>one Shepherd</i> (John 
x, 16). Then we ask whether so essential a feature of the infant 
Church ought not somehow to reappear and be conspicuous in the Church 
grown great and filling the world.
