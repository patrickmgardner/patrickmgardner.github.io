Of God and His Creatures</a><hr><p> St Thomas is thinking of the case of 
an adult coming to baptism without any intention of leading a good 
life. The conditions of the baptism of John (Luke iii, 10-14) hold 
likewise of Christ's baptism: so St Peter, <b>metano&ecirc;sate kai 
baptisth&ecirc;t&ocirc; hekastos</b> (Acts ii, 38). But these 
are preliminaries, not parts of baptism; whereas the contrition and 
confession of the penitent are as true sacramental parts of the 
Sacrament of Penance as the absolution of the priest.
