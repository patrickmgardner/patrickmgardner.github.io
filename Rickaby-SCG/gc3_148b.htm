And dogs and horses, parrots and monkeys,
learn tricks by contact with man, which they never
would have learnt in their wild state. And savages are
civilised by coming in contact with a culture higher
than their own, but for which contact with a higher
race they would have remained perennial savages. As
man humanises the brute, and civilises his savage
brother, so does God divinise man.
