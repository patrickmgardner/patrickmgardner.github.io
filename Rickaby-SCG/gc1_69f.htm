The reference is to Aristotle, <i>Physics</i> III, 6.          
The whole chapter is worth reading, but these words
in particular: "The infinite, as such, is unknowable.
. . . . We must not take the infinite to be any one
definite reality, as a man, or a house, but in the sense
in which we speak of 'the day' and 'the performance,'
entities of which is predicated no substantial reality,
but a reality that consists in perpetually coming to be
and ceasing to be; a reality which, though limited, is
continually other and other. For the infinite
is not that, beyond which is nothing, but beyond
which there is always something." Aristotle then does
not admit the possibility of the <i>actual</i> infinite, full and
complete, but only of the series running on without
stopping, and never reaching a final term, which is
called <i>potential</i> infinity.
