'Unlike Averroes, who places it in a separate potential intellect,' was 
the thought in St Thomas' mind. The quotation referred to is 
<i>Soliloq.</i> II, xix, 33 "This is a convincing proof that truth is 
also in our mind. . . . Therefore the soul is immortal. Do at last 
believe your own reasons, believe the voice of truth: she cries out 
that she dwells in you and is immortal."
