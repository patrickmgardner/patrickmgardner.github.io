In the phrase which he constantly repeats, <i>decisio seminis</i>, St 
Thomas interprets <i>decisio</i> as any scholar would interpret it, to 
be a derivative of <i>decido (I cut off)</i>. Still, I suspect, 
whoever first used the phrase meant <i>decisio</i> to come from 
<i>decido (I fall down)</i>, which would yield a more natural sense. 
To <i>decisio</i>, as meaning a 'cutting off,' is due to the false 
analogy of the divided earthworm.
