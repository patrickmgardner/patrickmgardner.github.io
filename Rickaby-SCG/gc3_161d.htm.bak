Akin to this is the problem of the 'cauterised
conscience,' discussed by St Alphonsus Liguori in the
opening of his Moral Theology, -- the imputability
of sin to one who has become so habituated to it as
to commit sin as a matter of course on every occasion, 
without giving it a second thought, with no
hesitation and no remorse.
