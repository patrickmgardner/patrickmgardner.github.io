But not so entirely beyond the capacity of telescopes, spectroscopes 
and photographic plates. -- Can we then say that the difference between 
a created intelligence and the divine is more like a difference of 
degree than of kind? Can we say that created and divine differ only as 
finite and infinite in the same kind? We cannot say that: for God is 
not in any kind (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_25.htm">XXV</a>), and the 
same name is predicable of God and His creature only in an analogous 
sense (B. I, Chapp. <A HREF="gc1_32.htm">XXXII</a>, <A 
HREF="gc1_34.htm">XXXIV</a>). The difference between Creator and 
creature is not a difference of degree, and is deeper than any 
difference of kind. I do not venture to dissent from St Thomas's 
solution, and I have no other. But to me the difficulty remains, still 
outstanding, and apparently insoluble.
