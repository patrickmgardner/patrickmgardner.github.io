This error represents an extreme form of Nominalism. 
These two opposite erroneous tendencies
must often strike the careful reader of philosophy
and theology. Catholic thinkers, abhorring the Charybdis 
of the latter error, sometimes run perilously
near to the Scylla of the former. I mean, they are
apt to refer too much to the arbitrary will of God,
and too little to the 'nature of things.'
