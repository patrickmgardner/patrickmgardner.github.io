I translate this chapter, every word, as a specimen
of the thought of the thirteenth century, also as a specimen
of the need in which St Thomas's work often
stands of restoration and reconstruction at the hands
of some modern Aquinas. It will not do simply to
pile up quotations from the Angelic Doctor, adding
nothing and altering nothing. St Thomas himself did
not go to work in that way upon his predecessors.
