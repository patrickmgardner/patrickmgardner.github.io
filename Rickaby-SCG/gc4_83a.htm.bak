A flesh that thus has  <i>put on incorruption</i>, a body that
is no longer an <i>animal body</i> (i Cor. xv, 44, 53), will
not waste. The animal life of man will be over: there
will be no more nutrition, or reproduction, or (so at
least it would appear) respiration, or circulation of
the blood, or beating of the heart. The flesh, it would
appear, will be absolutely worked, or energised, by
the spirit, the body by the soul. <i>Quis sapiens et 
intelliget haec?</i>
