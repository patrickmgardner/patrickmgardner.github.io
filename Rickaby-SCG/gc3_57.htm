<H1>That every Intelligence of every grade can be partaker of the vision 
of God</h1>

SINCE it is by supernatural light that a created intelligence is raised 
to the vision of the divine substance, there is no created intelligence 
so low in its nature as to be incapable of being raised to this vision. 
For that light cannot be connatural to any creature (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_54.htm">LIV</a>), but transcends the faculty of every created 
nature. But what is done by supernatural power is not hindered by 
diversity of nature, since divine power is infinite.<A 
HREF="gc3_57a.htm">*</a> Hence in the miraculous healing of the sick it 
makes no difference whether one be very ill or slightly indisposed. 
Therefore diversity of grade in intelligent nature is no hindrance to 
the lowest subject of such a nature being raised by that light to that 
vision.<p> 

2. The distance from God of the intelligence highest in order of nature 
is infinite in respect of perfection and goodness: whereas the distance 
of that intelligence from the very lowest intelligence is finite, for 
between finite and finite there cannot be infinite distance. The 
distance therefore between the lowest created intelligence and the 
highest is as nothing in comparison with the distance between the 
highest created intelligence and God. But what is as nothing can make 
no sensible variation, as the distance between the centre of the earth 
and our point of vision is as nothing in comparison with the distance 
between our point of vision and the eighth sphere, compared with which 
the whole earth counts as a point;<A HREF="gc3_57b.htm">*</a> and 
therefore no sensible error follows from our astronomers in their 
calculations taking their point of observation for the centre of the 
earth.<A HREF="gc3_57c.htm">*</a> Whatever intellect then is raised to 
the vision of God by the above mentioned light, -- be it highest, or 
lowest, or middlemost, -- it makes no difference.<p> 

3. Every intelligence naturally desires the vision of the divine 
substance (Chapp. <A HREF="gc3_25.htm">XXV</a>, <A 
HREF="gc3_50.htm">L</a> ). But a natural desire cannot be in vain. Any 
and every created intelligence then can arrive at the vision of the 
divine substance; and inferiority of nature is no impediment.<p> 

Hence the Lord promises to man the glory of the angels: <i>They shall 
be as the angels of God in Heaven</i> (Matt. xxii, 30); and in the 
Apocalypse the same measure is said to be of man and angel: <i>the 
measure of a man, that is, of an angel</i> (Apoc. xxi, 17). Therefore 
often in Holy Scripture the angels are described in the form of men, 
either entirely so, as with the angels who appeared to Abraham (Gen. 
xviii), or partially, as with the living creatures of whom it is said 
that <i>the hand of a man was under their wings</i> (Ezech. i, 8).
