St Thomas here has refuted by anticipation the
Lutheran doctrine of imputed justice.  The Lutherans
met his arguments with scornful epithets, <i>Thomisticus
asinus</i>, and the like. Further his arguments may be
pressed upon certain moderns, who see in sanctifying
grace nothing but what they call a 'moral relation.'
St Thomas seems to consider it something physical.
