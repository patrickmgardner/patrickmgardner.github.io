If there is question of supernatural good, -- as
faith, hope, charity, or other virtues practised on
motives of faith, hope, and charity -- man can do not
a single act of such good, still less persevere in it,
without the aid of grace. If there is question of
natural good, -- as justice, fortitude, temperance,
practised on a motive of 'sweet reasonableness,' -- we
must further enquire whether the question is asked
of man historically considered, as a fallen creature;
then we must take St Thomas's answer, <i>Sum. Theol.</i>
1a-2ae, q. 109, art. 8; or of man as the <i>a priori</i>
philosopher views him, merely as man. In the latter
view this fact still seems discernible, that, the acts of
virtue being difficult, and the call for such acts 
continual, man under such a series of trials is likely to
break down at times, if he have no other support
than the mere liberty of his will. Aristotle refers him
to the support of acquired habits of virtue (<i>Eth. Nic.</i>
II-IV), a considerable support indeed, but these
habits are difficult to acquire, and Aristotle seems to
exaggerate the facility which they afford of well
doing, and the security that comes of them against a
fall. So even in his pure natural condition man
seems to be a feeble creature, that cannot be trusted
to walk quite alone, but needs "some aid of divine
providence governing him from without," and disposing 
external circumstances in his favour. The aid
and kind provision of environment, making for
morality, which would have to be looked for from
God by man even in his pure natural condition, has
been termed by some theologians 'natural grace.'
