Shakespeare's genius was a better thing than
Shakespeare's <i>Othello</i>. Ordinarily, the cause is not
permanently exhausted by the effort of causation;
more remains behind than has been put into the
effect. A man is more proud of what he can do than
of what he has done. There would be small satisfaction 
in viewing a work of your mind, or of your
hands, if you felt that your hand had lost its 
cunning, and your mind was now effete.
