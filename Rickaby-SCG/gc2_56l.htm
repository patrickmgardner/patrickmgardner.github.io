This doctrine is maintained by Father B&ouml;dder, <i>Psychologia 
Rationalis</i>, pp. 356-362, ed. 2, who mentions other Catholics as 
opposing it. Their grounds may be something as follows: -- The doctrine 
was formulated in an age when cell-life, protoplasm, blood corpuscles, 
microbes, were undreamt of. If there is any value in the well-worn 
analogy between the constitution of man and that of a State, the State, 
it may be observed, contains many minor associations, which it does not 
absorb or transform into things political, but is content merely to 
co-ordinate, guard, and set bounds to. We now recognise both molar and 
molecular mechanics: is there not also such a thing as molecular life, 
with principles or 'forms' of its own, besides the molar life of the 
mass of the body as such? Otherwise how could there ever be such a 
thing as a fever or a morbid growth in the body? Are not these abnormal 
developments exaggerations, we might almost say 'rebellions,' of 
secondary lives with which in its ordinary state the body is replete, 
-- secondary lives which in health work in harmony with the main life, 
of which the soul is the principle?
