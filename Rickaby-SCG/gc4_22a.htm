<i>Liber, qui sui causa est</i>. That <i>causa</i> is meant by St 
Thomas for the nominative case, is clear from the context here, as also 
from B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_88.htm">LXXXVIII</a> (<i>ad fin</i> in 
the Latin); also B. II, Chap. <A HREF="gc2_48.htm">XLVIII</a>, n. 2, 
where the same definition is quoted. But turning to the original, 
Aristotle, <i>Metaph.</i> I, ii, <b>eleutheros anthropos ho hautou 
heneka kai m&ecirc; allou &ocirc;n</b> (he is a free man, who is for 
his own sake, and not for the sake of another), we find <i>sui 
caus&acirc;</i>, <b>hautou heneka</b>, 'for his own sake.'
