<H1>That Vegetative, Sentient, and Intelligent are not in man Three 
Souls</h1> 

PLATO lays it down that not one and the same soul is in us at once  
intelligent, sentient, and vegetative.<A HREF="gc2_58a.htm">*</a> In 
this view, granted that the  sentient soul is the form of the body, it 
does not follow that any subsistent intelligence can be the form of a 
body. The untenableness of this position is thus to be shown.<p> 

1. Attributes of the same subject representing different forms are 
predicated of one another accidentally: thus 'white' is said to be 
'musical' accidentally, inasmuch as whiteness and music happen both to 
be in Socrates. If then the intelligent, sentient, and vegetative soul 
are different powers or forms in us, then the attributes that we have 
according to these forms will be predicated of one another 
accidentally. But according to the intelligent soul we are called 
'men,' according to the sentient 'animals,' according to the vegetative 
'living.' This then will be an accidental predication, 'man is an 
animal,' or 'an animal is a living creature.' But on the contrary these 
are cases of essential predication: for man, as man, is an animal; and 
an animal, as an animal, is a living creature. Therefore it is from the 
same principle that one is man, animal, and alive.<A 
HREF="gc2_58b.htm">*</a><p>

2. A thing has unity from the same principle whence it has being, for 
unity is consequent upon being. Since then everything has being from 
its form, it will have unity also from its form. If therefore there are 
posited in man several souls, as so many forms, man will not be one 
being but several. Nor will the order of the forms to one another, one 
ensuing upon the other, suffice for the unity of man: for unity in 
point of orderly succession is not absolute unity: such unity of order 
in fact is the loosest of unities.<A HREF="gc2_58c.htm">*</a><p>

4. If man, as Plato held, is not a compound of soul and body, but is a 
soul using a body; either this is understood of the intelligent soul, 
or of the three souls, if there are three, or of two of them. If of 
three, or two, it follows that man is not one, but two, or three: for 
he is three souls, or at least two. But if this is understood of the 
intelligent soul alone, so that the sentient soul is to be taken for 
the form of the body, and the intelligent soul, using the animate and 
sentient body, is to be man, there will still ensue awkward 
consequences, to wit, that man is not an animal, but uses an animal; 
and that man does not feel, but uses a thing that does feel.<p>

5. Of two or three there cannot be made one without anything to unite 
them, unless one of them stands to the other as actuality to 
potentiality: for so of matter and form there is made one without any 
external bond to bind them together. But if in man there are several 
souls, they do not stand to one another as matter and form, but they 
are all supposed to be actualities and principles of action. If then 
they are to be united to make one man, or one animal, there must be 
something to unite them. This cannot be the body, since rather the body 
is made one by the soul: the proof of which fact is that, when the soul 
departs, the body breaks up. It must be some more formal principle that 
makes of those several entities one; and this will be rather the soul 
than those several entities which are united by it. If this again has 
several parts, and is not one in itself, there must further be 
something to unite those parts. As we cannot proceed to infinity, we 
must come to something which is in itself one; and this of all things 
is the soul.<A HREF="gc2_58d.htm">*</a> There must therefore in one 
man, or one animal, be one only soul.
