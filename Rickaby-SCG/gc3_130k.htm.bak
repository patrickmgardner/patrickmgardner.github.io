What of the solicitude 'Writ large' in advertisements, 
the eagerness to outstrip rivals and to make a
fortune, the "endless money-making" rebuked by
Aristotle and St Thomas (<i>Aquinas Ethicus</i>, II, 96, 97),
now become the mainspring of human society? Such
solicitude is not wrong in itself, but sin finds an easy
passage under cover of it, as St Thomas goes on to say,
with St Paul, 1 Tim. vi, 9, 10; cf. Luke viii, 14.
