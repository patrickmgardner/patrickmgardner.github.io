<H1>That Intelligent Creatures are the Medium through which other

SINCE the preservation of order in creation is a concern of divine 
providence, and it is a congruous order to descend by steps of due 
proportion from highest to lowest,<A HREF="gc3_78a.htm">*</a> divine 
providence must reach by a certain rule of proportion to the lowest 
things. The rule of proportion in this, that as the highest creatures 
are under God and are governed by Him, so lower creatures should be 
under the higher and be governed by them. But of all creatures 
intelligent creatures are the highest (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_49.htm">XLIX</a>). Therefore the plan of divine providence 
requires that other creatures should be governed by rational 
creatures.<A HREF="gc3_78b.htm">*</a><p>
