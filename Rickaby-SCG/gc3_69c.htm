That is to say, the proofs are <i>a posteriori</i>, resting
on experience. The order of nature is an historical
order, particularly in its coexistences. It may be 
objected that the physicist may prescind entirely from
the question agitated in this chapter. So indeed he
may. But St Thomas's 'natural science' includes physics 
and metaphysics. Metaphysics rest on an <i>a posteriori</i> 
basis of sensory experience. The enquiries in
Aristotle's eight books of Physics are chiefly metaphysical. 
No doubt, physics have gained by being made
a speciality, apart from metaphysics. The former is
the lower, the latter the higher science. You may stop
short of the higher: but you can be no great master
of the higher if you are quite a novice in the lower.
<i>Nemo metaphysicus quin idem physicus</i>.
