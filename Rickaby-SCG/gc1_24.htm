<H1>That the Existence of God cannot he characterised
by the addition of any Substantial Differentia<A 
HREF="gc1_24a.htm">*</a></h1> 

IT is impossible for anything actually to be, unless all things exist 
whereby its substantial being is characterised.  An animal cannot 
actually be without being either a rational or an irrational animal. 
Hence the Platonists, in positing Ideas, did not posit self-existent 
Ideas of <i>genera</i>, seeing that <i>genera</i> are characterised and 
brought to specific being by addition of essential differentias; but 
they posited self-existent Ideas of species alone, seeing that for the 
(further) characterising of species (in the individuals belonging to 
it) there is no need of essential differentias.<A 
HREF="gc1_24b.htm">*</a> If then the existence of God is characterised 
and receives an essential characteristic by the addition of something 
else, that existence will not of itself actually be except by having 
that other thing superadded to it. But the existence of God is His own 
very substance, as has been shown. It would follow that the substance 
of God could not actually be except by something supervening upon it; 
and thence the further conclusion would ensue that the substance of God 
is not of itself necessarily existent, the contrary of which has been 
shown above (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_15.htm">XV</a>, n. 4)<P>

2. Everything that needs something superadded to enable it to be, is in 
potentiality in respect of that addition. Now the divine substance is 
not in any way in potentiality, as has been shown <A 
(Chap. HREF="gc1_16.htm">XVI</a>), but God's own substance is God's own 
being. Therefore His existence cannot be characterised by any 
superadded substantial characteristic.
