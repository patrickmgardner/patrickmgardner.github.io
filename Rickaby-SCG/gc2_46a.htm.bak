So in the Ptolemaic system of concentric spheres making the 
heavens, the sphere of the moon would "comprehend and contain" the 
earth. Perhaps we might substitute some consideration like the 
following: that the orbit of the primary planet carries with it and in 
a manner contains the orbit of the satellite: earth and earth-way carry 
and involve moon and moon-way; while the sun carries all the planets, 
and all their 'ways' or orbits.
