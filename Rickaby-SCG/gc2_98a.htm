A 'proper term of intellect' is a form apart from matter, as 
'brightness,' 'clearness,' 'lucidity,' apart from 'this bright button,' 
'this clear sky.' The separation of the form apart from matter is 
either physical or logical. Where the separation is logical only, the 
form cannot really exist except in matter; and from matter the human 
intellect gathers it by abstraction and generalisation. The angel 
somehow gathers the same form without having to study the matter in 
which it resides. But when the form is physically distinct from 
matter, - when it subsists by itself, -- such an immaterial, subsisting 
form lives and understands: it is an angel. An angel, according to St 
Thomas, is a personified form, quality, or attribute: what attribute 
exactly, it is not for us to say. We men cannot "count the host of 
heaven, and call them by their names."
