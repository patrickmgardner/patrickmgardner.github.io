We cannot exaggerate our dependence on one
heavenly body, the sun. As well have no earth as no
sun. To the moon we owe the tides; and to the
planets it is just possible that we stand indebted for
some of our weather. The fixed stars are of use to us
in navigation. Otherwise, so far as we can see, Mother
Earth would go her way and carry all her children
safe, with no other companions than sun and moon,
or, for that matter, the sun only, though all other
'heavenly bodies' were wiped out of existence.
