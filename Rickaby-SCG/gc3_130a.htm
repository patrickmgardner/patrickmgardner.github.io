St Thomas's words exactly define what is called
in English law an 'overt act.' Overt acts apart, the
maxim holds, <i>De aeternis non judicat praetor</i>.  A godless
morality relieves a man of responsibility for all the
secret workings of his will, -- not that it declares them
all right, but it removes them from the province of
law and legal sanction.
