Sabellius, an African from the neighbourhood
of Cyrene, in the early third century, an anti-Trinitarian, 
taught that one and the same divine Being as
giving the Old Law was called the Father, as born
of Mary was called the Son, as given to the Apostles
was called the Holy Ghost, so that there were three
manifestations, but not what we should call three
Persons; and that when God was under one of these
manifestations, He was not under either of the other two.
