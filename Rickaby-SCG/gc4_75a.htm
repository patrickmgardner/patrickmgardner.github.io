These three Orders, though still given, have long ceased to be 
exercised by their immediate recipients. Their functions are now 
virtually discharged by priests in the various occupations of their 
ministry, -- e.g., by care of Church property, or by refusal to receive 
into the Church ill-prepared converts; by lecturing and writing on 
behalf of the faith; by arguing, entreating, rebuking members of the 
flock who lie under some diabolical infatuation.<p>
