This argument for the infinity seems to make against the personality of 
God.  "An actuality that is in none," it will be said, is no one's 
actuality. If personality is some sort of limitation, how can the 
infinite be other than the impersonal?  This ground is beset with 
formidable difficulties. See <i>General Metaphysics</i>, Stonyhurst 
Series, p. 282. Such reply as I can make is the following: I would 
rather call personality an <i>exclusiveness</i> than a 
<i>limitation</i>.  Then I might observe that the three Persons of the 
Blessed Trinity, while having one and the same nature in common, are 
mutually exclusive of one another as Persons. But as this mystery lies 
beyond the ken of philosophy, I prefer to reply that the actuality of 
God is exclusive of absolutely everything that comes within our direct 
cognition: it is exclusive of the entire universe. So St Thomas, though 
not so the pantheistic school, who make their Absolute formally 
inclusive of all. Here surely is a great difference. God then, 
according to St Thomas, is not infinite in the sense of formally 
containing within His own being, as part of Himself, the being of this 
world. He is distinct with a real, physical distinction from the 
universe which He has created. He is infinite, not as being identified 
with the universe, but as being infinitely above it: and better than 
it, so far above it and so far better than it that the universe, as 
compared with His being, has in that comparison no being and no 
goodness at all.  See last note in Chapter <A HREF="gc1_16.htm">XVI</a>. 
True, His actuality is "in none," but that is because it is complete 
and perfect in itself, individualised in itself, filling up the measure 
of divinity and identified with it, so that there can be no second God, 
and none could possibly be God but He who is God. Thus God can be 
called by no proper name, as Michael or John, applied to angel and to 
man, to distinguish one individual from his compeers. Is not this 
completeness and exclusiveness to be called personality? Personality, a 
distinguishing perfection of the highest of creatures, cannot well be 
denied to the most perfect of beings, their Creator.
