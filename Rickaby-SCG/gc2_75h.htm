<i>Individuatio fit per hanc materiam signatam</i>. For <i>materia 
signata</i> see <A HREF="gc1_63b.htm">B. I, Chap. LXIII, p. 45, 
note</a>. The doctrine that matter is the principle of individuation is 
one of the most intricate in the scholastic system, and cannot be 
entered upon here.<p> 

Things 'not actually intelligible' nevertheless are potentially 
intelligible: i.e., they lend themselves to a process of de-
particularising under the active intellect; and so as universals become 
actual terms of intellect. This is explained at length in Chap. 
LXXVII.
