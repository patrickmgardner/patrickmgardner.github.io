There is always an ambiguity in this term of 'mere existence,' <i>ipsum 
esse,</i> <A HREF="gc1_25a1.htm"><b>auto to einai</b></a>.  Either it 
means <i>ens abstractissimum,</i> the thinnest and shallowest of 
concepts, denoting the barest removal from nothingness: or it is <i>ens 
plenissimum</i>, being that includes (virtually at least) all other 
being, as the Platonic <A HREF="gc1_25a2.htm"><b>auto to kalon</b></a>
virtually includes all beauty.  In this latter sense the term is 
predicable of God alone. In God 'mere existence' means pure actuality.
