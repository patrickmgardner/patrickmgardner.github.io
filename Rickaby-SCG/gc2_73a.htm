See Chap. LXXVI. Alexander, Avicenna, and Averroes, are all at one 
against St Thomas, in affirming the one universal intellect. Thus 
Averroes writes (in Aristot., <i>De anima</i>, III, v): "We agree with 
Alexander in his mode of explaining the active intellect; and differ 
from him as to the nature of the potential intellect." If Alexander and 
Avicenna do not expressly affirm the oneness and universality of the 
potential intellect, the reason is, because they thought it enough to 
affirm the universality of the 'active intellect'; and did not so 
clearly as Averroes and St Thomas (see Chap. <a 
href="gc2_60.htm">LX</a>) mark off from the spiritual 'potential 
intellect' the organic and perishable 'passive intellect' (<b>ho de 
path&ecirc;tikos nous phthartos</b>. <i>De anima</i>, III, v, 3). In 
this dispute about the one universal intellect these two questions 
should be kept distinct:<p> <ul> <li>A. Do Alexander, Avicenna, and 
Averroes, or does Aquinas, speak the true mind of Aristotle? <li>B. In 
point of psychological fact, is the truth with St Thomas or with his 
three opponents? </ul><p> 

A. On the former question I observe that there is no complete and 
coherent account of <b>nous</b> in Aristotle, so that any commentator 
who will give such a complete account is obliged to overshoot his 
author. The question then comes to this: On which side is Aristotle's 
meaning eked out with least violence to what he actually says? My 
opinion is that St Thomas is the better Aristotelian in speaking of the 
human soul in this world, and Averroes in speaking of the soul in the 
next world. I think that Aristotle would have admitted that the 
intellectual soul is in the body, and is individually multiplied in the 
bodies of individual men. Averroes's theory of the <i>continuatio</i> 
(<i>ittis&acirc;l</i>), or union of the individual passive intellect 
with the universal potential intellect, is to me far fetched, 
inconsistent with the sound sense of Aristotle, a remnant of Moorish 
mysticism (although Averroes himself was no mystic) rather than a 
development of Greek philosophy. But coming to the existence of the 
intellectual soul after death, I fear that the following words of 
Averroes declare the mind of Aristotle more faithfully than St Thomas's 
doctrine of the permanence of as many separate souls as there have been 
bodies. "Of all things the soul is most like light; and as light is 
divided by the division of illuminated bodies, and then becomes one 
when the bodies are taken away, such is the state of souls in their 
relation with their bodies" <i>Destructio destructionum</i>, disp. 1, 
p. 21, ed. 1574). See note p. <a href="gc2_61f.htm">128</a>.<p> 

B. For a Catholic, the second question is settled by the decree of the 
fifth Council of Lateran under Leo X in 1513 against the Averroists of 
the age: "The soul is immortal, and individually multipliable, and 
multiplied according to the multitude of the bodies into which it is 
infused." No Catholic can deny the immortality of the individual soul, 
or hold any view subversive of individual responsibility, as though 
saint and sinner alike were automata, administered by an intelligence 
and will foreign to themselves. The one really Universal Intellect is 
that of God; and the Divine Mind works upon our mortal minds, not 
<i>formally</i>, as a constituent of them, but <i>efficiently</i>, as 
guiding them, while respecting their native liberty. In his work, <i>De 
animae beatitudine</i> cap. iii, Averroes says very justly that the 
active intellect is so called, not merely in an <i>efficient</i>, but 
in a <i>formal</i> sense. "The active intellect is a cause in regard of 
the potential intellect not only by way of efficiency and movement, but 
also by way of final perfection, that is, by way of form and 
consummation" (p. 151). It would then be pantheism, which even Averroes 
avoids, to make God the 'active intellect' of the world, in the 
Aristotelian sense. But God is the <i>efficiently</i> illuminating 
intellect of all other intellects. The <i>modus operandi</i> whereby 
God acts upon the minds of mortal men, whether indirectly through 
sensible objects, or in any more direct way, is an interesting and 
comparatively unexplored region of psychology. The intellectual is 
allowed on all hands to be the universal; and the universal is our 
natural avenue to the divine. "Material forms," says Averroes, "when 
abstracted in the soul from their matters, become science and 
understanding; and understanding is nothing else than forms abstracted 
from matter, nothing else than a comprehension of things understood, 
nothing else than a comprehension of the order of the world" 
(<i>Destructio destructionum</i>, disp. 6, p. 86). He goes on to show 
how intellect is impeded and retarded by having to study these forms in 
matter.<p> 

Mental experience, a witness too little heard in this discussion, 
reveals to us this fact, that the more absorbed we are in intellectual 
occupation, the more forgetful we are of ourselves. Aristotle places 
happiness in contemplation; and contemplation is a process of being 
universalised and de-individualised. The <b>path&ecirc;</b> of our animal 
organism, our bodily needs and apprehensions, drive us back upon 
ourselves. Happiness puts us out of ourselves: misery is a painful 
consciousness of self. Some such painful isolation in the next world, 
some state in which the soul is driven in upon itself, excluded from 
the universal truth and universal good, and as it were crushed within 
its own individuality, may be the penal consequence of selfishness and 
sin.<p>
 
Phantastic and objectionable on many points as Averroes is, there is a 
world of thought in Averroism; and his great opponent St Thomas owes 
not a little to the Commentator. Renan indeed goes the length of 
saying: <i>Albert (Albertus Magnus) doit tout &agrave; Avicenne; Saint Thomas, 
comme philosophe, presque tout &agrave; l'Averroisme</i> (<i>Averroes et 
l'Averroisme</i> p. 236).<p>

The reader may consult Roger Bede Vaughan's <i>St Thomas of Aquin</i> 
(Longmans, 1875), vol. I, pp. 300, 301, for Averroes's doctrine of 
the passive and active intellect; and vol. II, pp. 799-809, for an 
analysis of St Thomas's <i>Opuculum de unitate intellectus</i>.<p>
