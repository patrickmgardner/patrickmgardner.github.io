The mystery which is beyond understanding is
likewise beyond imagination. The exercise of imagination 
upon the mysteries of faith is a necessary and
wholesome process: it is part of mental prayer. But
the result remains quite inadequate to the object.
Forgetting this piece of psychology, people take for
objectively incredible that which is subjectively 
unimaginable: and the childish shortcomings and vagaries 
of the imagination are mistaken for absurdities
in the mystery proposed for belief, as a boy astronomer 
might mistake the effect of chromatic aberration
in his telescope for colours in the stars. Dulness of
imagination is a great obstacle to religious belief.
