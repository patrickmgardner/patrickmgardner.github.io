St Thomas here speaks of moral, not of physical 
goodness. All creatures are physically good in themselves 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc3_7.htm">VII</a>); but what is morally good 
for us is not the mere having and enjoying of this or
that particular creature, but the use that we put it
to. Possessions perish and change hands: the credit
of the use we put them to alone is eternal. <i>Their
works follow them</i> (Apoc. xiv, 13).
