Is the power 'to consider this or that' anything more than an 
application of the power 'actually to consider or to cease from 
considering'?  I merely move the question, which is one of some 
subtlety. -- The latter half of this chapter contains the one thorough-
going refutation, perhaps, ever given of the determinism of Socrates 
and Plato, who reduced moral to intellectual error, and put it beyond 
the control of the will.
