<H1>That Subsistent Intelligences are Imperishable</h1>

WHAT ordinarily and of itself attaches to a thing, inheres in it  
necessarily and invariably and inseparably, as roundness ordinarily  
and of itself inheres in a circle, but in a bit of brass metal only 
incidentally.<A HREF="gc2_55a.htm">*</a> It is possible for a bit of 
brass metal to be other than round: it is impossible for a circle to be 
other than round. Now existence ordinarily follows upon the form: for 
we call that 'ordinary,' which the thing is inasmuch as it is itself; 
and everything has existence inasmuch as it has form. Substances 
therefore that are not pure forms may be deprived of existence inasmuch 
as they lose their form, as brass is deprived of roundness inasmuch as 
it ceases to be circular. But substances that are pure forms are never 
deprived of existence: thus if the ideal circle had substantial 
existence, that substance could never be made other than round. But 
subsistent intelligences are pure subsistent forms: therefore it is 
impossible for them ever to cease to exist.<A 
HREF="gc2_55b.htm">*</a><p> 

8. Everything that perishes, perishes by suffering something. 
Destruction is a sort of suffering. But no subsistent intelligence can 
suffer any impression such as to lead to its destruction. For to suffer 
is to receive something; and whatever is received in a subsistent 
intelligence must be received according to the manner of the same: that 
is to say, it must be received as an intelligible impression. But 
whatever is so received in a subsistent intelligence, goes to perfect 
that intelligence, not to destroy it: for the intelligible is the 
perfection of the intelligent. A subsistent intelligence therefore is 
indestructible.<A HREF="gc2_55c.htm">*</a><p> 

10. The intelligible is the proper perfection of the intellect: hence 
the understanding in the act of understanding, and its term, or object 
in the act of being understood, are one.<A HREF="gc2_55d.htm">*</a> 
What therefore belongs to the object as intelligible, must belong also 
to the mind as cognisant of that object; because perfection and 
perfectible are of the same genus.<A HREF="gc2_55e.htm">*</a> Now the 
intelligible object, as such, is necessary and imperishable: for things 
necessary, or things that must be, are perfectly cognisable to the 
understanding; while things contingent, that are but might not be, as 
such, are cognisable only imperfectly: they are not matter of science, 
but of opinion.<A HREF="gc2_55f.htm">*</a> Hence the understanding 
attains to science of perishable things, only in so far as they are 
imperishable, -- that is to say, in so far as they become to the mind 
universals. Intellect therefore, as such, must be indestructible.<A 
HREF="gc2_55g.htm">*</a><p> 

13. It is impossible for a natural desire to be void of object, for 
nature does nothing in vain. But every intelligence naturally desires 
perpetuity of being, not only perpetuity of being in the species, but 
in the individual: which is thus shown. The natural desire which some 
creatures have arises from conscious apprehension: thus the wolf 
naturally desires the killing of the animals on which he feeds, and man 
naturally desires happiness. Other creatures, without any conscious 
apprehension, are led by the inclination of primitive physical 
tendencies, which is called in some 'physical appetite.' The natural 
desire of being is contained under both modes: the proof of which is 
that creatures devoid of any sort of cognitive faculty resist 
destructive agencies to the full strength of their natural 
constitution, while creatures possessed of any manner of cognitive 
faculty resist the same according to the mode of their cognition. Those 
creatures therefore, devoid of cognition, who have in their natural 
constitution strength enough to preserve perpetual being, so as to 
remain always the same numerically, have a natural appetite for 
perpetuity of being even in respect of sameness of number: while those 
whose natural constitution has not strength for this, but only for 
preservation of perpetuity of being in respect of sameness of species, 
also have a natural appetite for perpetuity. This difference then must 
be noted in those creatures whose desire of being is attended with 
cognition, that they who do not know being except in the present time, 
desire it for the present time, but not for ever, because they have no 
apprehension of everlasting existence: still they desire the perpetual 
being of their species, a desire unattended with cognition, because the 
generative power, which serves that end, is preliminary to and does not 
come under cognition. Those then that do know and apprehend perpetual 
being as such, desire the same with a natural desire. But this is the 
case with all subsistent intelligences. All such subsistent 
intelligences therefore have a natural desire of everlasting being. 
Therefore they cannot possibly cease to be.<p>

13. All things that begin to be, and afterwards cease to be, have both 
their beginning and their ceasing from the same power: for the same is 
the power to make to be and to make not to be. But subsistent 
intelligences could not begin to be except through the power of the 
prime agent. Therefore neither is there any power to make them cease to 
be except in the prime agent, inasmuch as that agent may cease to pour 
being into them. But in respect of this power alone nothing can be 
called perishable; as well because things are called necessary or 
contingent in respect of the power that is in them, not in respect of 
the power of God (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_30.htm">XXX</a>), as also because 
God, the author of nature, does not withdraw from things that which is 
proper to their nature; and it has been shown that it is proper to 
intellectual natures to be perpetual.<p>
