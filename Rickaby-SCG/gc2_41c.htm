<i>Ens privativum</i>. A <i>privation</i> as distinguished from a 
mere negation, is the lack of a perfection due to the nature, as the 
lack of sense in this or that man, not the lack of wings. Privation is 
in the individual only, never in the species. Hence all evil is in the 
individual: the specific nature is entirely good.
