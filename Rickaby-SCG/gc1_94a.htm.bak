<i>Intellectus</i>.  This word in St Thomas means sometimes the faculty 
of 'understanding'; sometimes, as here, the act, or habit of 
understanding, of which so much is made in modern philosophy under the 
name of 'intuition.' St Thomas too makes much of it. Thus his 
<i>intellectus principiorum</i> is 'intuition of first principles.' The 
corresponding Aristotelian and Platonic word is <A HREF="gc1_94a1.htm">
<b>nous</b></a> as distinguished from <A HREF="gc1_94a2.htm"> 
<b>dianoia</b></a>. Kant's 'Reason' is his equivalent for 
<A HREF="gc1_94a1.htm"><b>nous</b></a> and <i>intellectus</i>. </BODY>
