In this chapter St Thomas labours to dispel the
difficulties of <i>ittis&acirc;l</i>, that conjunction of 
the human mind with a superior intelligence, which Averroes
and the Arabian school dreamt of; and thought to
see fulfilled in this life (B. II, Chapp. 
<A HREF="gc2_59.htm">LIX</a> sq.)
which is fulfilled, although in a different manner, by
Christian faith and charity, sanctifying grace and
sacraments; which has its perfect fulfilment in the
beatific vision. It is <i>a white counter, inscribed with
a new name, which none knoweth but him who receiveth</i>
(Apoc. ii, 17). I mean, there are difficulties in the
explanation of it, beyond the power of mortal faculties 
to solve.
