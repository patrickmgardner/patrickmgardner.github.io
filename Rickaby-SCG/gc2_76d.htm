St Thomas refers to <i>Metaph.</i> VII, viii (now VI vii), apparently 
to such words as these: <b>kathalou de kai ex hou phusis, kai kath ho 
phusis, to de gignomenon echei phusis, hoion phuton &ecirc; 
z&ocirc;on</b> (universally, the source whence a thing proceeds is 
nature, and the process nature, and the product is natural as a plant 
or an animal). This means that 'natural,' i.e. 'organic,' beings attain 
to a certain completeness, proper to themselves, by a development of 
their own powers they are self-contained and self-sufficient for their 
own purposes: they draw indeed their supplies from without, but they 
adapt what they receive to their own purposes by their own activity.
