<H1>How Separately Subsisting Spirits work certain Wonders, which yet 
are not true Miracles</h1>

IT was the theory of Avicenna that matter is far more obedient to 
spiritual agencies than to the action of contraries in nature. Hence he 
goes on to say that upon the suggestion of these spiritual agents there 
sometimes follows an effect in the lower world, such as rain, or the 
cure of some sick person, without the coming in of any intermediate 
corporeal agency. He instances the change wrought in the body by the 
mere suggestion of a strong impression of phantasy, as when one walking 
upon a plank set aloft easily falls, because his fear pictures a fall 
to him, whereas he would not fall if the same plank were laid on the 
ground, giving him no occasion to fear. Again it is notorious that upon 
the mere suggestion of the soul the body grows hot, as in desire or 
anger, or is chilled, as in fear. Sometimes too a strong suggestion 
brings on an illness, a fever, or even leprosy. Thereupon Avicenna says 
that if the soul is pure, not subject to bodily passions, and strong in 
its suggestive power, not only its own body will obey its suggestion, 
but even foreign bodies, even to the healing of the sick upon 
suggestion made by it.<A HREF="gc3_103a.htm">*</a> And this he thought 
to be the cause of the evil eye (<i>fascinationis</i>), that any soul 
having a strong affection of malevolence is capable of making a noxious 
impression on another, particularly on a child, who for the tenderness 
of his constitution is readily susceptible of such impressions. Hence 
he concludes that much more does an effect in this lower world follow 
upon the suggestion of pure spirits, without the action of any bodily 
agent. And this position tallies well enough with his other theories: 
for he supposes that all substantial forms in this lower world are 
effluxes from a pure spirit, and that bodily agents do no more than 
prepare the matter to receive the impression of the separately 
subsisting spiritual agent.<A HREF="gc3_103b.htm">*</a> But this is not 
true according to the doctrine of Aristotle, who proves that such forms 
as are in matter arise from other forms which are also in matter, for 
thus is maintained the likeness between maker and made.<p> 

The fact is, a created spirit has no power of its own to induce any 
form upon corporeal matter otherwise than by setting some body into 
local motion. This much is in the power of a created spirit, to make a 
body obey it to the extent of moving locally. So by moving a body 
locally an angel can employ natural agents to the production of certain 
effects. But such action is not miraculous, properly speaking.<A 
HREF="gc3_103c.htm">*</a> Hence it remains true that created spirits 
do not work miracles of their own power. But there is nothing against 
their working miracles inasmuch as they work in the power of God, as 
appears from the fact that one choir of angels is especially told off, 
as Gregory says, to work miracles.<A HREF="gc3_103d.htm">*</a>     
Gregory further says that some saints sometimes work miracles by an act 
of power, and not merely by intercession.<A HREF="gc3_103e.htm">*</a>
