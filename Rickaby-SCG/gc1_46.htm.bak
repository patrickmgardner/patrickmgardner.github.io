<H1>That God understands by nothing else than by
His own Essence</h1>

UNDERSTANDING is brought actually to understand by an impression made 
on the understanding, just as sense comes actually to feel by an 
impression made on sense. The impression made on the understanding then 
is to the understanding as actuality to potentiality. If therefore the 
divine understanding came to understand by any impression made on the 
understanding other than the understanding itself, the understanding 
would be in potentiality towards that impression, which, it has been 
shown, cannot be (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_16.htm">XVI</a>, <A 
HREF="gc1_17.htm">XVII</a>).<P>

3. Any impression on the understanding that is in the understanding 
over and above its essence, has an accidental being: by reason of which 
fact our knowledge reckons as an accident. But there can be no accident 
in God.<P>

Therefore there is not in His understanding any impression besides the 
divine essence itself.
