'Immaterial' means 'stripped of individual particularities.' It does 
not quite mean 'abstract': for you might 'immaterialise,' or 
'universalise,' let us say, the whole of Nelson's monument, so far as 
contour and structure go. It is not true, as associationists have 
taught, that the sight of a house ordinarily brings up to my 
consciousness impressions of similar buildings which I have seen: all 
that I am conscious of is the image of this house now before me: but in 
considering it as a <i>house</i> I consider it apart from the 
<i>thisness</i>; and so doing I am said to 'purify it of material,' 
i.e., particular 'conditions.' This explains what St Thomas says 
presently, "what is inconsistent with intelligibility, is materiality." 
You cannot understand 'house' in such a way that your intelligence is 
limited to this house now before you, so that, if you happened to 
encounter another, you would not know what it was. To understand is 
<i>to take for a type</i>.
