A WORD in conclusion from the translator, or restorer. There has been 
present in my mind throughout my task the figure which I employed in 
the preface, of the restoration of a thirteenth-century church. I find 
myself surrounded with debris which I have found it necessary to remove 
from the structure of the <i>Contra Gentiles</i>: -- Ptolemaic 
astronomy pervading the work even to the last chapter; a theory of 
divine providence adapted to this obsolete astronomy (B. III, Chapp. 
XXII, XXIII, LXXXII, XCI, XCII); an incorrect view of motion (B. I, 
Chap. XIII); archaic embryology (B. II, Chapp. LXXXVI, LXXXIX); total 
ignorance of chemistry, and even of the existence of molecular physics: 
deficient scholarship, leading at times to incorrect exegesis (B. IV, 
Chap. VII, #5: Chap. XVII, #2: Chap. XXXIV in Heb. ii, 10): even a 
theology of grace and the Sacraments that might here and there have 
expressed itself otherwise had the writer lived subsequently to the 
Council of Trent and the Baian and Jansenist controversies (B. III, 
Chap. L): finally, an over-cultivation of genera and species, that 
is, of logical classification, issuing in a tendency to deductive 
argument from essences downwards to effects, as though whatever is 
most valuable in human knowledge could be had by the Aristotelian 
method of 'demonstration,' with comparatively slight regard to 
observation and experiment, to critical, historical, and <i>a 
posteriori</i> methods generally.<p> 

It may be asked: Seeing that St Thomas is so often at fault in matter 
where his doctrines have come under the test of modern experimental 
science and criticism, what confidence can be reposed in him on other 
points, where his conclusions lie beyond the reach of experience? To a 
Catholic the answer is simple enough; and it shall be given in St 
Thomas's own words: "Our faith reposes on the revelation made to the 
Apostles and Prophets who have written the Canonical Books, not on any 
revelation that may have been made to other Doctors" (<i>Sum. 
Theol.</i> I, q. 8 ad 2, -- the context is worth reading). Our 
confidence is limited in conclusions of mere reason, by whomsoever 
drawn: our confidence is unlimited in matters of faith, as taught by 
the Church (B. I, Chapp. <A HREF="gc1_3.htm">III</a>-VI). The 
practical value of the <i>Summa contra Gentiles</i> lies in its 
exposition of the origin, nature, duty, and destiny of man, according 
to the scheme of Catholic Christianity. That scheme stands whole and 
entire in the twentieth century as it stood in the thirteenth: in that, 
there is nothing to alter in the <i>Contra Gentiles</i>: it is as 
practical a book as ever it was. The <i>d&eacute;bris</i> are the 
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> of now worn-out human learning, which St Thomas 
used as the best procurable in his day, to encase and protect the 
structure of faith. Or, to express myself in terms of the philosophy of 
our day, dogma has not changed, but our 'apperception' of it, or the 
'mental system' into which we receive it. So the <i>Summa contra 
Gentiles</i> stands, like the contemporary edifices of Ely and 
Lincoln: it stands, and it will stand, because it was built by a Saint 
and a man of genius on the rock of faith.<p> 

The <i>Summa contra Gentiles</i> is an historical monument of the first 
importance for the history of philosophy. In the variety of its 
contents, it is a perfect encyclopaedia of the learning of the day. By 
it we can fix the high water mark of thirteenth-century thought: -- for 
it contains the lectures of a Doctor second to none in the greatest 
school of thought then flourishing, the University of Paris. It is by 
the study of such books that one enters into the mental life of the 
period at which they were written; not by the hasty perusal of 
Histories of Philosophy. No student of the <i>Contra Gentiles</i> is 
likely to acquiesce in the statement, that the Middle Ages were a time 
when mankind seemed to have lost the power of thinking for themselves. 
Mediaeval people thought for themselves, thoughts curiously different 
from ours, and profitable for us to study.<p> 

Lastly, the <i>Summa contra Gentiles</i> is <b>mega tekm&ecirc;rion</b> 
-- considering the ravages of six and a half centuries of time upon 
what was once the most harmonious blending of faith with the science of 
the day, -- it is a fact of solemn admonition to all Doctors and 
Professors of Philosophy and Theology within the Church of Christ, that 
they should be at least as solicitous as an English Dean and Chapter 
now are, for the keeping in yearly repair of the great edifice given 
over to their custody; that they should regard with watchful and 
intelligent eyes the advance of history, anthropology, criticism and 
physical science; and that in their own special sciences they should 
welcome, and make every sane endeavour to promote, what since 1845 has 
been known as the Development of Doctrine.
