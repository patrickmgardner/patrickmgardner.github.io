<H1>That by certain Sensible Rites our mind is directed to God</h1>

BECAUSE it is connatural to man to gather his knowledge through the 
senses, and most difficult for him to transcend sensible things God has 
provided for man that even in sensible things there should be made for 
him a commemoration of things divine. To this end sensible sacrifices 
have been instituted, which man offers to God, not as though God needed 
them, but to bring home to man the lesson that he ought to offer 
himself and all he has to God, his end, Creator, Ruler, and Lord of 
all. There are also exercised upon man certain hallowings through 
certain sensible things, whereby man is washed, or anointed, or given 
to eat and drink, along with the utterance (<i>prolatione</i>) of 
audible words, to represent to man by these sensible signs the 
augmentation of spiritual gifts wrought in him from without, namely, by 
God, whose name is expressed in audible words. Also certain sensible 
rites are performed by men, not to rouse God to action,<A 
HREF="gc3_119a.htm">*</a> but to prompt themselves to divine service. 
Of this nature are prostrations, genuflections, vocal cries and chants: 
which things are not done as though God had need of them, who knows 
all, even the affection of the mind, -- whose will is unchangeable 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc3_105.htm">XCV</a>), and who moreover does not accept 
the movement of the body for its own sake:<A HREF="gc3_119b.htm">*</a> 
but we do these things on our own behalf, that by these sensible rites 
our intention may be directed to God and our affection inflamed. At the 
same time also we hereby make profession of God being author of our 
soul and body, in that we pay Him acts of homage spiritual and 
bodily.<A HREF="gc3_119c.htm">*</a><p> 

Hence it is not surprising that the [Manichean] heretics, who say that 
God is not the author of our body, blame these bodily observances being 
paid to God. In which censure they evidently fail to remember that they 
themselves are men, not seeing that sensible representations are 
necessary to us for inward knowledge and affection. For it is 
experimentally shown that our soul is excited by bodily acts to think 
and feel: hence we properly use such acts to raise our mind to God.<p> 

In the payment of these bodily observances the <i>cult</i>, or 
<i>worship</i>, of God is said to consist. For we are said to 
<i>cultivate</i> those objects to which we pay attention by our works. 
Now we busy ourselves in paying attention to the things of God, not as 
though we were of <i>service</i> to Him, as is the case when we are 
said to <i>tend</i>, or <i>cultivate</i>, other things by our 
attentions, but because such actions are of <i>service</i> to 
ourselves, enabling us to come nearer to God.<A 
HREF="gc3_119d.htm">*</a> And because by inward acts we go straight to 
God, therefore it is by inward acts properly that we worship God: 
nevertheless outward acts also belong to the cult, or worship, of God, 
inasmuch as by such acts our mind is raised to God, as has been 
said.<p> 

Hence the worship of God is also called <i>religion</i>, because by 
such acts a man in some sort binds (<i>ligat</i>) himself, that his 
thought may not wander astray from God; and also because by a sort of 
natural instinct he feels himself bound (<i>obligatum</i>) to God, that 
in such manner as he can he should pay reverence to Him from whom is 
the origin of his being and of all his good.<A HREF="gc3_119e.htm">*</a><p> 

Hence also religion has received the name of <i>piety</i>, for piety is 
that whereby we pay due honour to parents: hence aptly the honour paid 
to God, parent of all, is taken to be a part of piety, and they who 
oppose the worship of God are called <i>impious</i>.<p> 

But because not only is God cause and origin of our being, but our 
whole being is in His power, and all that is in us is His due, and 
thereby He is truly our Lord and Master, therefore what we perform in 
honour of God is called <i>service</i>. Now God is our master not by 
accident, as one man is another's master, but by nature; and therefore 
the service that we owe to God is quite different from that whereby we 
are accidentally subject to a man, the dominion of man over man being 
partial, and derivative from God. Hence the service specially due to 
God is called among the Greeks <i>latria</i>.<A HREF="gc3_119f.htm">*</a>
