The eighth sphere of solid crystal carried all
the fixed stars, set in it like stones in a ring. Beyond
that was a ninth: and the tenth and outermost sphere
was the <i>primum mobile</i>, the daily rotation of which
from east to west carried round the inferior spheres.
This is called the Ptolemaic system, but the eight
spheres already figure in Plato, Rep. x, 616d, 617.
