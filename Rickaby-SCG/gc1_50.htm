<H1>That God has a particular Knowledge of all things</h1>

EVERY agent that acts by understanding has a knowledge of what it does, 
reaching to the particular nature of the thing produced; because the 
knowledge of the maker determines the form of the thing made. But God 
is cause of things by His understanding, seeing that in Him to be and 
to understand are one. But everything acts inasmuch as it is in 
actuality. God therefore knows in particular, as distinct from other 
things, whatever He causes to be.<A HREF="gc1_50a.htm">*</a><P> 

3. The collocation of things, distinct and separate, cannot be by 
chance, for it is in regular order.  This collocation of things, then, 
distinct and separate from one another, must be due to the intention of 
some cause. It cannot be due to the intention of any cause that acts by 
physical necessity, because physical nature is determined to one line 
of acton.  Thus of no agent, that acts by physical necessity, can the 
intention reach to many distinct effects, inasmuch as they are 
distinct.<A HREF="gc1_50b.htm">*</a> The distinct arrangement and 
collocation of things must proceed from the intention of some knowing 
cause.<A HREF="gc1_50c.htm">*</a>  Indeed it seems the proper function 
of intellect to remark the distinction of things. It belongs therefore 
to the First Cause, which of itself is distinct from all others, to 
intend the distinct and separate collocation of all the materials of 
the Universe.<P> 

4.  Whatever God knows, He knows most perfectly: for there is in Him 
all perfection (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>). Now what is 
known only in general is not known perfectly: the main points of the 
thing are not known, the finishing touches of its perfection, whereby 
its proper being is completely realised and brought out. Such mere 
general knowledge is rather a perfectible than a perfect knowledge of a 
thing. If therefore God in knowing His essence knows all things in 
their universality, He must also have a particular knowledge of 
things.<P> 

8. Whoever knows any nature, knows whether that nature be communicable: 
for he would not know perfectly the nature of 'animal,' who did not 
know that it was communicable to many. But the divine nature is 
communicable by likeness. God therefore knows in how many ways anything 
may exist like unto His essence. Hence arises the diversity of types, 
inasmuch as they imitate in divers ways the divine essence. God 
therefore has a knowledge of things according to their several 
particular types.<A HREF="gc1_50d.htm">*</a> This also we are taught by 
the authority of canonical Scripture. <i>God saw all things that he had 
made, and they were very good</i> (Gen. i, 31). <i>Nor is there any 
creature invisible in his sight, but all things are naked and open to 
his eyes</i> (Heb. iv, 13).
