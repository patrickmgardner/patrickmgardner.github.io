<H1>That of no Food is the Use Sinful in itself</h1>

EVERYTHING is done rationally, when it is directed according to its due 
bearing upon a due end. But the due end of the taking of food is the 
preservation of the health by nourishment. Therefore whatever food can 
serve that end, may be taken without sin.<p> 

2. Of no thing is the use evil in itself unless the thing itself be 
evil in itself.<A HREF="gc3_127a.htm">*</a> But no food is in its 
nature evil; because everything is in its nature good (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_7.htm">VII</a>); albeit some particular food may be evil to 
some particular person, inasmuch as it makes against his bodily health. 
Therefore of no food, considered as such and such a thing, is the 
partaking a sin in itself: but it may be a sin, if a person uses it 
irrationally and not to his health.<p> 

3. To apply things to the purpose for which they exist is not in itself 
evil. But plants exist for the sake of animals, some animals for the 
sake of others, and all for the sake of man (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_81.htm">LXXXI</a>). Therefore to use either plants, or the 
flesh of animals, either for eating, or for any other purpose for which 
they are useful to man (<i>vel ad quidquid aliud sunt homini 
utilia</i>), is not in itself a sin.<p> 

4. The defect which makes sin redounds from soul to body, but not 
backwards from body to soul: for by sin we mean a disorder of the will. 
But articles of food concern the body immediately, not the soul. 
Therefore the taking of various foods cannot be in itself a sin, except 
in so far as it is inconsistent with rectitude of will. And that may 
come to be in several ways: in one way by some inconsistency with the 
proper end of food, as when for the pleasure of eating one uses food 
that disagrees with health either in kind or in quantity. Another way 
would be when the food becomes not the condition of him who eats it, or 
of the society in which he lives, as when one is more nice in his food 
than his means will allow, or violates the social conventions of those 
with whom he sits at table. A third way would be in the case of certain 
foods prohibited by some special law: thus in the Old Law sundry meats 
were forbidden for what they signified; and in Egypt of old the eating 
of beef was prohibited, lest agriculture should suffer;<A 
HREF="gc3_127b.htm">*</a> and again there is the case of rules 
prohibiting the use of certain foods in order to check the lower 
appetites.<A HREF="gc3_127c.htm">*</a><p> 

Hence the Lord says: <i>Not what entereth in at the mouth defiles a 
man</i> (Matt. xv, 11).<A HREF="gc3_127d.htm">*</a> 

Since eating and the intercourse of the sexes are not things in 
themselves unlawful, and exterior possessions are necessary for getting 
food, for rearing and supporting a family, and other bodily wants, it 
follows that neither is the possession of wealth in itself unlawful, 
provided the order of reason be observed, -- I mean, provided the man 
possesses justly the things that he has, and does not fix the final end 
of his will in them,<A HREF="gc3_127e.htm">*</a> and uses them duly for 
his own and others' profit.<p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of some, who, as Augustine says, "most 
arrogantly called themselves Apostolics, because they did not receive 
into their communion married men and proprietors, such as are many 
monks and clerks whom the Catholic Church now contains: these people 
are heretics, because, separating themselves from the Church, they 
think that there is no hope for other persons who make use of what they 
do without" (<i>De haeresibus</i>, c. 40).<A HREF="gc3_127f.htm">*</a>
