Thus Plato taught, and Aristotle cordially agreed with him. See the 
seventh book Of the <i>Republic</i>, and the <i>Posterior 
Analytics</i>. Plato, Aristotle and the schoolmen based their notions 
of science upon the exact sciences of arithmetic, geometry, and formal 
logic, these being the first sciences developed. With us, the name of 
science has been well-nigh monopolised by the study of physical nature. 
Physical objects certainly belong to the class of things contingent: 
they are, but might not be. This is true: but the physicist does not 
consider his science perfect till he has attained to the knowledge of 
the laws of physical necessity which govern the operations of those 
contingent things. Observation and experiment are preliminary steps to 
science. And physical necessities belong to the region of the eternal. 
A substance, such as chlorine, must act in <i>this</i> or <i>that</i> 
way under those conditions, if ever at any time it is to be at all. 
This is an eternal truth. This is exactly St Thomas's teaching, when he 
says: "The understanding attains to science of perishable things, only 
in so far as they are imperishable, -- that is to say, in so far as 
they become to the mind universals." Cf. I, Chap. <A
