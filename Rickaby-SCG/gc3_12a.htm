A potentiality often remote and vain, as the potentiality of sight when 
the eye is gouged out, or the potentiality of truth and justice in the 
devil.  But the fact remains that all positive physical being, as such, 
is of itself good; and however it be beset with evil, that 
circumstance is strictly accidental.  Cf. Heb. xii, 1, <i>besetting 
sin</i>.  Sin <i>besets</i>, but never quite absorbs, the work of God. 
-- Besides, the philosopher considers the universal, the species, the 
normal thing, rather than the individual and accidental: and the normal 
state of things is good, not evil.
