A man acts upon sensible apprehension to the neglect of rational, when 
he suffers himself to be overcome by wine and women.  A man acts under 
the prompting of reason, suggesting a rational good other than the 
proper object of his will, when he asserts his independence against 
lawful authority.  Independence is a rational good in itself, but 
<i>this</i> independence is not the proper good of <i>this</i> man.  
<i>Pride was not made for man</i> (Ecclus. x, 18), any more than excess 
in drinking.  See <i>Ethics and Natural Law</i>, p. 112, 113.
