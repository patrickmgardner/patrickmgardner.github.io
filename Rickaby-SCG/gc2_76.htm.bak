<H1>That the Active Intellect is not a separately Subsisting 
Intelligence, But a Faculty of the Soul</h1> 

WE may further conclude that neither is the active intellect one in all 
men, as Alexander and Avicenna suppose, though they do not suppose the 
potential intellect to be one in all men.<A HREF="gc2_76a.htm">*</a><p> 

4. Plato supposed knowledge in us to be caused by Ideas, which he took 
to subsist apart by themselves. But clearly the first principle on 
which our knowledge depends is the active intellect. If therefore the 
active intellect is something subsisting apart by itself, the 
difference will be none, or but slight, between this opinion and that 
of Plato, which the Philosopher rejects.<p> 

5. If the active intellect is an intelligence subsisting apart, its 
action upon us will either be continual and uninterrupted, or at least 
we must say that it is not continued or broken off at our pleasure. Now 
its action is to make the impressions on our phantasy actual terms of 
intelligence. Either therefore it will do this always or not always. If 
not always, still it will not do it at our discretion. Either therefore 
we must be always in the act of understanding, or it will not be in our 
power actually to understand when we wish.<A HREF="gc2_76b.htm">*</a><p> 

But it may be said that the active intellect, so far as with it lies, 
is always in action, but that the impressions in our phantasy are not 
always becoming actual terms of intelligence, but only when they are 
disposed thereto; and they are disposed thereto by the act of the 
cogitative faculty, the use of which is in our power; and therefore 
actually to understand is in our power; and this is why not all men 
understand the things whereof they have the impressions in their 
phantasy, because not all have at command a suitable act of the 
cogitative faculty, but only those who are accustomed and trained 
thereto.<A HREF="gc2_76c.htm">*</a><p> 

But this answer does not appear to be altogether sufficient. That the 
impressions in phantasy are marshalled by the cogitative faculty to the 
end that they may become actual terms of understanding and move the 
potential intellect, does not seem a sufficient account, if it be 
coupled with the supposition of the potential intellect being a 
separately subsistent intelligence. This seems to go with the theory of 
those who say that inferior agents supply only predispositions to final 
perfection, but that final perfection is the work of an extrinsic 
agency: which is contrary to the mind of Aristotle:<A 
HREF="gc2_76d.htm">*</a> for the human soul does not appear to be worse 
off for understanding than inferior natures are for their own severally 
proper activities.<p> 

9. In the nature of every cause there is contained a principle 
sufficient for the natural operation of that cause. If the operation 
consists in action, there is at hand an active principle, as we see in 
the powers of the vegetative soul in plants. If the operation consists 
in receiving impressions, there is at hand a passive principle, as we 
see in the sentient powers of animals. But man is the most perfect of 
all inferior causes; and his proper and natural operation is to 
understand, an operation which is not accomplished without a certain 
receiving of impressions, inasmuch as every understanding is determined 
by its object; nor again without action, inasmuch as the intellect 
makes potential into actual terms of understanding. There must 
therefore be in the nature of man a proper principle of both 
operations, to wit, both an active and a potential intellect, and 
neither of them must be separate in being (or physically distinct), 
from the soul of man.<p> 

10. If the active intellect is an intelligence subsisting apart, it is 
clearly above the nature of man. But any activity which a man exercises 
by mere virtue of a supernatural cause is a supernatural activity, as 
the working of miracles, prophecy, and the like effects, which are 
wrought by men in virtue of a divine endowment. Since then man cannot 
understand except by means of the active intellect, it follows, 
supposing that intellect a separately subsistent being, that to 
understand is not an operation proper and natural to man; and thus man 
cannot be defined as intellectual or rational.<p> 

11. No agent works except by some power which is formally in the agent 
as a constituent of its being. But the working both of potential and of 
active intellect is proper to man: for man produces ideas by 
abstraction from phantasms, and receives in his mind those ideas; 
operations which it would never occur to us to think of, did we not 
experience them in ourselves. The principles therefore to which these 
operations are attributable, namely, the potential and the active 
intellect, must be faculties formally existing in us.<p> 

12. A being that cannot proceed to its own proper business without 
being moved thereto by an external principle, is rather driven to act 
than acts of itself. This is the case with irrational creatures. Sense, 
moved by an exterior sensible object, makes an impression on the 
phantasy; and so in order the impression proceeds through all the 
faculties till it reaches those which move the rest. Now the proper 
business of man is to understand; and the prime mover in understanding 
is the active intellect, which makes intellectual impressions whereby 
the potential intellect is impressed; which potential intellect, when 
actualised, moves the will. If then the active intellect has a separate 
subsistence outside man, the whole of man's activity depends on an 
extrinsic principle. Man then will not be his own leader, but will be 
led by another; and thus will not be master of his own acts, nor 
deserve praise nor blame; and the whole of moral science and political 
society will perish: an awkward conclusion. Therefore the active 
intellect has no subsistence apart from man.<p>
