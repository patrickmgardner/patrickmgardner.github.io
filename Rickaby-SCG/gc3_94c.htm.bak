St Thomas evidently considers this conclusion
absurd. The only absurdity that I see in it arises from
free will entering in as an element in some portion
of the conduct of the robbers and their victim. 
Substitute a terrier and a rabbit, and the chain of 
physical causation, from eating salt vegetables to being
worried by a dog, is necessary, so long as all the 
relevant antecedents in the case, positive and negative,
remain unaltered.
