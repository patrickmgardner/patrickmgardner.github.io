<h1>That God wills things even that as yet are not</h1>

SOME one might perhaps think that God wills only the things that are: 
for correlatives go together; and if one perishes, the other perishes; 
if then willing supposes a relation of the willing subject to the 
object willed, none can will any but things that are. Besides, the will 
and its objects are to one another as Creator and creature: now God 
cannot be called Creator, or Lord, or Father, except of things that 
are: neither then can He be said to will any but things that are. And 
it may be further argued, that if the divine will is invariable, as is 
the divine being, and wills only actual existences, it wills nothing 
but what always is.<p> 

Let us say then in answer to these objections, that as good apprehended 
by the intellect moves the will, the act of the will must follow the 
condition of the mental apprehension. Now the mind apprehends the 
thing, not only as it is in the mind, but also as it is in its own 
nature: for we not only know that the thing is understood by us (for 
that is the meaning of its being 'in the mind'), but also that the 
thing exists, or has existed, or is to exist in its own nature. Though 
then at the time the thing has no being other than in the mind, still 
the mind stands related to it, not as it is in the mind, but as it is 
in its own nature, which the mind apprehends. Therefore the relation of 
the divine will to a non-existent thing is to the thing according as it 
is in its own nature, attached to some certain time, and not merely to 
the thing as it is in the knowledge of God. For God wills the thing, 
that is not now, to be in some certain time: He does not merely will it 
inasmuch as He Himself understands it.<a href="gc1_79a.htm">*</a> Nor 
is the relation of the will to its object similar to the relation of 
Creator to creature, of Maker to made, of Lord to subject. For will, 
being an immanent act, does not involve the actual external existence 
of the thing willed:<a href="gc1_79b.htm">*</a> whereas making and 
creating and governing do signify an action terminated to an external 
effect, such that without its existence such action is 
unintelligible.
