The difficulty is that untractableness of the 
concept of Not Being, which is enlarged upon by 
Plato, <i>Sophist</i>, 237 sq.  In so far as Not Being <i>is</i> 
potentially, though not actually, it is knowable by man,
and still more by God.  In fact the proper objects of
abstract science <i>are</i> in this potential and ideal order, 
of which the actual furnishes illustrations. Cf. Plato,
<i>Rep.</i> VII, 529 C.D. As St Thomas says presently:
"Our mind could grasp the ideal essence of a lion or a
horse, even though all such animals were destroyed."
