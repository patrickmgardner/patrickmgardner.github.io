"As the various organs of the body have no
function, and therefore no real existence apart from
the living body, so particular good things (virtue,
health, beauty, wealth) have no existence, except as
elements of the noble life.  The Idea of the Good
is the unity of good things, and that by reason of
which they are good, -- that definite system of order,
by belonging to, and observing which, particular
things are said to be <i>good</i>, rather than pleasant, or
otherwise attractive to mere sense . . . . <b>Nous</b> in man,
like <b>phusis</b> in the plant and animal worlds, recognises
and imposes definite limits. Particular details are valued
by it, not for themselves (for if they were, no limit
could be assigned to their desirable multiplication)
but for the sake of the beautiful Life which transforms 
them." -- Professor J. A. Stewart, <i>Notes on the
Nicomachean Ethics</i>, Vol. I, p. 96, ed. 1892.
