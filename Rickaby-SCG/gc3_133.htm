<H1>Of various Modes of Living adopted by the Votaries of 
Voluntary Poverty</h1>

FIRST MODE. The first mode is for the possessions of all to be sold, 
and all to live in common on [the capital fund accumulated by] the 
price, as was done under the Apostles at Jerusalem: <i>As many as had 
possessions in lands or houses sold them, and laid the price at the 
feet of the Apostles, and division was made to each according to the 
need of each</i> (Acts iv, 34, 35).<p> 

<i>Criticism</i>. It is not easy to induce many men with great 
possessions to take up this mode of life; and if the amount realised 
out of the possessions of a few rich is divided among many recipients, 
it will not last long.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. This mode will do, but not for a long time. And therefore 
we do not read of the Apostles instituting this inode of living when 
they passed to the nations among whom the Church was to take root and 
endure.<p> 

Second Mode. To have possessions in common, sufficient to provide for
all members of the community out of what the property brings in, as is
done in most monasteries.<p>

<i>Criticism</i>. Earthly possessions breed solicitude, as well for the 
gathering in of the returns as also for the defence of them against 
acts of fraud and violence; and this solicitude is all the greater as 
greater possessions are required for the support of many. In this way 
then the end of voluntary poverty is defeated, at least in the case of 
many, who have the procuratorship of these possessions. Besides, common 
possession is wont to be a source of discord.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. The administration of these common possessions may be 
left to the care of one or a few persons, and the rest remain without 
solicitude for temporals, free to attend to spiritual things. Nor do 
they who undertake this solicitude for others lose any of the 
perfection of their life: for what they seem to lose by defect of 
quiet they recover in the service of charity, in which perfection 
consists. Nor is there any loss of concord by occasion of this mode of 
common possessions. For they who adopt voluntary poverty ought to be 
persons who despise temporal things; and such persons are not the men 
to quarrel over temporals.<p> 

Third mode. To live by the labour of one's hands, as St Paul did and 
advised others to do. <i>We have not eaten bread of any one for 
nothing, but in labour and fatigue, night and day working, not to be a 
burden to any of you: not that we had not authority to act otherwise, 
but to present ourselves to you as a model for you to imitate: for when 
we were with you, we laid down to you the rule, if any man not work, 
neither let him eat</i> (2 Thess. iii, 8-10).<p> 

<i>Criticism</i>. It seems folly for one to abandon what is necessary, 
and afterwards try to get it back again by labour. Moreover, whereas 
the end of the counsel of voluntary poverty is the readier following of 
Christ in freedom from worldly solicitudes, earning one's livelihood by 
one's own labour is a matter of more anxiety than living on the 
possessions which one had before, especially if they were a modest 
competency. And the Lord seems to forbid manual labour to His disciples 
in the text: <i>Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither 
do they reap: consider the lilies of the field how they grow, they 
labour not, neither do they spin</i> (Matt. vi, 26, 28). Moreover this 
mode of living is inadequate. Many desire a perfect life, who have not 
the capacity for earning their livelihood by labour, not having been 
brought up thereto: also there is the possibility of sickness. And no 
little time must be spent in labour to suffice for earning a 
livelihood: many spend their whole time in labour, and yet can scarcely 
live. Thus the votaries of voluntary poverty will be hindered from 
study and spiritual exercises; and their poverty will be more of a 
hindrance than a help to the perfection of their life.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. In the case of rich men, their possessions involve 
solicitude in getting them or keeping them; and the heart of the owner 
is drawn to them; inconveniences which do not happen to one whose sole 
object is to gain his daily bread by the labour of his hands. Little 
time is sufficient, and little solicitude is necessary, for gaining by 
the labour of one's hands enough to support nature: but for gathering 
riches and superfluities, as craftsmen in the world propose, much time 
has to be spent and much solicitude shown. Our Lord in the Gospel has 
not forbidden labour of the hands, but anxiety of mind about the 
necessaries of life. He did not say, <i>Do not labour</i>, but, <i>Be 
not solicitous</i>. And this precept He enforces by an argument from 
less to greater. For if divine providence sustains birds and lilies, 
which are of inferior condition, and cannot labour at those works 
whereby men get their livelihood, much more will it provide for men, 
who are of worthier condition, and to whom it has given ability to win 
their livelihood by their own labours. It is the exception for a man 
not to be able to win enough to live upon by the labour of his hands; 
and an institution is not to be rejected for exceptional cases.  The 
remedy is, for him whose labour is not enough to keep him, to be helped 
out either by others of the same society, who can make more by their 
labour than is necessary for them, or by others who are well off. Nor 
need those who are content with little spend much time in seeking a 
livelihood by the labour of their hands: so they are not much hindered 
from spiritual works, especially  as in working with  their hands they 
can think of God and praise Him.<p> 

Fourth mode. To live on the alms contributed by others, who retain 
their wealth. This seems to have been the method observed by our Lord: 
for it is said that sundry women followed Christ, and <i>ministered to 
him out of their means</i> (Luke viii, 2, 3).<p> 

<i>Criticism</i>. It seems irrational for one to abandon his own and 
live on an other's property, -- or for one to receive of another and 
pay him back nothing in return. There is no impropriety in ministers of 
the altar and preachers, to whom the people are indebted for doctrine 
and other divine gifts, receiving support at their hands: <i>for the 
labourer is worthy of his hire</i>, as the Lord says (Matt. x, 10); and 
the Apostle, <i>the Lord hath ordained that they who preach the gospel 
should live by the gospel</i> (1 Cor. ix, 14). But it is an apparent 
absurdity for these persons who minister to the people in no office to 
receive the necessaries of life from the people. Others moreover, who 
through sickness and poverty cannot help themselves, must lose their 
alms through these professors of voluntary poverty, since men neither 
can nor will succour a great multitude of poor. Moreover independence 
of spirit is particularly requisite for perfect virtue: otherwise men 
easily become partakers in other people's sins, either by expressly 
consenting to them, or by palliating or dissembling them. But this 
method of life is a great drawback to such independence, for a man 
cannot but shrink from offending one by whose patronage he lives. 
Moreover the necessity of exposing one's necessities to others, and 
begging relief, renders mendicants objects of contempt and dislike, 
whereas persons who take up a perfect life ought to be reverenced and 
loved. But if any one will praise the practice of begging as conducive 
to humility, he seems to talk altogether unreasonably. For the praise 
of humility consists in despising earthly exaltation, such as comes of 
riches, honours, fame, but not in despising loftiness of virtue, for 
in that respect we ought to be magnanimous. That then would be a 
blameworthy humility, for the sake of which any one should do anything 
derogatory to loftiness of virtue. But the practice of begging is so 
derogatory, as well because it is more virtuous to give than to 
receive, as also because there is a look of filthy lucre about it.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. There is no impropriety in him being supported by the 
alms of others, who has abandoned his own possessions for the sake of 
something that turns to the profit of others. Were this not so, human 
society could not go on. If every one busied himself only about his own 
affairs, there would be no one to minister to the general advantage. 
The best thing then for human society (<i>hominum societati</i>) is 
that they who neglect the care of their own interests to serve the 
general advantage, should be supported by those whose advantage they 
serve. Therefore do soldiers live on pay provided by others, and civil 
rulers are provided for out of the common fund. But they who embrace 
voluntary poverty to follow Christ, certainly abandon what they have to 
serve the common advantage, enlightening the people by wisdom, learning 
and example, or sustaining them by their prayer and intercession. Hence 
there is nothing base in their living on what they get from others, 
seeing that they make a greater return, receiving temporals and helping 
others in spirituals. Hence the Apostle says: <i>Let your abundance in 
temporals supply their want, that their abundance</i> in spirituals 
<i>also may supply your want</i> (2 Cor. viii, 14: cf. Rom. xv, 27). 
For he who abets another becomes a partner in his work, whether for 
good or evil. By their example other men become less attached to 
riches, seeing them abandon riches altogether for the sake of 
perfection. And the less one loves riches, the more ready will he be to 
make distribution of his riches in other's need: hence they who embrace 
voluntary poverty are useful to other poor people, provoking the rich 
to works of mercy by word and example. Nor do they lose their liberty 
of spirit for the little they receive from others for their sustenance. 
A man does not lose his independence except for things that become 
predominant in his affections: for things that a man despises, if they 
are given to him, he does not lose his liberty. Nor is there any 
unseemliness in their exposing their necessities, and asking what they 
need either for themselves or others. The Apostles are read to have 
done so (2 Cor. viii, ix). Such begging does not render men 
contemptible, if it is done moderately, for necessaries, not for 
superfluities, without importunity, and with due regard to the 
conditions of the persons asked, and place and time. There is no shadow 
of disgrace about such begging, though there would be, if it were done 
with importunity or without discretion.<p> 

There is, no doubt, a certain humiliation in begging, as having a thing 
done to you is less honourable than doing it, and receiving than 
giving, and obeying royal power than governing and reigning. The 
spontaneous embracing of humiliations is a practice of humility, not 
in any and every case, but when it is done for a needful purpose: for 
humility, being a virtue, does nothing indiscreetly. It is then not 
humility but folly to embrace any and every humiliation: but where 
virtue calls for a thing to be done, it belongs to humility not to 
shrink from doing it for the humiliation that goes with it, for 
instance, not to refuse some mean service where charity calls upon 
you so to help your neighbour. Thus then where begging is requisite for 
the perfection of a life of poverty, it is a point of humility to bear 
this humiliation. Sometimes too, even where our own duty does not 
require us to embrace humiliations, it is an act of virtue to take them 
up in order to encourage others by our example more easily to bear 
what is incumbent on them: for a general sometimes will do the 
office of a common soldier to encourage the rest. Sometimes again we 
may make a virtuous use of humiliations as a medicine. Thus if any 
one's mind is prone to undue self-exaltation, he may with advantage 
make a moderate use of humiliations, either self-imposed or imposed 
by others, so to check the elation of his spirit by putting himself on 
a level with the lowest class of the community in the doing of mean 
offices.<p> 

Fifth mode. There have also been some who said that the votaries of a 
perfect life should take no thought either for begging or labouring or 
laying up anything for themselves, but should exped their sustenance 
from God alone, according to the texts, <i>Be not solicitous</i>, and, 
<i>Take no thought for the morrow</i> (Matt. vi, 25, 34).<p> 

<i>Criticism</i>. This seems quite an irrational proceeding. For it is 
foolish to wish an end and omit the means ordained to that end. Now to 
the end of eating there is ordained some human care of providing 
oneself with food. They then who cannot live without eating ought to 
have some solicitude about seeking their food. There follows also a 
strange absurdity: for by parity of reasoning one might say that he 
will not walk, or open his mouth to eat, or avoid a stone falling, or a 
sword striking him, but expect God to do all, which is tantamount to 
tempting God.<A HREF="gc3_133a.htm">*</a><p>

<i>Reply</i>. It is quite an irrational error to suppose that all 
solicitude about making a livelihood is forbidden by the Lord. Every 
action requires care: if then a man ought to have no solicitude about 
temporal things, it follows that he should do nothing temporal, which 
is neither a possible nor a reasonable course. For God has prescribed 
to every being actions according to the peculiarity of its nature. Man, 
being made up of a nature at once spiritual and corporeal, must by 
divine ordinance exercise bodily actions; and at the same time have 
spiritual aims; and he is the more perfect, the more spiritual his aims 
are. But it is not a mode of perfection proper to man to omit bodily 
action: bodily actions serve necessary purposes in the preservation of 
life; and whoever omits them neglects his life, which he is bound to 
preserve. To look for aid from God in matters in which one can help 
oneself by one's own action, and so to leave that action out, is a 
piece of folly and a tempting of God: for it is proper to the divine 
goodness to provide for things, not immediately by doing everything 
itself, but by moving other things to their own proper action (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_77.htm">LXXVII</a>). We must not then omit the means of 
helping ourselves, and expect God to help us in defect of all action of 
our own: that is inconsistent with the divine ordinance and with His 
goodness.<p> 

But because, though it rests with us to act, still that our actions 
shall attain their due end does not rest with us, owing to obstacles 
that may arise, the success that each one shall have in his action 
comes under divine arrangement. The Lord then lays it down that we 
ought not to be solicitous for what does not belong to us, that is, for 
the success of our actions: but He has not forbidden us to be 
solicitous about what does belong to us, that is, for the work which we 
ourselves do. It is not then to act against the precept of the Lord, to 
feel solicitude for the things which have to be done; but he goes 
against the precept, who is solicitous for what may turn out even when 
(<i>etiam si</i>) he does all that is in his power to do, and takes due 
precautions beforehand (<i>praemittat</i>) to meet the contingency of 
such untoward events.<p> 

When that is done, we ought to hope in God's providence, by whom even 
the birds and herbs are sustained.<A HREF="gc3_133b.htm">*</a> To feel 
solicitude on such points seems to appertain to the error of the 
Gentiles who deny divine providence. Therefore the Lord concludes that 
we should <i>take no thought for the morrow</i> (Matt. vi, 34), by 
which He has not forbidden us to lay up betimes things needful for the 
morrow; but He forbids that solicitude about future events which goes 
with a sort of despair of the divine assistance, as also the allowing 
of the solicitude that will have to be entertained to-morrow to come in 
before its time perversely to-day:<A HREF="gc3_133c.htm">*</a> for 
every day brings its own solicitude; hence it is added, <i>Sufficient 
for the day is the evil thereof</i>.
