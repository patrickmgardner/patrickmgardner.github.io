<H1>That Sins are punished also by the experience of something 
Painful</h1>

PUNISHMENT ought to be proportionate to the fault. But in a fault not 
only is there an aversion of the mind from the last end, but also an 
undue conversion of it to other objects as ends. Not only then should 
the sinner be punished by exclusion from the end, but also by other 
things turning to his pain.<p> 

2. No one is afraid to lose what he does not desire to gain. They then 
who have their will turned away from their last end, have no fear of 
being shut out from it. Consequently that mere exclusion would not be 
enough to call them off from sinning. Some other punishment then must 
be employed, which sinners may fear.<p> 

3. One who puts to undue use the means to a certain end, not only is 
deprived of the end, but incurs some other hurt besides. Thus 
inordinate taking of food not only does not bring health, but further 
induces sickness. But whoever sets up his rest in creatures does not 
use them as he ought: he does not refer them to their last end. Not 
only then ought he to be punished by going without happiness, but also 
by experiencing some pain from creatures.<p> 

Hence divine Scripture not only threatens sinners with exclusion from 
glory, but also with affliction in other ways. <i>Depart from me, ye 
cursed, into everlasting fire</i> (Matt. xxv, 41). <i>He shall rain nets on 
sinners: fire and brimstone and the breath of stormy winds shall be 
the portion of their cup</i> (Ps. x, 7).<A HREF="gc3_146a.htm">*</a>
