<H1>That God is Universal Perfection</h1>

AS all perfection and nobility is in a thing inasmuch as the thing is,
so every defect is in a thing inasmuch as the thing in some manner
is not. As then God has being in its totality, so not-being is totally
removed from Him, because the measure in which a thing has being is the
measure of its removal from not-being. Therefore all defect is absent from
God: He is therefore universal perfection.<P>

2. Everything imperfect must proceed from something perfect: therefore
the First Being must be most perfect.<P>

3. Everything is perfect inasmuch as it is in actuality; imperfect, 
inasmuch as it is in potentiality, with privation of actuality. That then which
is nowise in potentiality, but is pure actuality, must be most perfect; and
such is God.<A HREF="gc1_28a.htm">*</a><P>

4. Nothing acts except inasmuch as it is in actuality: action therefore
follows the measure of actuality in the agent. It is impossible therefore for
any effect that is brought into being by action to be of a nobler actuality
than is the actuality of the agent. It is possible though for the actuality of 
the effect to be less perfect than the actuality of the acting cause, inasmuch
as action may be weakened on the part of the object to which it is terminated, 
or upon which it is spent. Now in the category of efficient causation
everything is reducible ultimately to one cause, which is God, of whom are
all things. Everything therefore that actually is in any other thing must 
be found in God much more eminently than in the thing itself; God then is 
most perfect.<P>

Hence the answer given to Moses by the Lord, when he sought to see 
the divine face or glory: <i>I will show thee all good</i> (Exod. 
xxxiii, 19).
