<H1>That Divine Providence is not inconsistent with Freedom of the 
Will</h1>

THE government of every prudent governor is ordained to the perfection 
of the things governed, to the gaining, or increasing, of maintenance 
of that perfection. An element of perfection then is more worthy of 
being preserved by providence than an element of imperfection and 
defect. But in inanimate things the contingency of causes comes of 
imperfection and defect: for by their nature they are determined to one 
effect, which they always gain, unless there be some let or hindrance 
arising either from limitation of power, or the interference of some 
external agent, or indisposition of subject-matter; and on this account 
natural causes in their action are not indifferent to either side of an 
alternative, but for the most part produce their effects uniformly, 
while they fail in a minority of instances. But that the will is a 
contingent cause comes of its very perfection, because its power is not 
tied to one effect, but it rests with it to produce this effect or 
that, wherefore it is contingent either way. <A HREF="gc3_73a.htm">*</a> 
Therefore providence is more concerned to preserve the liberty of the 
will than to preserve contingency in natural causes.<p> 

2. It belongs to divine providence to use things according to their 
several modes. But a thing's mode of action depends upon its form, 
which is the principle of action. But the form whereby a voluntary 
agent acts is not determinate: for the will acts through a form 
apprehended by the intellect; and the intellect has not one determined 
form of effect under its consideration, but essentially embraces a 
multitude of forms;<A HREF="gc3_73b.htm">*</a> and therefore the will 
can produce multiform effects.<p> 

3. The last end of every creature is to attain to a likeness to God 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc3_17.htm">XVII</a>): therefore it would be contrary 
to providence to withdraw from a creature that whereby it attains the 
divine likeness. But a voluntary agent attains the divine likeness by 
acting freely, as it has been shown that there is free will in God (B. 
I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_88.htm">LXXXVIII</a>).<p> 

4. Providence tends to multiply good things in the subjects of its 
government. But if free will were taken away, many good things would 
be withdrawn. The praise of human virtue would be taken away, which is 
nullified where good is not done freely: the justice of rewards and 
punishments would be taken away, if man did not do good and evil 
freely: wariness and circumspection in counsel would be taken away, as 
there would be no need of taking counsel about things done under 
necessity. It would be therefore contrary to the plan of providence to 
withdraw the liberty of the will.<A HREF="gc3_73c.htm">*</a><p> 

Hence it is said: <i>God made man from the beginning, and left him in 
the hand of his own counsel: before man is life and death, whatever 
he shall please shall be given him</i> (Ecclus xv, 14-17).<p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of the Stoics, who said that all things 
arose of necessity, according to an indefeasible order, which the 
Greeks called <i>ymarmene</i> (<b>heimarmen&ecirc;</b>).
