<H1>That the main purpose of the Divine Law is to subordinate Man to 
God</h1>

THE end which God intends is Himself.<p>

2. The end of every human creature is to adhere to God, for in
that his happiness consists.<p>

4. That should be the main purpose of a law, from which the law derives 
its efficacy. But the law given by God has efficacy among men from the 
fact that man is suited to God. This therefore ought to be the chief 
precept in the divine law, that the human mind should adhere to God.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God ask of
thee but that thou fear the Lord thy God and walk in his ways, and 
love him and serve the Lord thy God with thy whole heart and thy 
whole soul?</i> (Deut. x, 12.)
