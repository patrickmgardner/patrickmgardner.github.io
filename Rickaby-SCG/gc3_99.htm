<H1>God can work beyond the Order laid down for Creatures, and produce 
Effects without Proximate Causes</h1>

SINCE accidents follow upon the substantial principles of the thing, he 
who immediately produces the substance of a thing must be able 
immediately to work in the thing whatever effects follow upon substantial 
existence. But God by creation has brought all things immediately into 
being. He can therefore immediately move anything to any effect without 
intermediate causes.<A HREF="gc3_99a.htm">*</a><p> 

But if any one says that, once God has fixed an orderly course of 
events, He cannot change it without changing Himself; and that He would 
change Himself, if ever He worked in the world to the production of 
effects apart from their own proper causes, such a saying may be 
refuted by a study of nature. For the orderly course of events fixed by 
God, if we look at it as it obtains in creation, will be found to hold 
for the most part, but not everywhere or always:<A 
HREF="gc3_99b.htm">*</a> for sometimes, although in a minority of 
cases, the thing turns out otherwise, either for lack of power in the 
agent, or for indisposition of the matter, or from some <i>vis 
major</i> supervening. Yet not on that account does the law of 
providence <A HREF="gc3_99c.htm">*</a> fail or suffer change: for it 
comes under providence that the natural course of things, instituted to 
hold usually,<A HREF="gc3_99d.htm">*</a> should sometimes fail. If 
therefore by the action of some created power the natural course of 
events may be altered from the usual to the unusual, and that without 
any alteration of divine providence, much more may the divine power 
sometimes do a thing, without prejudice to its own providence, beyond 
the course assigned to natural events by God. This God does at times to 
manifest His power: for there is no better way of manifesting the 
subjection of all nature to the divine will than by something being 
done at times beyond the course of nature: for thereby it appears that 
the course of events proceeds from Him, and is not of necessity of 
nature, but through free will.<A HREF="gc3_99e.htm">*</a>  Nor should 
this be accounted a frivolous reason to allege, that God works some 
effects in nature to the end of manifesting Himself to human minds, 
since it has been shown that all the material creation is subordinated 
to serve the end of intellectual nature, while the end of intellectual 
nature itself is the knowledge of God. No wonder then if some change is 
wrought in corporeal substance to afford intelligent nature a knowledge 
of God.
