<H1>That the Predication of many Relations of God is no prejudice to 
the Simplicity and Singleness of His Being</h1> 

It is no prejudice to the simplicity of God's being that many relations 
are predicated of Him, not as denoting anything affecting His essence, 
but according to our mode of thought. For our mind, understanding many 
things, may very well be related in manifold ways to a being that is in 
itself simple; and so it comes to view that simple being under manifold 
relations. Indeed the more simple anything is, the greater is its 
power, and the more numerous the effects whereof it is the principle; 
and thus it is viewed as coming into relation in more manifold ways. 
The fact then that many things are predicated of God relatively is an 
attestation of the supreme simplicity and singleness of His being.<p>
