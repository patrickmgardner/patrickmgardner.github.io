According to Aristotle, <i>Politics</i>, i, 9, whatever
we desire as a final end, and not merely as a means,
we desire without end or measure. Thus to desire
wealth is to make a god of Mammon, as some do of
pleasure (Matt. vi, 24: Phil. iii, 18), and consequently 
to stick at nothing that can safely procure it:
it is to be the slave of money. Cf. St Paul's expressions, 
Rom. vi, 16-20, and the phrase in Thucydides
i, 81, <b>douleuein t&ecirc; g&ecirc;</b> 'to be the slaves of one's land,'
i.e., to be ready to make any unpatriotic sacrifice to
save one's estates.<p>
