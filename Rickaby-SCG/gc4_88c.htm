The reference is to 1 Thess. iv, 17, where however 
the subject is not 'the risen,' but <i>we who live,
who are left behind</i>, who seem to be contrasted with
'the risen ' in the previous verse 16, as also in 1 Cor.
xv, 51 (Greek): 2 Cor. v, 4. Really this 1 Thess.
iv, 17, is not a parallel passage to Eph. iv, 13. From
what the Apostle says in the latter passage we are led
to hope that the divisions of Christendom may one
day be healed, and the imperfect faith of so many
good men may be made perfect in Catholic unity;
but the text has no immediate bearing on the resurrection 
of the body. The schoolmen are not at their best in exegesis.
