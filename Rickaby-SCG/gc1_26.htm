<H1>That God is not the formal or abstract being of all things</h1>

THINGS are not distinguished from one another in so far as they all 
have being, because in this they all agree. If therefore things do 
differ from one another, either 'being' itself must be specified by 
certain added differentias, so that different things have a different 
specific being; or things must differ in this that 'being' itself 
attaches to specifically different natures. The first alternative is 
impossible, because no addition can be made to 'being,' in the way that 
differentia is added to genus, as has been said (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_25.htm">XXV</a>, n. 4). It remains therefore that 
things differ in that they have different natures, to which 'being' 
accrues differently. But the divine being is not something accessory to 
any nature, but is the very nature or essence of God (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_22.htm">XXII</a>). If therefore the divine being were 
the formal and abstract being of all things, all things would have to 
be absolutely one.<A HREF="gc1_26a.htm">*</a><P> 

4. What is common to many is not anything over and above the many 
except in thought alone. For example, 'animal' is not anything over and 
above Socrates and Plato and other animals, except in the mind that 
apprehends the form of 'animal' despoiled of all individualising and 
specifying marks: for what is really animal is man: otherwise it would 
follow that in Plato there were several animals, to wit, animal in 
general, and man in general, and Plato himself.  Much less then is bare 
being in general anything over and above all existing things, except in 
the mind alone. If then God be being in general, God will be nothing 
more than a logical entity, something that exists in the mind alone.<P> 

This error is set aside by the teaching of Holy Scripture, which 
confesses God <i>lofty and high</i> (Isa. vi, 1), and that He is 
<i>above all</i> (Rom. ix, 5).  For if He is the being of all, then He 
is something of all, not above all. The supporters of this error are 
also cast out by the same sentence which casts out idolaters, who gave 
<i>the incommunicable name</i> of God to stocks and stones (Wisd. xiv, 
8, 21).  For if God were the being of all, it would not be more truly 
said, 'A stone is a being,' than 'A stone is God.'<P> 

What has led men into this error is a piece of faulty reasoning. For, 
seeing that what is common to many is specialised and individualised by 
addition, they reckoned that the divine being, to which no addition is 
made, was not any individual being, but was the general being of all 
things: failing to observe that what is common or universal cannot 
really exist without addition, but merely is viewed by the mind without 
addition. 'Animal' cannot be without 'rational' or 'irrational' as a 
differentia, although it may be thought of without these 
differentias.<A HREF="gc1_26b.htm">*</a> Moreover, though the universal 
be thought of without addition, yet not without susceptibility of 
addition. 'Animal' would not be a genus if no differentia could be 
added to it; and so of other generic names. But the divine being is 
without addition, not only in thought, but also <i>in rerum natura</i>; and 
not only without addition, but without even susceptibility of addition. 
Hence from this very fact, that He neither receives nor can receive 
addition, we may rather conclude that God is not being in general, but 
individual being: for by this very fact His being is distinguished from 
all other beings, that nothing can be added to it. (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_24.htm">XXIV</a>).
