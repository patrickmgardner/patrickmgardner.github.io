If it is good for one man to blow a horn, it
would be a good thing for the whole population to
turn horn-blowers. -- This precious style of argument,
by no means an uncommon style, assumes that you
cannot have too much of a good thing; which is true
of faith, hope, and charity, and of all ends, as such
but never means (notes, pp. 290, 299, 305).
Celibacy, like poverty, is not an end in itself.
