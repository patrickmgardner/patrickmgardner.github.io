Here is a definition carefully to note. 'Original justice,' 
according to St Thomas, is the perfect subjection of man's lower powers 
to his reason, of his reason to God, and of his body to his soul.' He 
marks off 'grace,' i.e., sanctifying grace, from 
'original justice.' ' Original justice then implies freedom from 
concupiscence, from folly, and from bodily weakness and incapacity of 
all sorts. A man in original justice would have no difficulty in 
banishing from his mind thoughts that he recognised as foolish and 
undesirable. He would have absolute control over his emotions and 
passions.
