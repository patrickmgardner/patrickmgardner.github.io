<H1>That the Divine Will does not take away Contingency from things<a 
href="gc1_85a.htm"*</a></h1>

HYPOTHETICAL necessity in the cause cannot lead to absolute necessity 
in the effect. But God's will about a creature is not absolutely 
necessary, but hypothetically so (Chap. <a href="gc1_83.htm">LXXXIII</a>). 
Therefore the divine will is no argument of absolute necessity in 
creatures.  But only this absolute necessity excludes contingency: for 
even a contingent fact may be extended either way into an hypothetical 
necessity: thus it is necessary that Socrates moves, if he runs.  It 
does not therefore follow that a thing happens of necessity, if God 
wills it: all that holds is the necessary truth of this conditional: 
'If God wills anything, the thing will be': but the 'consequent' (as 
distinguished from the 'consequence') need not be a necessary truth.<a
