<H1>That the End of the Divine Law is the Love of God</h1>

THE main intention of the divine law is that man should adhere to God; 
and man adheres to God chiefly by love.  There are two powers whereby 
man may cleave to God, his understanding and his will. By the lower 
faculties of his soul man cannot cleave to God, but adheres to lower 
things. Now the adhesion that is of the understanding is completed by 
that which is of the will: for by the will man comes to rest in what 
the understanding apprehends. The will cleaves to a thing either 
through love or through fear, but in different ways. When it adheres to 
a thing through fear, it adheres for the sake of something else, 
namely, to avoid an evil threatening it, if it does not adhere: but 
when it adheres to a thing through love, it adheres for the thing's own 
sake. But what is for its own sake carries the day over what is only 
for the sake of something else. Therefore the adhesion of love to God 
is the chief way of adhering to Him, and is the point principally 
intended in the divine law.<p> 

2. The end of every law, and particularly of the divine law, is to make 
men good. Now a man is called good from having a good will: for the 
will it is which reduces to act whatever good there is in the man: but 
the will is good by willing good, and particularly the chief good, 
which is the end: the more then the will wills this good, the better 
the man is. Therefore the will of the sovereign good, which is God, is 
what most of all makes men good, and is principally intended in the 
divine law.<p> 

3. The law aims at making men virtuous: but it is a condition of virtue 
that the virtuous person should act firmly and with pleasure; and love 
it is that best makes us do a thing firmly and with delight.<p> 

Therefore it is said: <i>The end of the commandment is charity</i> (1 
Tim. i, 5): <i>The greatest and first commandment is, Thou shalt love the 
Lord thy God</i> (Matt. xxii, 37, 38).
