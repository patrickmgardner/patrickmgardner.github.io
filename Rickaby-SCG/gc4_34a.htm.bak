The great feature in the theology of the fourth
and fifth centuries was the opposition between the
school of Alexandria, allegorical, mystical, Oriental,
and the school of Antioch, matter-of-fact, literal,
accurate, Western-minded. There were Saints and
Doctors of both schools, and heretics in both, the
latter carrying the tendencies of their respective
schools to excess. From Alexandria came Origen,
Athanasius, Cyril, Arius, Apollinaris, Dioscorus.
From Antioch, John Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theodore 
of Mopsuestia, Nestorius. Theodore in his
early career was a friend of St John Chrysostom,
who addressed to him the still extant treatise, <i>Ad
Theodorum lapsum</i>, against the forsaking of monastic
life. He was a priest with Chrysostom at Antioch,
then in 392 bishop of Mopsuestia (<b>Mopsou hestia</b>) in
Cilicia, and died in his bishopric in 428, three years
before the Council of Ephesus. Theodore was a
voluminous writer and biblical commentator, fond
of the literal sense, hating allegories. He was a 
vigorous opponent of Arius, and especially of Apollinaris.
On the other hand, he countenanced the Pelagians,
and wrote against St Jerome and St Augustine. Theodore, 
like Bishop Jansenius of Ypres, enjoyed the
reputation of orthodoxy all his life, and died in the
peace of the Church. As the Jansenists took up
the book of Jansenius, drew their heresy from it,
and involved themselves and it in a final condemnation; 
so the Nestorians fell back upon Theodore, the
protagonist of the Antiochene school. Thus Theodore
and his works came to be condemned in the fifth
General Council, the second of Constantinople in
553. Since their condemnation, the greater part of
them have perished.<p>

Nestorius, a Syrian, educated at Antioch, became
bishop of Constantinople in 428, the year of Theodore's 
death. He was condemned and deposed in the
Council of Ephesus in 431. Nestorianism is the most
rationalistic, and in that way the acutest, of all
heretical perversions of the Incarnation. At this day,
east and west, beyond the visible pale of the Catholic 
Church, thousands of professing Christians are,
consciously or unconsciously, Nestorians.
