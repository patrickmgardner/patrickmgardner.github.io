<i>In spiritu praedicto</i>, which I render 'in the aforesaid subject': 
because the <i>spiritus</i>, <b>pneuma</b>, or 'gas' that made 
according to Aristotle <b>to en t&ocirc; spermati aphr&ocirc;des te kai 
leukon</b>, has been declared by St Thomas to be the 'proper subject' 
in which the 'formative power' inheres. <i>Spiritus</i> was a vague 
word to a mediaeval writer: it was fraught with suggestions high and 
divine. St Thomas would have shrunk from reducing <i>spiritus</i>, to 
the mysterious vehicle of the <i>vis formativa seminis</i>, to the 
banality of <i>gas</i>. But the <b>pneuma</b> of <i>De gen. 
animal.</i>, II, ii, the authority on which he relied, is gas pure and 
simple.<p>

As a piece of morphology, all this speculation about <b>pneuma, 
aphros,</b> <i>spiritus, spuma,</i> gas and foam, must be swept away. 
It is false, as we have seen the analogy of a bisected Annelid to be 
false. The cutting of a worm in two is no example of the generative 
process; and there is no such thing in any <i>semen</i> as this genetic 
gas. Chemical and microscopic examination of the mammalian 
<i>semen</i> reveal quite another structure and composition.<p>

So far as biology sees it, what actually happens in conception is this: 
-- "Wherever they meet the female ovum, the male spermatozoa surround 
it, often in dense masses. Only one spermatozoon however effects an 
entrance into the ovum, after the following fashion. The tail is left 
behind, and the nucleated head with the centrosome passes into the ovum, 
generally as a place called the 'micropyle.' Certain changes have been 
going on in the ovum to anticipate this event, and the renewed nucleus 
of the ovum is awaiting developments. This is known as the 'female 
pronucleus.' Certain changes prepare the nucleated head of the 
spermatozoon for action, and what is known as the 'male pronucleus' 
results. The male pronucleus proceeds to fuse with the female 
pronucleus, and a new nucleus, the result of the combination, the 
'segmentation nucleus' results. Thus the male element and the female 
element seem to take an equal part in the formation of the embryo: for 
immediately after the combined nucleus is formed, the work of 
segmentation and formation of the tissues goes on. Though 
fertilisation is effected by quite a microscopic quantity, one single 
spermatozoon entering the ovum, we must observe that an equally 
microscopic part of the ovum is fertilised: for the great bulk of what 
we call the ovum is made up of nutritive material, food-yolk, etc."<p>

So far, so clear, much in advance of St Thomas. But concerning any 
<i>vis formativa</i>, directrix of this wonderful process of conception 
and development; and about the origin and function of soul, vegetative, 
sentient, and intelligent; we remain shrouded in the darkness of the 
thirteenth century. We want a new treatise <i>De anima</i>, to be 
written by some <i>Aquinas modernus</i>, who shall be at once a 
profound Aristotelian and an expert biologist, and shall consecrate his 
life to this one study of soul. He should not neglect the mistaken 
biology of the original Aquinas and Aristotle. The mistakes of great 
minds are suggestive: they are far-reaching in the history of thought. 
Thus, as one reads Aristotle, <i>De gen. animal.</i>, II, ii, the 
memory is carried to St John's Gospel, iii, 5; vi, 63; and his first 
Epistle, v, 8: <b>ean m&ecirc; tis genn&ecirc;th&ecirc; ex hudatos kai 
pneumatos -- to pneuma esti to z&ocirc;opoioun -- to pneuma kai to 
hud&ocirc;r kai to haima</b>.
