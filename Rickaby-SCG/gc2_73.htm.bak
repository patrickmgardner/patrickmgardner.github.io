<H1>That the Potential Intellect is not One and the Same in all Men</h1>

HENCE it is plainly shown that there is not one and the same potential 
intellect, belonging to all men who are and who shall be and who have 
been, as Averroes pretends.<a href="gc2_73a.htm">*</a><p> 

A.1. It has been shown that the substance of the intellect is united 
with the human body and is its form (Chap. <a 
href="gc2_57.htm">LVII</a>). But it is impossible for there to be one 
form otherwise than of one matter. Therefore there is not one intellect 
for all men.<p> 

A.2 and 3.<a href="gc2_73b.htm">*</a> It is not possible for a dog's 
soul to enter a wolf's body, or a man's soul any other body than the 
body of a man. But the same proportion that holds between a man's soul 
and a man's body, holds between the soul of this man and the body of 
this man. It is impossible therefore for the soul of this man to enter 
any other body than the body of this man. But it is by the soul of this 
man that this man understands. Therefore there is not one and the same 
intellect of this man and of that.<p> 

A.4. A thing has being from that source from whence it has unity: for 
one and being are inseparable. But everything has being by its own 
form. Therefore the unity of the thing follows the unity of the form. 
It is impossible therefore for there to be one form of different 
individual men. But the form of any individual man is his intellectual 
soul. It is impossible therefore for there to be one intellect of all 
men.<p> 

But if it is said that the sentient soul of this man is other than the 
sentient soul of that, and so far forth the two are not one man, though 
there be one intellect of both, such explanation cannot stand. For the 
proper activity of every being follows upon and is indicative of its 
species. But as the proper activity of an animal is to feel, so the 
proper activity of a man is to understand. As any given individual is an 
animal in that he has feeling, so is he a man by virtue of the faculty 
whereby he understands. But the faculty whereby the soul understands, 
or the man through the soul, is the potential intellect. This 
individual then is a man by the potential intellect. If then this man 
has another sentient soul than another man, but not another potential 
intellect, but one and the same, it follows that they are two animals, 
but not two men.<p> 

B. To these arguments the Commentator replies by saying that the 
potential intellect is conjoined with us through its own form, namely, 
through an intelligible impression, one subject of which [is the said 
potential intellect, and one subject again] is the phantasm existing in 
us, which differs in different men; and thus the potential intellect is 
multiplied in different men, not by reason of its substance, but by 
reason of its form.<p> 

The nullity of this reply appears by what has been shown above (Chap. 
<a href="gc2_59.htm">LIX</a>), that it would be impossible for any man to have 
understanding, if this were the only way in which the potential intellect were 
conjoined with us. But suppose that the aforesaid conjunction 
(<i>continuatio</i>) were sufficient to render man intelligent, still 
the said answer does not solve the arguments already alleged.<p> 

B.1. According to the above exposition, nothing belonging to intellect 
will remain multiplied as men are multiplied except only the phantasm, 
or impression in phantasy; and this very phantasm will not be 
multiplied as it is actually understood, because, as so understood, it 
is in the potential intellect, and has undergone abstraction of 
material conditions under the operation of the active intellect; 
whereas the phantasm, as a potential term of intelligence, does not 
transcend the grade of the sentient soul.<p> 

B.2. Still the objection holds, that this man will not be 
differentiated from that except by the sentient soul; and the awkward 
consequence follows that this man and that together do not make a 
plurality of men.<p> 

B.3. Nothing attains its species by what it is potentially, but by what 
it is actually.<a href="gc2_73c.htm">*</a> But the impression in 
phantasy, as multiplied in this man and that, has only a potentially 
intelligible being. Therefore that impression, as so multiplied, does 
not put any given individual in the species of 'intelligent animal,' 
which is the definition of 'man.' Thus it remains true that the 
specific ratio of 'man' is not multiplied in individual men.<p> 

B.4. It is the first and not the second perfection<a 
href="gc2_73d.htm">*</a> that gives the species to every living thing. 
But the impression in phantasy is a second perfection; and therefore 
not from that multiplied impression has man his species.<p> 

B.6. That which puts a man in the species of man must be something 
abiding in the same individual as long as he remains: otherwise the 
individual would not be always of one and the same species, but now of 
one species and now of another. But the impressions of phantasy do not 
remain always the same in the same man; but new impressions come, and 
previous impressions perish. Therefore the individual man does not 
attain his species by any such impression: nor is it anything in the 
phantasy that conjoins him with the formal principle of his species, 
which is the potential intellect.<p> 

C. But if it is said that the individual does not receive his species 
by the phantasms themselves, but by the faculties in which the 
phantasms are, namely, the phantasy, the memory, and the <i>vis 
cogitativa</i> which is proper to man, and which in the <i>De 
anima</i>, III, v, Aristotle calls the 'passive intellect,'<a 
href="gc2_73e.htm">*</a> the same awkward consequences still follow.<p> 

C.1. Since the <i>vis cogitativa</i> operates only upon particulars, 
the impressions of which it puts apart and puts together;<a 
href="gc2_73f.htm">*</a> and further, since it has a bodily organ 
through which it acts,<a href="gc2_73g.htm">*</a> it does not transcend 
the rank of the sentient soul. But in virtue of his sentient soul, as 
such, man is not a man, but an animal. It still therefore remains true 
that the element, supposed to be multiplied in us, belongs to man only 
in his animal capacity.<p> 

C.2. The cogitative faculty, since it acts through an organ, is not the 
faculty whereby we understand. But the principle whereby we understand 
is the principle whereby man is man. Therefore no individual is man by 
virtue of the cogitative faculty: nor does man by that faculty 
essentially differ from dumb animals, as the Commentator pretends.<p> 

C.3. The cogitative faculty is united to the potential intellect, the 
principle of human intelligence, only by its action of preparing 
phantasms for the active intellect to render them actual terms of 
intelligence and perfections of the potential intellect. But this 
preliminary activity of the cogitative faculty does not always remain 
the same in us. Therefore it cannot be the means whereby man is 
conjoined with the specific principle of the human species, or made a 
member of that species.<p> 

C.4. If the potential intellect of this and that man were numerically 
one and the same, the act of understanding would be one and the same in 
both which is an impossibility.<p> 

D. But if it is said that the act of understanding is multiplied 
according to the diversity of impressions in phantasy, that supposition 
cannot stand.<p> 

D.3. For the potential intellect understands a man, not as this 
individual man, but as man simply, according to the specific essence of 
the race. But this specific essence remains one, however much 
impressions in phantasy arc multiplied, whether in the same man or in 
different men. Therefore no multiplication of phantasms can be the 
cause of multiplication of the act of understanding in the potential 
intellect, considering the same species; and thus we shall still have 
numerically one action in different men.<p> 

D.4. The proper subject in which the habit of knowledge resides is the 
potential intellect. But an accident, so long as it remains 
specifically one, is multiplied only by coming to reside in different 
subjects. If then the potential intellect is one in all men, any habit 
of knowledge specifically the same, say, the habit of grammar, must be 
numerically the same in all men, which is unthinkable.<p> 

E. But to this they say that the subject of the habit of knowledge is 
not the potential intellect, but the passive intellect and the 
cogitative faculty (Chap. <a href="gc2_60.htm">LX</a>): which it cannot 
be.<p> 

E.1. For, as Aristotle shows in the <i>Ethics</i> (II, i), like acts 
engender like habits; and like habits reproduce like acts. Now by the 
acts of the potential intellect there comes to be the habit of 
knowledge in us; and we are competent for the same acts by possession 
of the habit of knowledge. Therefore the habit of knowledge is in the 
potential intellect, not in the passive.<p> 

E.2. Scientific knowledge is of demonstrated conclusions; and 
demonstrated conclusions, like their premises, are universal truths.<a 
href="gc2_73h.htm">*</a> Science therefore is in that faculty which 
takes cognisance of universals. But the passive intellect is not 
cognisant of universals, but of particular notions.<p> 

F. The error of placing the habit of scientific knowledge in the 
passive intellect seems to have arisen from the observation that men 
are found more or less apt for the study of science according to the 
several dispositions of the cogitative faculty and the phantasy.<p> 

F.1. But this aptitude depends on those faculties only as remote 
conditions: so it also depends on the complexion of the body, as 
Aristotle says that men of delicate touch and soft flesh are clever.<a 
href="gc2_73i.htm">*</a> But the proximate 
principle of the act of speculative understanding is the habit of 
scientific knowledge: for this habit must perfect the power of 
understanding to act readily at will, as other habits perfect the 
powers in which they are.<p> 

F.2. The dispositions of the cogitative faculty and the phantasy regard 
the object: they regard the phantasm, which is prepared by the 
efficiency of these faculties readily to become a term of actual 
understanding under the action of the active intellect. But habits do 
not condition objects: they condition faculties. Thus conditions that 
take the edge off terrors<a href="gc2_73j.htm">*</a> are not the habit 
of fortitude: fortitude is a disposition of the conative part of the 
soul to meet terrors. Hence it appears that the habit of knowledge is 
not in the passive but in the potential intellect.<p> 

F.3. If the potential intellect of all men is one, we must suppose that 
the potential intellect has always existed, if men have always existed, 
as Averroists suppose; and much more the active intellect, because 
agent is more honourable than patient, as Aristotle says (<i>De 
anima</i>, III, v).<a href="gc2_73k.htm">*</a> But if the agent is 
eternal, and the recipient eternal, the contents received must be 
eternal also. Therefore the intellectual impressions have been from 
eternity in the potential intellect: therefore it will be impossible 
for it to receive afresh any new intellectual impressions. But the only 
use of sense and phantasy in the process of understanding is that 
intellectual impressions may be gathered from them. At this rate then 
neither sense nor phantasy will be needed for understanding; and we 
come back to the opinion of Plato, that we do not acquire knowledge by 
the senses, but are merely roused by them to remember what we knew 
before.<a href="gc2_73l.htm">*</a><p> 

G. But to this the Commentator replies that intellectual presentations 
reside in a twofold subject: in one subject, from which they have 
everlasting being, namely, the potential intellect; in another subject, 
from which they have a recurring new existence, namely, the phantasm, 
or impression in phantasy. He illustrates this by the comparison of a 
sight-presentation, which has also a twofold subject, the one subject 
being the thing outside the soul, the other the visual faculty. But 
this answer cannot stand.<p> 

G.1. For it is impossible that the action and perfection of the eternal 
should depend on anything temporal. But phantasms are temporal things, 
continually springing up afresh in us from the experience of the 
senses. Therefore the intellectual impressions, whereby the potential 
intellect is actuated and brought to activity, cannot possibly depend 
on phantasms in the way that visual impressions depend on things 
outside the soul.<a href="gc2_73m.htm">*</a><p> 

G.2. Nothing receives what it has already got. But before any sensory 
experience of mine or yours there were intellectual impressions in the 
potential intellect: for the generations before us could not have 
understood had not the potential intellect been reduced to act by 
intellectual impressions. Nor can it be said that those impressions, 
formerly received in the potential intellect, have ceased to be: 
because the potential intellect not only receives, but keeps what it 
receives: hence it is called the "place of ideas."<a 
href="gc2_73n.htm">*</a> Therefore, on this showing, no impressions 
from our phantasms are received in the potential intellect.<p> 

G.6 and 7. If the potential intellect receives no intellectual 
impressions from the phantasms that are in us, because it has already 
received them from the phantasms of those who were before us, then for 
the like reason we must say that it receives impressions from the 
phantasms of no generation of men, whom another generation has 
preceded. But every generation has been preceded by some previous 
generation, if the world and human society is eternal, as Averroists 
suppose. Therefore the potential intellect never receives any 
impressions from phantasms; and from this it seems to follow that the 
potential intellect has no need of phantasms to understand. But we 
(<i>nos</i>) understand by the potential intellect. Therefore neither shall 
we need sense and phantasm for our understanding: which is manifestly 
false and contrary to the opinion of Aristotle.<a href="gc2_73o.htm">*</a><p> 

For the potential intellect, like every other substance, operates 
according to the mode of its nature. Now according to its nature it is 
the form of the body. Hence it understands immaterial things, but views 
them in some material medium; as is shown by the fact that in teaching 
universal truths particular examples are alleged, in which what is said 
may be seen. Therefore the need which the potential intellect has of 
the phantasm before receiving the intellectual impression is different 
from that which it has after the impression has been received. Before 
reception, it needs the phantasm to gather from it the intellectual 
impression, so that the phantasm then stands to the potential intellect 
as an object which moves it. But after receiving the impression, of 
which the phantasm is the vehicle, it needs the phantasm as an 
instrument or basis of the impression received. Thus by command of the 
intellect there is formed in the phantasy a phantasm answering to such 
and such an intellectual impression; and in this phantasm the 
intellectual impression shines forth as an exemplar in the thing 
exemplified, or as in an image.<a href="gc2_73p.htm">*</a><p> 

G.8. If the potential intellect is one for all men and eternal, by this 
time there must have been received in it the intellectual impressions 
of all things that have been known by any men whatsoever. Then, as 
every one of us understands by the potential intellect, -- nay, as the act 
of understanding in each is the act of that potential intellect 
understanding, -- every one of us must understand all that has been 
understood by any other men whatsoever.<p> 

H. To this the Commentator replies that we do not understand by the 
potential intellect except in so far as it is conjoined with us through 
the impressions in our phantasy, and that these phantasms are not the 
same nor similar amongst all men. And this answer seems to be in 
accordance with the doctrine that has gone before: for, apart from any 
affirmation of the unity of the potential intellect, it is true that we 
do not understand those things, the impressions whereof are in the 
potential intellect, unless the appropriate phantasms are at hand. But 
that this answer does not altogether escape the difficulty, may be thus 
shown.<p> 

When the potential intellect has been actualised by the reception of an 
intellectual impression, it is competent to act of itself: hence we see 
that, once we have got the knowledge of a thing, it is in our power to 
consider it again when we wish: nor are we at a loss for lack of 
phantasms, because it is in our power to form phantasms suitable to the 
consideration which we wish, unless there happens to be some impediment 
on the part of the organ, as in persons out of their mind or in a 
comatose state. But if in the potential intellect there are 
intellectual impressions of all branches of knowledge, -- as we must 
say, if that intellect is one and eternal, -- then the necessity of 
phantasms for the potential intellect will be the same as in his case 
who already has knowledge, and wishes to study and consider some point 
of that knowledge, for that also he could not do without phantasms.<a 
href="gc2_73q.htm">*</a> Since then every man understands by the 
potential intellect so far as it is reduced to act by intellectual 
impressions, so every man should be able on this theory to regard, 
whenever he would, all the known points of all sciences: which is 
manifestly false, for at that rate no one would need a teacher. 
Therefore the potential intellect is not one and eternal.<p>
