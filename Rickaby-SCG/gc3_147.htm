<H1>That it is Lawful for judges to inflict Punishments</h1>

MEN who on earth are set over others are ministers of divine 
providence. But it is the order of providence that the wicked 
be punished.<p> 

4. Good stands in no need of evil, but the other way about (Chap. XI). 
Whatever then is of necessity for the preservation of good, cannot be 
of itself evil.<A HREF="gc3_147a.htm>*</a> But for the preservation of 
concord among men it is necessary for penalties to be inflicted on the 
wicked.<p> 

5. The common good is better than the good of the individual. There 
fore some particular good must be withdrawn for the preservation of the 
common good. But the life of certain pestilent fellows is a hindrance 
to the common good, that is, to the concord of human society. Such 
persons therefore are to be withdrawn by death from the society of 
men.<A HREF="gc3_147b.htm>*</a><p>

Hence the Apostle says: <i>He beareth not the sword in vain</i> (Rom. 
xiii, 4: cf. 1 Pet. ii, 14).<p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of those who say that corporal punishments 
are unlawful, and quote in support of their error such texts as, 
<i>Thou shalt not kill</i> (Exod. xx, 13): <i>Let both grow until the 
harvest</i> (Matt. xiii, 30). But these are frivolous allegations. For 
the same law which says, <i>Thou shalt not kill</i>, adds afterwards: 
<i>Thou shalt not suffer poisoners (maleficos,</i> 
<b>pharmakous</b><i>) to live</i> (Exod. xxii, 18). And as for both 
growing until the harvest, how that is to be understood appears from 
what follows: <i>lest perchance in gathering the tares ye root out 
along with them the wheat also</i>: in this passage then the killing of 
the wicked is forbidden where it cannot be done without danger to the 
good, as happens when the wicked are not yet clearly marked off from 
the good by manifest sins, or when there is ground for apprehension 
that the wicked may involve many good men in their ruin.<p> 

The fate of the wicked being open to conversion so long as they live 
does not preclude their being open also to the just punishment of 
death. Indeed the danger threatening the community from their life is 
greater and more certain than the good expected by their conversion. 
Besides, in the hour of death, they have every facility for turning to 
God by repentance. And if they are so obstinate that even in the hour 
of death their heart will not go back upon its wickedness, a fairly 
probable reckoning may be made that they never would have returned to a 
better mind.
