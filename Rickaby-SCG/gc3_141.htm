<H1>That a Man's Acts are punished or rewarded by God</h1>

TO him it belongs to punish or reward, to whom it belongs to lay down 
the law. But it belongs to divine providence to lay down the law for men 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc3_114.htm">CXIV</a>): therefore also to punish or 
reward.<p> 

2. Whenever there is due order to an end, that order must lead to the 
end, and departure from that order must shut out the end: for things 
that are according to an end derive their necessity from the end, in 
such way that they must be, if the end is to follow, and while they are 
without impediment, the end ensues. But God has imposed upon men's acts 
an order in respect of their final good. If then that order is duly laid 
down, it must be that they who walk according to it shall gain their 
final good, that is, be rewarded, and they who depart from that order by 
sin shall be shut out from their final good, that is, punished.<p> 

3. As physical things are subject to the order of divine providence, so 
also human acts. In regard to both the one and the other the due order 
may be observed, or it may be transgressed. But there is this 
difference, that the observation or transgression of the due order lies 
in the power of the human will, but not in the power of physical 
things. As then in physical things, when due order is observed in them, 
there follows of natural necessity their preservation and good, but 
their destruction and evil when the due and natural order is departed 
from; so in human things it needs must be that when a man voluntarily 
observes the order of law by Heaven imposed upon him, he gains good, not 
of necessity, but by the dispensation of the ruler, -- that is to say, he 
gains reward; and conversely, when the order of law is neglected, he 
comes to evil, that is to say, is punished.<p> 

4. It is part of the perfection of God's goodness to have no part of 
nature in disorder. Hence we see in the physical world that every evil 
is part of an orderly arrangement to some good, as the killing of the 
sheep is the feeding of the wolf.  Since then human acts are subject to 
the order of divine providence as well as physical events, the evil that 
happens in human acts must lead up in an orderly way to good. But this 
is most aptly brought about by the punishment of sins: for thus excesses 
beyond the due amount are embraced under the order of justice, which 
restores equality. Man exceeds the due degree and proper amount by 
preference of his own will to that of God, satisfying himself against 
the ordinance of God: this inequality is removed by his being compelled 
to suffer something against his will according to the same ordinance.<p> 

6. Divine providence has arranged things so that one shall profit 
another. But it is most fitting for man to be advanced to his final good 
as well by the good as by the evil of his fellow-man, being excited to 
do well by seeing well-doers rewarded, and withheld from evil-doing by 
seeing evil-doers punished.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>I am the Lord thy God . . . . visiting the 
iniquities of the fathers upon the children . . . . and doing mercy a 
thousandfold upon them that love me and keep my commandments</i> (Exod. 
xx, 5, 6): <i>Thou wilt render to every one according to his works<i> 
(Ps. lxi, 13): <i>To them who, according to patience in good work, seek 
glory and honour and incorruption, life everlasting: but to them who 
. . . . obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and 
indignation</i> (Rom. ii, 7, 8).<A HREF="gc3_141a.htm">*</a>
