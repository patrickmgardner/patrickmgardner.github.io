<H1>That Evil is an Accidental Cause</h1>

Running through all the species of causes, we find that evil is a cause 
accidentally.  In the species of efficient cause, since through the 
deficiency of power in the active cause there follows defect in the 
effect and action.  In the species of material cause, since through the 
indisposition of the matter there follows a defect in the product.  In 
the species of formal cause, since to one form there is always annexed 
the privation of another form.  In the species of final cause, since 
the evil annexed to an undue end means the hindering of the end that is 
due.<A HREF="gc3_14a.htm">*</a>
