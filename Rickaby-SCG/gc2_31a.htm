St Thomas's position in these eight chapters, XXXI-XXXVIII, is 
that the existence of creatures from eternity can neither be proved nor 
disproved by philosophy. He considers it certain from revelation, and 
from revelation only, that creation has not been from eternity. This 
excited the surprise and indignation of some, who were confident that 
their <i>a priori</i> arguments, which see in Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_38.htm">XXXVIII</a>, proved to a demonstration the 
impossibility of any creation from eternity. Against them St Thomas 
directed one of his <i>Opuscula</i>, n. xxiii, <i>De AEternitate Mundi, 
contra Murmurantes</i>.<p> 

The eternity of creation was a leading principle with that master of 
thought in St Thomas's day, and for many succeeding centuries, Averroes 
the Commentator, of whom we shall have much to say presently.<p>
