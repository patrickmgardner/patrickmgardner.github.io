St Thomas argues upon this passage, <i>De anima</i>, I, iii. 26: 
"They try to describe to us the qualities of the soul, but add no 
further details as to the body which is to receive it, as though it 
were possible, as the Pythagorean fables have it, for any soul to 
array itself in any body: whereas it seems proper that every body 
should have its own species and form. It is as though they said that 
the carpenter's art got into the bagpipes: for as art uses its 
instruments, so the soul has to use the body."
