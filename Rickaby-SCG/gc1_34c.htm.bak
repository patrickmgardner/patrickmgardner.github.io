Children have some inkling of substance before
they have any of accidents, as is shown by this, that
the first names they use are nouns substantive, not
adjectives. On dumb animals Cardinal Newman
writes in his <i>Grammar of Assent</i> (p. 111, cd. 1895)
"It is one peculiarity of animal natures to be 
susceptible of phenomena through the channels of
sense: it is another to have in those sensible 
phenomena a perception of the individuals to which
this or that group of them belongs. This perception
of individual things, amid the mass of shapes and
colours which meets their sight, is given to brutes in
large measure, and that, apparently, from the 
moment of their birth.  It is by no mere physical instinct,
such as that which leads him to his mother for milk,
that the new-dropped lamb recognises each of his
fellow-lambkins as a whole, consisting of many parts
bound up in one, and, before he is an hour old,
makes experience of his and their rival individualities. 
And much more distinctly do the horse and dog
recognise even the personality of their master."
