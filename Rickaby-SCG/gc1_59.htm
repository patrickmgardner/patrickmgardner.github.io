<H1>That the Truth to be found in Propositions is not excluded 
from God</h1>

ALTHOUGH the knowledge of the divine mind is not after the manner 
of combination and separation of ideas in affirmative and 
negative propositions, nevertheless there is not excluded from it 
that truth which, according to the Philosopher, obtains only in 
such combinations and separations.<A HREF="gc1_59a.htm">*</a>  
For since the truth of the intellect is an equation of the 
intellect and the thing, inasmuch as the intellect says that to 
be which is, or that not to be which is not, truth belongs to 
that in the intellect which the intellect says, not to the act 
whereby it says it; for it is not requisite to the truth of the 
intellect that the mere act of understanding be equated to the 
thing, but what the mind says and knows by understanding must be 
equated to the thing, so that the case of the thing shall be as 
the mind says it is.  But God by his simple understanding, in 
which there is no combination and separation of ideas, knows not 
only the essence of things, but also the propositions that are 
tenable concerning them (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_57.htm">LVII</a>, <A 
HREF="gc1_58.htm>LVIII</a>). Thus what the divine mind says by 
understanding is affirmation and negation.<A 
HREF="gc1_59b.htm">*</a>  Therefore the simplicity of the divine 
mind does not import the shutting out from it of truth.
