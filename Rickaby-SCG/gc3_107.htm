<H1>That the Subsistent Intelligence, whose aid is employed in Magic, 
is not Evil by Nature<A HREF="gc3_107a.htm">*</a></h1>

WHATEVER is in things must be either cause or caused: otherwise it 
would not be in relation with other things. The subsistent beings in 
question then are either causes only or they are also caused. If they 
are causes only, evil cannot be cause of anything except incidentally 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc3_14.htm">XIV</a>); and everything incidental must be 
reducible to that which is ordinary:<A HREF="gc3_107b.htm">*</a> 
therefore there must be something in them prior to the evil that is 
there, something whereby they are causes. But that which is prior in 
everything is its nature and essence. Therefore these subsistent beings 
are not evil in their nature. The same conclusion follows if they are 
things caused. For no agent acts except with some intention of good: 
evil therefore cannot be the effect of any cause except incidentally. 
But what is caused incidentally only cannot be by nature, since every 
nature has a regular and definite mode of coming into being.<p> 

4. Nothing can exist unless it has existence from the first being, and 
the first being is the sovereign good (B. II, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_15.htm">XV</a>). But since every being, as such, acts to the 
production of its own likeness, all things that come of the first being 
must be good.<p> 

7. Since the will tends to good grasped by the understanding, and finds 
therein its natural and proper object and end, it is impossible for any 
subsistent intelligence to have by nature a bad will, unless the 
understanding in it naturally is mistaken in its judgement of what is 
good. But no understanding can be so mistaken: for false judgements in 
acts of the understanding are like monsters in the physical universe, 
which are not according to nature, but out of the way of nature: for 
the good of the understanding and its natural end is the knowledge of 
truth.<p> 

This is also confirmed by the authority of Holy Scripture: for it is 
said, <i>Every creature is good</i> (i Tim. iv, 4): <i>God saw all 
things that he had made, and they were very good</i> (Gen. i, 31).<p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of the Manicheans, who suppose that these 
subsistent intelligences, commonly called demons or devils, are 
naturally evil.<p> 

Porphyry tells in his Letter to Anebo<A HREF="gc3_107c.htm">*</a> that 
there is a certain kind of spirits who make it their business to listen 
to magicians, a kind naturally deceitful, assuming every form, 
personating gods [angels] and men and souls of the departed; and that 
this kind of being it is which makes all these appearances for better 
or for worse: for the rest, that this kind of spirit renders no 
assistance towards anything that is really good, but on the contrary is 
the author of evil counsel, and accuses and hampers and envies the 
earnest votaries of virtue, and is full of hastiness and pride, 
rejoices in the smell of burnt meats, and is captivated by 
flatteries.<A HREF="gc3_107d.htm">*</a> The only thing to quarrel with 
in this account is his saying that such malice is in these spirits 
"naturally."<A HREF="gc3_107e.htm">*</a>
