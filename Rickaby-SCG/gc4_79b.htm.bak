Many of us remain quite unconvinced by these
<i>a priori</i> reasons. We believe in the resurrection of the
body as a revealed doctrine. But we look upon it as
not susceptible of <i>a priori</i> proof: in other words not
like the immortality of the soul, a property incident
to human nature as such. The body will rise again,
because God has been pleased to place man in a supernatural 
state, and in Christ to renew the privileges of
that state, one of those privileges being, as St Thomas
points out, the final deliverance of the body from
death. Of the three arguments last given in the text,
the first two rest upon the assumption that the soul,
which is the 'form' of the body in man's mortal
life, becomes after death a nude 'form' crying for its
'matter.' The assumption is not incontrovertible. After
death, the change of the soul lifewards can scarcely be
less than the change of the body deathwards. The
disembodied spirit must be mightily translated to
higher existence, if, bereft of its senses, it still lives
and energises and understands, and does not lie stunned
and dormant, as in a trance, a supposition which no
Catholic theologian will allow (see Chap. XCI). Who
shall define this higher existence? Who knows and
can tell us that such elevation does not mean a fulness 
of spiritual nature, independent henceforth of
matter and organs of sense? But if so independent,
how shall the soul ever return to be the form of a
body? It shall not return to be the form of an animal
body, but of a spiritual body (1 Cor. xv, 44), that is, of
a body entirely subservient to the soul, and no hindrance 
to its spiritual functions, as St Thomas presently 
explains (Chap. LXXXVI).<p>

Of the two philosophies that have most affected
Christian thought, Platonism makes for the immortality 
of the soul, but against the resurrection of the
body. Aristotelianism raises a difficulty against the
immortality of the soul: how shall the 'form' continue
when the 'matter' is gone? But that obstacle surmounted, 
Aristotelianism favours the resurrection, as
St Thomas's arguments show. Cf. II, Chap. <A
