The position supposed is this: 'Nothing is <i>made</i>, 
manufactured, or concocted out of nothing: but something may be 
<i>created</i> out of nothing.' I am not aware however of any of the 
ancients having any idea of creation out of nothing. There is no word 
in <i>Classical Greek</i> for 'creation' in the theological sense.
