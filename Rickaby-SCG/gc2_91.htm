<H1>That there are Subsistent Intelligences not united with Bodies<A 
HREF="gc2_91a.htm">*</a></h1>

WHEN human bodies perish in death, the substance of the intelligence 
remains in perpetuity (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_79.htm">LXXIX</a>). Now if 
the substance of the intelligence that remains is one for all, as some 
say, it follows necessarily that it has being apart from body; and thus 
our <i>thesis</i> is proved, that some subsistent intelligence exists 
apart from a body. But if a multitude of intelligent souls remain 
after the destruction of their bodies, then some subsistent 
intelligences will have the property of subsisting without bodies, all 
the more inasmuch as it has been shown that souls do not pass from one 
body to another (Chap <A HREF="gc2_83.htm">LXXXIII</a>). But the 
property of subsisting apart from bodies is an incidental property in 
souls, since naturally they are the forms of bodies. But what is 
ordinary must be prior to what is incidental. There must then be some 
subsistent intelligences naturally prior to souls; and to these 
intelligences the ordinary property must attach of subsisting without 
bodies.<p> 

3. The higher nature in its lowest manifestation touches the next lower 
nature in its highest. But intelligent nature is higher than 
corporeal, and at the same time touches it in some part, which is the 
intelligent soul. As then the body perfected by the intelligent soul 
is highest in the genus of bodies, so the intelligent soul united to 
the body must be lowest in the genus of subsistent intelligences. 
There are then subsistent intelligences not united with bodies, 
superior in the order of nature to the soul.<A HREF="gc2_91b.htm">*</a><p>

7. The substance of a thing must be proportionate to its activity, 
because activity is the actualisation and perfection of an active 
substance. But understanding is the proper activity of an intelligent 
substance. Therefore an intelligent substance must be competent for 
such activity. But understanding is an activity not exercised through 
any bodily organ, and not needing the body except in so far as objects 
of understanding are borrowed from objects of sense. But that is an 
imperfect mode of understanding: the perfect mode of understanding is 
the understanding of those objects which are in themselves 
intelligible: whereas it is an imperfect mode of understanding when 
those things only are understood, which are not of themselves 
intelligible, but are rendered intelligible by intellect.<A 
HREF="gc2_91c.htm">*</a> If then before everything imperfect there 
must be something perfect in that kind,<A HREF="gc2_91d.htm">*</a> 
there must be antecedently to human souls, which understand what they 
gather from phantasms, sundry subsistent intelligences which understand 
things in themselves intelligible, not gathering their knowledge from 
sensible objects, and therefore in their nature separate from anything 
corporeal.<p>
