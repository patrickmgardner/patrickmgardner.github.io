We live by the light and heat of the central fire
of the sun. Electricity, which we may call a fire, is
now taken to be the essential basis of all matter. All
the bright and delicious things of life come of fire.
Without fire, no civilisation, no humanity, no joy on
earth. If then the saying holds that "in the things
wherein a man has sinned, in the same shall he be
punished," fire forms not an unfit punishment for
one who has abused the good things of our present
existence.
