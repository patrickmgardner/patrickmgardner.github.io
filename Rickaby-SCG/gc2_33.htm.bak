<H1>Reasons alleged for the Eternity of the World on the part 
Creatures, with answers to the same</h1>

<i>Arg. 1.</i> There are creatures in which there is no potentiality of 
not being (see Chap. <A HREF="gc2_30.htm">XXX</a>): it is impossible 
for them not to be, and  therefore they always must be.<p>

<i>Reply</i> (Chap. XXXVI). The necessity of such creatures being is 
only a relative necessity, as shown above (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_30.htm">XXX</a>): it does not involve the creature's 
always having been: it does not follow upon its substance: but when the 
creature is already established in being, this necessity involves the 
impossibility of its not-being.<A HREF="gc2_33a.htm">*</a><p>  

<i>Arg. 3.</i> Every change must either go on everlastingly, or have some 
other change preceding it. But change always has been: therefore also 
changeable things: therefore creatures.<p>  

<i>Reply.</i> It has already been shown (Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc2_12.htm">XII</a>, <A HREF="gc2_17.htm">XVII</a>) that without 
any change in God, the agent, He may act to the production of a new 
thing, that has not always been. But if a new thing may be produced by 
Him, He may also originate a process of change.<A 
HREF="gc2_33b.htm">*</a><p> 

<i>Arg. 5.</i> If time is perpetual, motion must be perpetual, time 
being the  record of motion.<A HREF="gc2_33c.htm">*</a> But time must 
be perpetual: for time is inconceivable without a present instant, as a 
line is inconceivable without a point: now a present instant is always 
inconceivable without the ending of a past and the beginning of a 
future instant; and thus every given present instant has before it a 
time preceding and after it a time succeeding, and so there can be no 
first or last time. It follows that created substances in motion have 
been from eternity.<p>  

<i>Reply.</i> This argument rather supposes than proves the eternity of 
motion. The reason why the same instant is the beginning of the future 
and the end of the past is because any given phase of motion is the 
beginning and end of different phases. There is no showing that every 
instant must be of this character, unless it be assumed that every 
given phase of time comes between motion going before and motion 
following after, which is tantamount to assuming the perpetuity of 
motion. Assuming on the contrary that motion is not perpetual, one may 
say that the first instant of time is the beginning of the future, and 
not the end of any past instant. Even in any particular case of motion 
we may mark a phase which is the beginning only of movement and not the 
end of any: otherwise every particular case of motion would be 
perpetual, which is impossible.<A HREF="gc2_33d.htm">*</a><p>  

<i>Arg. 6.</i> If time has not always been, we may mark a non-existence 
of time prior to its being. In like manner, if it is not always to be, 
we may mark a non-existence of it subsequent to its being. But priority 
and subsequence in point of duration cannot be unless time is; and at 
that rate time must have been before it was, and shall be after it has 
ceased, which is absurd. Time then must be eternal. But time is an 
accident, and cannot be without a subject. But the subject of it is not 
God, who is above time and beyond motion (B. I, Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc1_13.htm">XIII</a>, <A HREF="gc1_15.htm">XV</a>). The only 
alternative left is that some created substance must be eternal.<p>  

<i>Reply.</i> There is nothing in this argument to evince that the very 
supposition of time not being supposes that time is (read, <i>Si 
ponitur tempus non esse, ponatur esse</i>). For when we speak of 
something prior to the being of time, we do not thereby assert any real 
part of time, but only an imaginary part. When we say, 'Time has being 
after not being', we mean that there was no instant of time before this 
present marked instant: as when we say that there is nothing above the 
stellar universe, we do not mean that there is any place beyond the 
stellar universe, which may be spoken of as 'above' it, but that above 
it there is no 'place' at all.<A HREF="gc2_33e.htm">*</a><p>
