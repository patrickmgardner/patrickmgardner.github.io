<link rel="stylesheet" href="../resource.css">Evolutionism says just the opposite.  Is not the whole 
notion of development a process from the imperfect to the 
perfect? But the eternal question abides -- What begot the 
first germ, containing in itself the promise and potency of 
the vast development which we see? St Thomas asserts a 
<i>priority of nature</i> of the perfect to the imperfect, 
not a <i>priority of time</i>. God, though <i>prior in 
duration</i>, is not <i>prior in time</i> to the creature, 
as He is not in time at all: there is no time antecedent to 
creation. In the series of created causes, the imperfect is 
doubtless <i>prior in time</i> to the perfect.  The first 
verses of Genesis assure us of that, as well as all sound 
study of evolution.
