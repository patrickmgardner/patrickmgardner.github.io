In the days of the schoolmen, as in those of Aristotle, exclusive of 
philosophy and theology, one speculative science alone had attained any 
real development, mathematics. Philosophers therefore drew their 
illustrations from mathematics. Now it is true in mathematics that a 
perfect comprehension of the universal carries a knowledge of all 
subordinate particulars. Whoever comprehended a hexagon completely, 
would know all things that ever could be affirmed of any hexagon, as 
such. And it is only with the hexagon as such, that is to say with the 
hexagon as a form, that the mathematician is concerned: he cares 
nothing about its material. But in the world of natural history, while 
still only the lion, as such, or the fig, as such, is the strict matter 
of science: nevertheless this scientific knowledge is only obtainable 
by observation and experiment upon actual lions, or figs; and 
scientific men busy themselves accordingly about the vicissitudes that 
do actually overtake such existing things. The most thorough 
comprehension of the specific essence of a fig could not instruct a 
man, -- no, nor an angel either, -- on the fact whether there will be a 
plentiful or a poor crop of figs in Palestine in the year 1910. This 
fact, and indeed the whole course of natural history, -- apart from the 
free acts of God and man, and the effect of those acts upon material 
things, is absolutely deducible from a knowledge of the 'universal 
nature' of physical agents, joined to a knowledge (not contained in the 
'universal') of the primitive collocation of materials. But could even 
angelic intellect make this stupendous deduction of the whole history 
of the physical universe from its primary data?<p>

We judge of angels from the analogy of the human mind. The human mind 
knows what is called at Oxford 'the manifold' of individual material 
things through the senses. To the intellect of man, <i>away from 
sensation</i>, this 'manifold' of individuals is unintelligible, as St 
Thomas also says it is unintelligible, because intellect always 
universalises. How then shall pure intelligence, apart from all 
faculty of sensation, know the individual? The analogy, which has been 
our guide, here breaks down. We cannot deny to the angel the cognition 
of individual things: not, I think, even with St Thomas for our guide, 
can we give a satisfactory account of how he has that cognition. If 
the schoolmen had a fault, it was that of explaining too much: though, 
I dare say, they considered many of their explanations merely 
hypothetical and tentative. See B. I, Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc1_8.htm">VIII</a>, <A HREF="gc1_9.htm">IX</a>.<p>

In the <i>Summa Theologica</i>, I, q. 55, art 2, St Thomas more clearly 
faces the difficulty of attributing to angels any knowledge of the 
actual facts of creation. He acknowledges (art. 1) that the mere 
consciousness of themselves in their own essential nature would be 
insufficient to afford them such knowledge. Therefore he supposes 
that, over and above their essential nature, there was stamped upon 
them at their creation a multitude of intelligible impressions, innate 
ideas in fact, corresponding to the facts of creation; and that by 
knowing themselves, as thus impressed, they know the world. Scotus 
disagrees with St Thomas on this point: indeed it remains a very open 
question. St Thomas's words are (l.c.):<p>

"The impressions whereby angels understand are not gathered from things 
but are connatural to the said angels. . . . Angels are wholly free 
from bodies, subsisting immaterially in intellectual being: and 
therefore they gain their intellectual perfection by an intellectual 
efflux, whereby they received from God presentations of known things 
along with their intellectual nature. . . . In the mind of an angel 
there are likenesses of creatures, not from the creatures themselves, 
but from God, who is the cause of creatures."<p>

But from this it would seem that angels ought to know all future 
events, a corollary rejected by St Thomas, q. 57, art. 3.
