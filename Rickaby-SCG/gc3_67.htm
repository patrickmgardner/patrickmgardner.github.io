<H1>That God is the Cause of Activity in all Active Agents</h1>

AS God not only gave being to things when they first began to be, but 
also causes being in them so long as they exist (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_65.htm">LXV</a>); so He did not once for all furnish them 
with active powers, but continually causes those powers in them, so 
that, if the divine influx were to cease, all activity would cease.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Thou hast wrought all our works in us, O Lord</i> (Isa. 
xxvi, 12). And for this reason frequently in the Scriptures the 
effects of nature are put down to the working of God, because He it is 
that works in every agent, physical or voluntary: e.g., <i>Hast thou not 
drawn me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese? with skin and 
flesh thou hast clothed me, with bones and sinews thou hast put me 
together</i> (Job x, 10, 11).
