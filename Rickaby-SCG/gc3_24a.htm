Incidentally and indirectly, Sir Isaac Newton may be said to have 
done as much for theology and psychology as he has done directly for 
astronomy.  He has banished from the speculations of the psychologist 
and the theologian all concern about the stars, all interest in 
<i>corpus coeleste</i> and <i>primum mobile</i>.  He and his successors 
have wiped out for ever star-worship and astrology; and astronomy thus 
remaining on their hands, they have assorted it among the sciences to 
which it is nearest akin, namely, dynamics and chemistry, to trouble 
the metaphysician no more.  -- Of old, men worshipped the stars, as the 
Hebrew prophets reproached the people with adoring <i>all the host of 
heaven</i> (4 Kings xxi, 3, 5: Ezech. viii, 16: Jer xix, 13: Amos v, 
26: Acts vii, 42).  When they had ceased to worship, men still believed 
in the stars, and star-carrying crystal spheres, affecting the origin 
and development of planets and animals on earth, and even human 
thoughts and elections.  From these fancies Plato is fairly free: he 
speaks with scant respect for the stars in <i>Rep.</i> vii, 529.  Nor 
do they go for much in the genuine writings of Aristotle.  It was the 
Oriental genius of the Neo-Platonists, and after them the Arabians, 
that brought in the heavenly bodies to the perturbation of mental 
philosophy.  Albertus Magnus and St Thomas followed this lead.  I may 
refer to the original Latin of the <i>Contra Gentiles</i>, B. III, 
Chapp. XXII, XXIII, LXXXII-LXXXVIII, CIV, CV.  St Thomas speaks of the 
'heavenly bodies' meaning thereby, not the stars, but the star-bearing 
crystal spheres.  The <i>corpus coeleste</i>, 'the heavenly body' 
<i>par excellence</i> with him, is the tenth and outermost crystalline 
sphere, which by its diurnal motion from east to west controls the 
motion of all inferior material things, and is called the <i>primum 
mobile</i>.  St Thomas argues that this outermost sphere itself is 
moved by some intelligence, either by a soul animating it, or by an 
angel, or immediately by God.  Through this <i>primum mobile</i>, St 
Thomas thinks, God governs the universe and fixes the qualities of the 
whole material universe.  So the St Thomas of the thirteenth century, 
but no <i>Aquinas Modernus</i>.  We must not build our theology on a 
mistaken astronomy.  On the whole we may do well, following Newman's 
lead, to seek God certainly in the starry heavens, which are ever 
telling his glory (Ps. xviii), but to seek Him still more in the hearts 
and consciences of men, in the realm of mind rather than in the realm 
of matter.  This, according to St Thomas, is the mode of natural 
cognition by which the angels know God, "through study of their own 
substances" (Chap. XLIX).  And our soul is a spiritual substance also.
