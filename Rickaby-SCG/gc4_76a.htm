The episcopate is established by positive indefeasible institution; and 
there are reasons why it should be: yet who shall pretend that 
presbyterian government, and ordination by an assembly of presbyters, 
is, absolutely speaking, an intrinsic absurdity? Or that it could not 
have been instituted by Christ, had He so willed? Here, as repeatedly 
in this work, St Thomas's <i>necesse est</i> is no argument of antecedent 
necessity, but of mere <i>congruentia post factum</i>.
