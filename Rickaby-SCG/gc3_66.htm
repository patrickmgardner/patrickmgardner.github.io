<H1>That nothing gives Being except in as much as it acts in the Power 
of God</h1>

NOTHING gives being except in so much as it is an actual being.
But God preserves things in actuality.<p>

5. The order of effects is according to the order of causes. But among 
all effects the first is being: all other things, as they proceed from 
their cause, are determinations of being. Therefore being is the proper 
effect of the prime agent, and all other things act inasmuch as they 
act in the power of the prime agent. Secondary agents, which are in a 
manner particular determinants of the action of the prime agent, have 
for the proper effects of their action other perfections determinant of 
being.<A HREF="gc3_66a.htm">*</a><p> 

6. What is essentially of a certain nature, is properly the cause of 
that which comes to have that nature only by participation.<A 
HREF="gc3_66b.htm">*</a> But God alone is being by essence, all others 
are beings by participation. Therefore the being of everything that 
exists is an effect properly due to God; so that anything that brings 
anything else into being does so insomuch as it acts in the power 
of God.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>God created all things to be</i> (Wisd. i, 14).
