A sort of canon of cosmic architecture.  And in the architecture of 
human hands it makes more for the beauty of a frieze to have a 
procession of various figures, like the procession of Athenian knights 
in the frieze of the Parthenon, than to have one cast reproduced all 
round, suggestive of so much a foot.  It makes for the beauty, and adds 
to the expense, but with the Creator there is no question of expense.  
But is not every human character the presentation of a distinct 
history, and every human face and form expressive of an individuality 
all its own?
