Alexander of Aphrodisias (there were three towns of that name, one in 
Caria, one in Cilicia, and one in Thrace) expounded Aristotle at 
Athens, A.D. 200. Among the Greek commentators on the Philosopher he 
holds the place that Averroes holds among the Mohammedans: hence his 
similar surname of <b>ho ex&ecirc;g&ecirc;t&ecirc;s</b> (the 
commentator). Averroes, while continually wrangling with Alexander, 
especially on the nature of the potential intellect, speaks of him with 
great regard. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the schools of 
Northern Italy were filled with eager disputants, Alexandrists and 
Averroists. St Thomas in his later <i>Opusculum de unitate 
intellectus</i> denies that Alexander held the view which he here 
ascribes to him: he says that it was falsely imputed to him by 
Averroes. Be that as it may, the opinion at present standing for 
confutation comes to this. The 'potential intellect,' to all intents 
and purposes, is identified with what Averroes, and St Thomas with him, 
calls the 'passive intellect,' described in the opening of Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_60.htm">LX</a>, which 'intellect' is admitted on all hands 
to be <i>in man</i>, not extrinsic to him.<p>

There is a good account of Alexander in a Dissertation by Augustus 
Elfes, published at Bonn (Straus) in 1887, entitled <i>Aristotelis 
doctrina de mente humana, pars prima, Alexandri Aphrodisiensis et 
Joannis Philoponi commentationes</i>. Alexander calls the potential 
intellect <b>hulikos</b>, as in the Latin versions of Averroes it is 
called <i>materialis</i>. But with Alexander the potential intellect is 
a bodily (organic) faculty: in fact it is silently confounded with the 
<b>nous path&ecirc;tikos</b> of Aristotle; whereas in Averroes, St 
Thomas, and (we may add) in Aristotle himself, it is a spiritual 
faculty. This is the great mistake of Alexander. He says, 
<b>epit&ecirc;deiot&ecirc;s tis estin ho hulikos nous, eoik&ocirc;s 
pinakidi agraph&ocirc;</b> -- in this agreeing with Aristotle, <i>De 
anima</i>, III, iv, 12: who says the potential intellect, to begin 
with, is like "a notebook in which nothing is actually written." The 
word <b>epit&ecirc;deiot&ecirc;s</b> appears in St Thomas as 
<i>praeparatio</i> (predisposition). To meet Aristotle's saying that 
the potential intellect <b>apath&ecirc;s</b> (unimpressed by material 
things), Alexander distinguishes between the predisposition of the 
tablet to be written on, and the tablet itself: the tablet, he says, is 
impressed and changed, but not the predisposition. This looks like 
quibbling. Alexander made the 'active intellect' one for all men; and 
even identified it with God.<p>

On the other hand, G. Rodier, <i>Aristote, Trait&eacute; de l'ame</i> 
(Leroux, Paris, 1900), vol. II, pp. 457, 460, has a clear statement and 
able defence of Alexander's notion of <b>epit&ecirc;deiot&ecirc;s</b>.
