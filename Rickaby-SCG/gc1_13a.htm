I refrain from translating the rest of this lengthy argument, based 
upon the treacherous foundation of Aristotelian Physics. See Aristotle, 
<i>Physics</i>, vii, viii <i>Metaphysics</i>, xi, 7. Whoever will 
derive an argument for the divine existence from the mechanism of the 
heavens must take his principles from Newton, not from Aristotle. 
Besides Motion he must take account of Force and Energy, not to say of 
Cosmic Evolution.  He must know not only the motion of impact, as when 
a row of ninepins knock one another down from a push given to the 
first, but also the motion that is set up by gravitation. Aristotle 
knew nothing of gravitation; and only half knew the inertia of matter 
declared by Newton's first law of motion. He supposed that motion, of 
its own nature, not only needed starting but also needed continual 
keeping up by some continually acting cause. He did not know that the 
question with a moving body is, not what there is to keep it in motion, 
but what there is to stop it.<P> 

It would be a mistake to represent the Aristotelian argument of the 
Prime Mover as referring to some primitive push, or some rotary motion 
started in the primitive nebula, at the first creation of matter. 
Matter, to Aristotle, to Plato, and to the Greeks generally, is 
eternal, not created. I need hardly add that between an immovable Prime 
Mover and a Personal God a wide gulf intervenes which Aristotle does 
not bridge over. See however Chapter XXIII of this Book.<P> 

The whole idea of a Prime Mover has vanished from modern physics. The 
whole universe, as we know it, is a congeries of sun-and-planet systems 
-- some of them apparently still in process of formation -- arranged 
possibly in the shape of a huge convex lens. These bodies act and react 
on each other. And besides these molar motions there are also molecular 
motions quite as real. The causes of these motions are innumerable 
forces.  The study of them carries us back to consider the 'primitive 
collocation' of the forces of the universe, a collocation whereby they 
were arranged in a 'position of advantage,' so that out of their 
interaction has ensued this orderly world, and in it our earth, fit 
habitation for living things. On this 'primitive collocation,' Father 
B&ouml;dder writes (<i>Natural Theology</i>, p. 56): "Although we have 
nothing to say against the assumption made by astronomers, that our 
cosmic system resulted from the condensation and division of a 
primitive rotating <i>nebula</i>; yet we cannot admit this nebula 
without observing that there must have been a <i>first</i> arrangement 
of the material elements which constituted it, one which already 
contained the present system, or else the said system could never have 
resulted from it.  Now this first arrangement was neither the effect of 
the forces of matter, nor was it essential to matter. . . . Therefore 
if we would explain the origin of that system without violation of 
reason, we are forced to say that its first beginning, nebular or 
otherwise, is due to an intelligent cause." To this effect he adds this 
quotation from Huxley (<i>Life and Letters of Charles Darwin</i>, II, 
201, 202): "The teleological and the mechanical views of nature are 
not, necessarily, mutually exclusive.  On the contrary, the more purely 
a mechanist the speculator is, the more firmly does he assume a 
primordial molecular arrangement of which all the phenomena of the 
universe are consequences, and the more completely is he thereby at the 
mercy of the teleologist, who can always defy him to disprove that this 
primordial molecular arrangement was not intended to evolve the 
phenomena of the universe."<P> 

<i>Omne quod movetur ab alio movetur</i>, I translate "Everything in 
motion is put and kept in motion by another": such is the sense of St 
Thomas and of Aristotle. The <i>ab alio</i> however is not in 
Aristotle. His words are: "Everything in motion must be put and kept in 
motion by something" (<i>Phys.</i> vii, 1); and he adds: "Everything in 
local motion is moved either by itself or by another" (<i>Physics,</i> 
vii, 2) Things that had souls he thought were moved by themselves, and 
especially the heavenly bodies, which were guided by some sort of 
animating soul in perpetual circular motion. St Thomas (B. III, Chap. 
LXXXVII, in the Latin) has his doubts as to the heavenly bodies being 
animated. He considers however (B. III, Chap. LXXXII) "that sublunary 
bodies are ruled by God through the heavenly bodies."<P> 

Taking 'movement' for 'local motion,' the argument of the Prime Mover, 
for a modern mind, resolves itself into the question of 'primitive 
collocation.' Some collocation is presupposed to every mechanical 
problem.  'Why this collocation rather than that?" is a question 
answerable only either by a <i>regressus in infinitum</i> (Q.E.A.) or 
by an invocation of Mind and Design. The argument however may, avail 
itself of a wider meaning of <i>motus</i>, namely, change; and contend 
that, at the back of the changes apparent everywhere, there must he 
some Changeless Being, author and guide of this changing universe. So 
presented, it is sometimes called the 'argument from contingent to 
necessary being.'
