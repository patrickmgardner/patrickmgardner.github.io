<i>Corpora indivisibilia</i>, so the Editions. But the
Bergamo autograph, if we may trust the printers, has
<i>corpora invisibilia</i>. That a body may have accidents
impervious to sense, a microscopic composition quite
other than what appears to the eye, does not seem
usually to have been recognised by the schoolmen.
Their 'accidents' are the sensible phenomena of
bodies. Here again the progress of physics has seriously 
affected metaphysics. The use of reading a
mediaeval book about 'accidents' is to enable you
to understand mediaeval authors and to interpret
mediaeval formularies. But when you have caught
the meaning, it remains for you to apply it to the
ulterior conditions revealed by later science, -- no
easy task.
