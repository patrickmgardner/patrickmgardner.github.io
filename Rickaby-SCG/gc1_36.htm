<H1>That the Propositions which our Understanding forms of God are 
not void of meaning</h1>

FOR all the absolute simplicity of God, not in vain does our 
understanding form propositions concerning Him, putting together and 
putting asunder.<A HREF="gc1_36a.htm">*</a>  For though our 
understanding arrives by way of divers concepts to the knowledge of 
God, still it understands the absolute oneness of the object answering 
to all those concepts. Our mind does not attribute the manner of its 
understanding to the object is understood:<A HREF="gc1_36b.htm">*</a> 
thus it does not attribute immateriality to a stone, though it knows 
the stone immaterially.<A HREF="gc1_36c.htm">*</a>  And therefore it 
asserts unity of the object by an affirmative proposition, which is a 
sign of identity, when it says, 'God is good': in which case any 
diversity that the composition shows is referable to the understanding, 
but unity to the thing understood. And on the same principle sometimes 
our mind forms a statement about God with some mark of diversity by 
inserting a preposition, as when it is said, 'Goodness is in God.' 
Herein is marked a diversity, proper to the understanding; and a unity, 
proper to the thing.
