This merely means that physical causes act
without any definite intention on their part of any
particular results to follow from their action. 
Electrical tension in the air tends to discharge itself in
the form of lightning, but not to kill this particular
man under the tree, although it does kill. The
volcanic <i>nisus</i> prompts to an eruption, but not to
the destruction of such and such a city that is built
over the volcano.  So far as physical agencies are 
concerned, the lava, or flaming gas, takes its 
determined path, neither making for the city, as such,
nor avoiding it, as such.
