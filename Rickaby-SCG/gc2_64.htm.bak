<H1>That the Soul is not a Harmony<A HREF="gc2_64a.htm">*</a></h1>

THE maintainers of this view did not mean that the soul is a harmony of 
sounds, but a harmony of contrary elements, whereof they saw living 
bodies to be composed. The view is rejected for the follow ing 
reasons:<p> 

1. You may find such a harmony in any body, even a mere chemical 
compound (<i>corpus mixtum</i>). A harmony cannot move the body, or 
govern it, or resist the passions, as neither can a temperament. Also a 
harmony, and a temperament also, admits of degrees. All which 
considerations go to show that the soul is neither harmony nor 
temperament.<A HREF="gc2_64b.htm">*</a><p> 

2. The notion of harmony rather befits qualities of the body than the 
soul: thus health is a harmony of humours; strength, of muscles and 
bones; beauty, of limb and colour. But it is impossible to assign any 
components, the harmony of which would make sense, or intellect, or 
other appurtenances of the soul.<p>

3. Harmony may mean either the composition itself or the principle of 
composition. Now the soul is not a composition, because then every part 
of the soul would be composed of certain parts of the body, an 
arrangement which cannot be made out. In like manner the soul is not 
the principle of composition, because to different parts of the body 
there are different principles of composition, or proportions of 
elements, which would require the several parts of the body to have so 
many several souls, -- one soul for bone, one for flesh, one for sinew; 
which is evidently not the case.<p>
