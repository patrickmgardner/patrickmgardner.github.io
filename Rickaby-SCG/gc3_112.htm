<H1>That Rational Creatures are governed by Providence for their own 
sakes, and other Creatures in reference to them<A 
HREF="gc3_112a.htm">*</a></h1>

THE very condition of intellectual nature, whereby it is mistress of its 
own acts, requires the care of Providence, providing for it for its own 
sake: while the condition of other creatures, that have no dominion 
over their own act, indicates that care is taken of them not for 
themselves, but for their subordination to other beings. For what is 
worked by another is in the rank of an instrument: while what works by 
itself is in the rank of a prime agent. Now an instrument is not 
sought for its own sake, but for the use of the prime agent: hence all 
diligence of workmanship applied to instruments must have its end and 
final point of reference in the prime agent. On the other hand all care 
taken about a prime agent, as such, is for its own sake.<p> 

2. What has dominion over its own act, is free in acting. For he is free, 
who is a cause to himself of what he does: whereas a power driven by 
another under necessity to work is subject to slavery. Thus the 
intellectual nature alone is free, while every other creature is 
naturally subject to slavery. But under every government the freemen are 
provided for for their own sakes, while of slaves this care is taken 
that they have being for the use of the free.<p> 

3. In a system making for an end, any parts of the system that cannot 
gain the end of themselves must be subordinate to other parts that do 
gain the end and stand in immediate relation to it. Thus the end of an 
army is victory, which the soldiers gain by their proper act of 
fighting: the soldiers alone are in request in the army for their own 
sakes; all others in other employments in the army, such as grooms or 
armourers, are in request for the sake of the soldiers. But the final 
end of the universe being God, the intellectual nature alone attains 
Him in Himself by knowing Him and loving Him (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_25.htm">XXV</a>). Intelligent nature therefore alone in the 
universe is in request for its own sake, while all other creatures are 
in request for the sake of it.<A HREF="gc3_112b.htm">*</a><p> 

6. Everything is naturally made to behave as it actually does behave 
in the course of nature. Now we find in the actual course of nature 
that an intelligent subsistent being converts all other things to his 
own use, either to the perfection of his intellect, by contemplating 
truth in them, or to the execution of works of his power and development 
of his science, as an artist develops the conception of his art in 
bodily material; or again to the sustenance of his body, united as that 
is to an intellectual soul.<p> 

Nor is it contrary to the conclusion of the aforesaid reasons, that all 
the parts of the universe are subordinate to the perfection of the 
whole. For that subordination means that one serves another: thus there 
is no inconsistency in saying that unintelligent natures serve the 
intelligent, and at the same time serve the perfection of the universe: 
for if those things were wanting which subsistent intelligence requires 
for its perfection, the universe would not be complete.<p> 

By saying that subsistent intelligences are guided by divine providence 
for their own sakes, we do not mean to deny that they are further 
referable to God and to the perfection of the universe. They are cared 
for for their own sakes, and other things for their sake, in this 
sense, that the good things which are given them by divine providence 
are not given them for the profit of any other creature:<A 
HREF="gc3_112c.htm">*</a> while the gifts given to other creatures by 
divine ordinance make for the use of intellectual creatures.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Look not on sun and moon and stars besides, to be 
led astray with delusion and to worship what the Lord thy God hath 
created for the service of all nations under heaven</i> (Deut. iv, 19): 
<i>Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, sheep and all oxen and 
the beasts of the field</i> (Ps. viii, 8).<p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of those who lay it down that it is a sin 
for man to kill dumb animals: for by the natural order of divine 
providence they are referred to the use of man: hence without injustice 
man uses them either by killing them or in any other way: wherefore God 
said to Noe: <i>As green herbs have I given you all flesh</i> (Gen. ix, 
3). Wherever in  Holy Scripture there are found prohibitions of cruelty 
to dumb animals, as in the prohibition of killing the mother-bird with 
the young (Deut. xxii, 6, 7), the object of such prohibition is either 
to turn man's mind away from practising cruelty on his fellow-men, 
lest from practising cruelties on dumb animals one should go on further 
to do the like to men, or because harm done to animals turns to the 
temporal loss of man, either of the author of the harm or of some 
other; or for some ulterior meaning, as the Apostle (1 Cor. ix, 9) 
expounds the precept of not muzzling the treading ox.
