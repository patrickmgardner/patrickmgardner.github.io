<h1>That the Divine Will reaches to the good of Individual Existences</h1>

THE excellence of order in the universe appears in two ways, first, 
inasmuch as the whole universe is referred to something beyond the 
universe, as an army to its leader: secondly, inasmuch as the parts of 
the universe are referred to one another, like the parts of an army; 
and the second order is for the sake of the first. But God, in willing 
Himself as an end, wills other things in their reference to Him as an 
end.  He wills therefore the excellence of order in the universe in 
reference to Himself, and the excellence of order in the universe in 
mutual reference of its parts to one another.  But the excellence of 
order is made up of the good of individual existences.<p> 

This is confirmed by the authority of Scripture: <i>God saw the light, 
that it was good</i> (Gen. i, 4); and similarly of His other works; and 
lastly of them altogether: <i>God saw all things that he had made, and 
they were very good</i> (Gen. i, 31).
