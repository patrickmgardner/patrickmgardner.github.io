<h1>Some Points of Reply to Difficulties on the Resurrection</h1>

IN the first creation of human nature God endowed the human body with 
an attribute over and above what was due to it by the natural 
principles of its constitution, namely, with a certain imperishability, 
to adapt it to its form, that as the life of the soul is perpetual, so 
the body might perpetually live by the soul. Granting that this 
imperishability was not natural in regard of the active principle,<A 
HREF="gc4_81a.htm">*</a> still it may be called natural in regard of the 
end, taking the end of matter to be proportioned to its natural form. 
When then, contrary to the order of its nature, the soul turned away 
from God, there was withdrawn from the body that God-given constitution 
which made it proportionate to the soul; and death ensued. Considering 
then how human nature actually was constituted to begin with, we may 
say that death is something which has accidentally supervened upon man 
through sin. This accident has been removed by Christ, who by the merit 
of His passion and death has destroyed death. Consequently that same 
divine power, which originally endowed the body with incorruption, will 
restore the body again from death to life.<p> 

None of the essential elements in man is altogether annihilated in death.
The rational soul, the 'form' of man, remains after death. The matter also
remains, which was subject to that form. So by the union of numerically
the same soul with numerically the same matter, numerically the same man
will be restored.<A HREF="gc4_81b.htm">*</a><p>

What does not bar numerical unity in a man while he lives on 
uninterruptedly, clearly can be no bar to the identity of the risen man 
with the man that was. In a man's body while he lives, there are not 
always the same parts in respect of matter, but only in respect of 
species. In respect of matter there is a flux and reflux of parts: 
still that fact does not bar the man's numerical unity from the 
beginning to the end of his life. We have an example in a fire, which, 
while it goes on burning, is called numerically one, because its 
species remains, though the wood is burnt out and fresh wood supplied. 
So it is in the human body: for the form and species (kind) of the 
several parts continues unbroken throughout life, but the matter of the 
parts is dissolved by the natural heat, and new matter accrues by 
nourishment. But the man is not numerically different by the difference 
of his component parts at different ages, although it is true that the 
material composition of the man at one stage of his life is not his 
material composition at another. So then, for numerically the same man 
to rise again, it is not requisite for all the material that ever 
entered into his composition throughout the whole course of his life to 
be gathered together and resumed, but just so much of it as suffices to 
make up his proper bulk and stature. We may expect that to be resumed 
by preference, which was more perfect in the species and form of 
humanity.<A HREF="gc4_81c.htm">*</a> If anything was wanting to his due 
stature, either through untimely death or mutilation, divine power will 
supply that from elsewhere. Nor will this supplementary matter mar the 
personal identity of the risen body: for even in the workmanship of 
nature addition is made from without to the stature of a boy without 
prejudice to his identity: for the boy and the adult is numerically the 
same man.<A HREF="gc4_81d.htm">*</a><p> 

The resurrection is natural in respect of its end and term, inasmuch as 
it is natural to the soul to be united to the body: but its efficient 
cause is not any agency of nature, but the divine power alone.<p> 

All men will rise again, though not all have adhered by faith to 
Christ, or have received His Sacraments. For the Son of God assumed 
human nature, in order to restore it: the defect of nature then shall be 
made good in all, inasmuch as all shall return from death to life: but 
the defect shall not be perfectly made good except in such as have 
adhered to Christ, either by their own act believing in Him, or at 
least by the Sacrament of faith.<A HREF="gc4_81e.htm">*</a>
