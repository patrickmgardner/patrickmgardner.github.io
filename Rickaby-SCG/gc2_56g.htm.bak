St Thomas confines this speculation to solids. The diffusion of gases 
and the blending of liquids he would have called, not <i>contactus</i>, 
but perhaps <i>confusio</i>; and that he took to be no real union at 
all. As for the other alternative, <i>mixtio</i>, he has already shown 
that the union of spirit with matter is not that.
