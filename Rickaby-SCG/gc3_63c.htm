<i>Intemperati et incontinentes</i>, the Aristotelian 
<b>akolastoi kai akrateis</b>. "In the intemperate man the
will is inclined to sin by its own choice, that proceeds 
from a habit acquired by custom: whereas in
the incontinent man the will is inclined to sin by
some passion. And because passion quickly passes off;
whereas a habit is a quality difficult to change, it
follows that the incontinent man repents at once,
when the fit of passion is over, which happens not
with the intemperate man: nay, the latter is even
glad to have sinned, because the act of sin by habit
has become connatural to him" (<i>Sum. Theol.</i> 2a 2ae,
q. 156, art. 3: <i>Aquinas Ethicus</i>, II, 339: I, 170, 171).
