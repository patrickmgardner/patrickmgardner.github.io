This is explained by a sentence at the end of
the previous chapter: -- "The bodies of the damned
shall be afflicted by corporeal fire, inasmuch as the
keen quality of that fire is contrary to that equable
bodily structure and harmony, which is connatural
to sense, though it cannot break up the structure:
for such affliction shall not be able to separate the
soul from the body, since the body must ever remain
under the same form." -- The notion is that the soul,
reunited with the body in hell, has such a drastic
hold upon the body that not one bodily atom can be
torn from its place: on the other hand the fire too
takes hold of the same body, and endeavours, as fire
ever will do, to disintegrate and break the body up:
thus over that body a conflict rages between the 
immortal soul and the everlasting fire. And this is the
'contrariety' in question; and in this contrariety,
felt, the agony of hell-fire consists.<p>
