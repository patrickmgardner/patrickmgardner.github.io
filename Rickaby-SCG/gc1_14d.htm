St Thomas passes from 'immovable' to 'immutable.' Aristotle 
(<i>Physics</i>, vii, 2), distinguishes three sorts of 'motion': 'local 
motion' (now the subject matter of dynamics); 'change,' or 'motion in 
quality' (now the matter of chemistry); 'growth and decay,' or 'motion 
in quantity' (matter of biology). Thus three incongruous things were 
labelled with one name, to the prejudice of science for many 
centuries.
