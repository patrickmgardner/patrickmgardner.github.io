<H1>How there is in God a Multitude of Objects of Understanding</h1>

AN external object, coming to be an object of our understanding, does 
not thereby exist in our understanding in its own proper nature: but 
the impression (<i>species</i>) of it must be in our understanding, and 
by that impression our understanding is actualised, or comes actually 
to understand.  The understanding, actualised and 'informed' by such an 
impression, understands the 'thing in itself.' The act of understanding 
is immanent in the mind, and at the same time in relation with the 
thing understood, inasmuch as the aforesaid 'impression,' which is the 
starting-point of the intellectual activity, is a likeness of the thing 
understood.  Thus informed by the impression (<i>species</i>) of the 
thing, the understanding in act goes on to form in itself what we may 
call an 'intellectual expression' (<i>intentio</i>) of the thing. This 
expression is the idea (<i>ratio</i>, <A 
HREF="gc1_53a1.htm"><b>logos</b></a>) of the thing, and so is denoted 
by the definition.  So it must be, for the understanding understands 
alike the thing absent and the thing present; in which respect 
imagination and understanding agree.<A HREF="gc1_53a.htm">*</a> But the 
understanding has this advantage over the imagination, that it 
understands the thing apart from the individualising conditions without 
which the thing exists not <i>in rerum natura</i>. This could not be 
except for the understanding forming to itself the aforesaid 
'expression.' This 'expression' (<i>intentio</i>) in the understanding, 
being, we may say, the term of the intellectual activity, is different 
from the 'intellectual impression' (<i>species intelligibilis</i>), 
which actualises the understanding and which must be considered the 
starting-point of intellectual activity; and yet both the one and the 
other, both the 'impression' (<i>species</i>) and the 'expression' 
(<i>intentio</i>), are likenesses of the 'thing in itself,' which is 
the object of the understanding.  From the fact of the intellectual 
impression, which is the form of the intellect and the starting-point 
of intellectual knowledge, being a likeness of the external thing, it 
follows that the expression, or idea, formed by the understanding, is 
also like the thing: for as an agent is, so are its activities. And 
again, from the fact of the expression, or idea, in the understanding 
being like to its object, it follows that the understanding in the act 
of forming such an idea understands the said object.<P> 

But the divine mind understands by virtue of no impression other than 
its own essence (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_46.htm">XLVI</a>). At the same time 
the divine essence is the likeness of all things. It follows therefore 
that the concept of the divine understanding itself, which is the 
Divine Word, is at once a likeness of God Himself understood, and also 
a likeness of all things whereof the divine essence is a likeness.  
Thus then by one intelligible impression (<i>species 
intelligibilis</i>), which the divine essence, and by one intellectual 
recognition (<i>intentio intellecta</i>), which is the Divine Word, 
many several objects may be understood by God.<A
