St Thomas means: 'If I form a notion of a
thing, and then get a name to express that notion, it
does not follow that the thing, answering to such
name and notion, exists.' St Anselm's disciples reply:
'True of the notions of all other things, as islands or
dollars, which may or may not be; but not true of
the notion of that one thing, whereof existence is a
very part of the notion.' In other words, whereas St
Thomas denies the lawfulness of the transition from
the ideal to the actual order, they maintain that the
transition is lawful in arguing the existence of that
one Being, who is the actuality of all that is ideal.
'But is such actuality possible?' 'It is conceivable,
therefore possible.' 'It may be conceivable, only 
because it is conceived inadequately, without insight
into the inconsistencies which it involves.' 'You have
no right to assume inconsistencies where you discern
none,' rejoins Leibnitz.  And so this 'ontological
argument' will be tossed up and down, as an apple
of discord, to the end.
