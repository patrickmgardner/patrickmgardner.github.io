<H1>That the Potential Intellect of Man is not a Spirit subsisting 
apart from Matter<A HREF="gc2_59a.htm">*</a></h1> 

THERE were others who used another invention in maintaining the point, 
that a subsistent intelligence cannot be united with a body as its 
form. They say that the intellect which Aristotle calls 'potential,' is 
a spiritual being, subsisting apart by itself, and not united with us 
as a form. And this they endeavour to prove from the words of 
Aristotle, who says, speaking of this intellect, that it is "separate, 
unmixed with body, simple and impassible," terms which could not be 
applied to it, they say, if it were the form of a body.<A 
HREF="gc2_59b.htm">*</a> Also from the argument by which Aristotle 
proves that because the potential intellect receives all impressions of 
sensible things, and is in potentiality to them all, it must be devoid 
of all to begin with, as the pupil of the eye, which receives all 
impressions of colours, is devoid of all colour; because if it had of 
itself any colour, that colour would prevent other colours from being 
seen; nay, nothing would be seen except under that colour; and the like 
would be the case of the potential intellect, if it had of itself any 
form or nature of sensible things, as it would have were it the form of 
any body; because, since form and matter make one, the form must 
participate to some extent in the nature of that whereof it is the 
form.<A HREF="gc2_59c.htm">*</a> These passages moved Averroes<A 
HREF="gc2_59d.htm">*</a> to suppose the potential intellect, whereby 
the soul understands, to be separate in being from the body, and not to 
be the form of the body. But because this intellect would have no 
connexion with us, nor should we be able to understand by it unless it 
were somehow united with us, Averroes fixes upon a mode in which it is 
united with us, as he thinks, sufficiently. He says that an impression 
actually made in the understanding is a 'form' of the potential 
intellect, in the same way that an actually visible appearance, as 
such, is a 'form' of the visual faculty; hence out of the potential 
intellect, and this form or impression actually made in the same, there 
results one being. With whatever being therefore this 'form' of the 
understanding is conjoined, the potential intellect is also conjoined 
with that being. But this 'form 'is conjoined with us by means of the 
'phantasm,' or image in the phantasy, which image is a Sort of subject 
receiving in itself that 'form' of understanding.<p>

1. It is easy to see how frivolous and impossible all this construction 
is. For what has understanding is intelligent; and that of which an 
intelligible impression is united with the understanding, is 
understood. The fact that an intelligible impression, united with a 
(foreign) understanding, comes somehow to be in man, will not render 
man intelligent; it will merely make him understood by that separately 
subsisting intelligence.<p> 

2. Besides, the impression actually in understanding is the form of the 
potential intellect, in the same way that the actual visible appearance 
is the form of the visual power, or eye. But the impression actually in 
understanding is to the phantasms as the actual visible appearance is 
to the coloured surface, which is outside the soul. This similitude is 
used by Averroes, as also by Aristotle. Therefore the supposed union of 
the potential intellect (by means of the intelligible form) with the 
phantasm that is in us will resemble the union of the visual power with 
the colour that is in the stone. But this union does not make the stone 
see, but be seen. Therefore the aforesaid union does not make us 
understand, but be understood. But, plainly, it is properly and truly 
said that man understands: for we should not be investigating the 
nature of understanding were it not for the fact that we have 
understanding. The above mode of union then is insufficient.<p> 

3. The intellect in the act of understanding and the object as 
represented in understanding are one, as also the sense in the act of 
sensation and the object as represented in sense. But the understanding 
as apt to understand and its object as open to representation in 
understanding are not one, as neither is sense, so far as it is apt to 
have sensation, one with its object, so far as that is open to be 
represented in sensation.<A HREF="gc2_59e.htm">*</a> The impression 
made by the object, so far as it lies in images of the phantasy, is not 
any representation in the understanding. Only by undergoing a process 
of abstraction from such images does the impression became one with the 
intellect in the act of understanding. In like manner the impression of 
colour is actually felt in sense, not as it is in the stone, but as it 
is in the eye. Now, on the theory of Averroes, the intelligible form, 
or impression in the understanding, only comes to be conjoined with us 
by finding place in the images of our phantasy. Therefore it is not 
conjoined with us inasmuch as it is one with the potential intellect, 
being its form. Therefore it cannot be the medium whereby the potential 
intellect is conjoined with us: because, in so far as it is conjoined 
with the potential intellect, it is not conjoined with us; and in so 
far as it is conjoined with us, it is not conjoined with the potential 
intellect.<p>
