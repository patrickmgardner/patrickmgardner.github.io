The phrase, 'realisation of a species type,' or
'fitness for the species' (<i>congruentia speciei</i>), in this
chapter, points, not the attributes which a man should
have to make him a good man, but the attributes that
he actually has and must have by the fact of his being
a man at all. -- With regard to dogs, horses and other
'educable' animals, who come to possess individual
characteristics of their own, St Thomas would say
that any dog or horse, so born, so bred, so circumstanced, 
would behave just as <i>this</i> or <i>that</i> dog or horse
behaves. Determinists say the same of man: but St
Thomas, not being a determinist, would deny it of
man. Under determinism, all St Thomas's argumentation 
of a special divine providence over each individual 
man falls to the ground. According to St
Thomas, a man using free will is an original, not
merely one of a tribe. Originality is lost in determinism, 
and all true individuality; and no difference
between man and man is left beyond the difference
of one piece of iron hammered into the shape of a
crook and another into the shape of a cross.
