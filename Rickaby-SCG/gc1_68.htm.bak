<H1>That God knows the Motions of the Will</h1>

GOD knows the thoughts of minds and the volitions of hearts in virtue 
of their cause, as He is Himself the universal principle of being. All 
that in any way is, is known by God in His knowledge of His own essence 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc1_49.htm">XLIX</a>). Now there is a certain reality 
in the soul, and again a certain reality in things outside the soul. 
The reality in the soul is that which is in the will or thought.  God 
knows all these varieties of reality.<P> 

3. As God by knowing His own being knows the being of everything,
so by knowing His own act of understanding and will He knows every
thought and volition.<P>

5. God knows intelligent substances not less well than He knows or we 
know sensible substances, seeing that intelligent substances are more 
knowable, as being better actualised. This is confirmed by the 
testimony of Holy Scripture: -- <i>God searcher of hearts and reins</i> 
(Ps. vii, 10): <i>Hell and perdition are before the Lord: how much more 
the hearts of the sons of men?</i> (Prov. xi, 11): <i>He needed not 
that any one should bear testimony of what was in man: for he himself 
knew what was in man</i> (John ii, 25).<P> 

The dominion of the will over its own acts, whereby it has it in its 
power to will and not to will, is inconsistent with will-force being 
determined to one fixed mode of action: it is inconsistent also with 
the violent interference of any external agency; but it is not 
inconsistent with the influence of that Higher Cause, from whence it is 
given to the will both to be and to act.  And thus in the First Cause, 
that is, in God, there remains a causal influence over the motions of 
the will, such that, in knowing Himself, God is able to know these 
motions.<A HREF="gc1_68a.htm">*</a>
