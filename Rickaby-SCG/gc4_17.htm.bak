<H1>That the Holy Ghost is true God</h1>

A TEMPLE is consecrated to none but God: hence it is said: <i>The Lord 
in his holy temple</i> (Ps. x, 5). But there is a temple appointed to 
the Holy Ghost, as it is said: <i>Know ye not that your members are the 
temple of the Holy Ghost?</i> (i Cor. vi, 19.) The Holy Ghost then is 
God, particularly since our members, which the text says are the temple 
of the Holy Ghost, are the members of Christ: for the writer had said 
before: <i>Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?</i> 
(v. 15.) Seeing that Christ is true God, it would be inappropriate for 
the members of Christ to be the temple of the Holy Ghost, unless the 
Holy Ghost were God.<p> 

2. The service of <i>latria</i> (B. III, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_120.htm">CXX</a>) is paid by holy men to God alone (Deut. vi, 
13). But holy men pay that service to the Holy Ghost: for it is said: 
<i>We who serve the Spirit as God (qui spiritui Deo servimus</i>. -- 
Phil. iii, 3). And though some manuscripts have, <i>We who serve in the 
spirit of the Lord (qui spiritu Domini servimus</i> [showing the 
reading <b>Theou</b>]), yet the Greek manuscripts and the more ancient 
Latin ones have, <i>We who serve the Spirit as God (qui spiritui Deo 
servimus</i>); and from the Greek itself [<b>latreuontes</b>] it 
appears that this is to be understood of the service of <i>latria</i>, 
which is due to God alone.<A HREF="gc4_17a.htm">*</a><p> 

3. To sanctify men is a work proper to God: <i>I am the Lord who 
sanctify you</i> (Levit. xxii, 9).  But it is the Holy Ghost who 
sanctifies, according to the words of the Apostle: <i>Ye are washed 
and sanctified and justified, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ 
and in the Spirit of our God</i> (1 Cor. vi, 11).<p> 

4. As the life of the body is by the soul, so the soul's life of 
justice is by God: hence the Lord says: <i>As the living Father hath 
sent me, and I live by the Father, so whosoever eateth me, the same 
shall also live by me</i> (John vi, 58). But such life is by the Holy 
Ghost; hence it is added: <i>It is the Spirit that giveth life</i> 
(John vi, 63): and the Apostle says: <i>If with the spirit ye mortify 
the deeds of the flesh, ye shall live</i> (Rom. viii, 18).<A

7. <i>The Spirit searcheth all things, even the profound things of God. 
For what man knoweth the things of a man but the spirit of man that is 
in him? So the things also that are of God no man knoweth but the 
Spirit of God</i> (1 Cor. ii, 10, 11). But to comprehend all the 
profound things of God is not given to any creature: for no one knoweth 
the Son but the Father, nor doth any one know the Father but the Son 
(Matt. xi, 27); and in the person of God it is said, <i>My secret to 
me</i> (Isai. xxiv, 16). Therefore, the Holy Ghost is, not a 
creature.<p> 

8. According to the above comparison, the Holy Ghost is to God as a 
man's spirit to man. But a man's spirit is intrinsic to man, not of 
a foreign nature, but part of him. Therefore the Holy Ghost is not of 
a nature extrinsic to Deity.<p> 

11. Evidently from Holy Scripture it was God who spoke by the prophets, 
as it is said: <i>I will hear what the Lord God speaketh in me</i> (Ps. 
lxxxiv, 9). But it is equally evident that the Holy Ghost spoke in the 
prophets: <i>The Scripture must be fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost 
foretold by the mouth of David</i> (Acts i, 16). <i>The holy men of God 
spoke, inspired by the Holy Ghost</i> (2 Pet. i, 21). Clearly then the 
Holy Ghost is God.<p> 

17. The Holy Ghost is expressly called God in the text: <i>Ananias, why 
hath Satan tempted thy heart to lie to the Holy Ghost? . . . . Thou hast 
not lied to men, but to God</i> (Acts. v, 3, 4).<p> 

23. <i>Now there are diversities of graces, but the same Spirit. And 
there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord. And there are 
diversities of operations, but the same God, who worketh all in 
all. . . . But all these things one and the same Spirit 
worketh, dividing to every one according as he will</i> (i Cor. xii, 4
5, 6, 11). This text clearly declares the Holy Ghost to be God, as 
well by saying that the Holy Ghost works what it has previously said 
that God works, as also by the declaration of His working according 
to the arbitrement of His own will.<A HREF="gc4_17c.htm">*</a><p>
