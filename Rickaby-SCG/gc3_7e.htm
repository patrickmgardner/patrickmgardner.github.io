The great contradictor of this fundamental
doctrine, -- not to mention Schopenhauer, -- is Buddha
and Buddhism, which makes all conscious thought
as such, an evil, and the grand aim of life to be rid
of it.  Manicheism and Platonism complete the circle,
by making matter evil.  Between evil mind and evil
matter, we may close our philosophy books.
