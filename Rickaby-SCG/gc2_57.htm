<H1>Plato's Theory of the Union of the Intellectual Soul with the 
Body<A HREF="gc2_57a.htm">*</a></h1>

MOVED by these and the like objections, some have said that no 
subsistent intelligence can possibly be the form of a body. But because 
the nature of man of itself seemed to give the lie to this statement, 
inasmuch as man is seen to be composed of an intellectual soul and a 
body, they have thought out various ways to save the nature of man and 
adjust their theory to fact. Plato therefore and his followers laid it 
down that the intellectual soul is not united with the body as form 
with matter, but only as the mover is with the moved, saying that the 
soul is in the body as a sailor in his boat:<A HREF="gc2_57b.htm">*</a> 
thus the union of soul and body would be virtual contact only, of which 
above (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_56.htm">LVI</a>). But as such contact does 
not produce absolute oneness, this statement leads to the awkward 
consequence that man is not absolutely one, nor absolutely a being at 
all, but is a being only accidentally.<A HREF="gc2_57c.htm">*</a> To 
escape this conclusion, Plato laid it down that man is not a compound 
of soul and body, but that the soul using the body is man.<A 
HREF="gc2_57d.htm">*</a> This position is shown to be impossible: for 
things different in being cannot have one and the same activity. I call 
an activity one and the same, not in respect to the effect to which the 
activity is terminated, but as it comes forth from the agent. It is 
true that many men towing a boat make one action in respect of the 
thing done, which is one; but still on the part of the men towing there 
are many actions, as there are many different strains and exertions to 
haul the boat along: for as action is consequent upon form and power, 
it follows that where there are different forms and powers there must 
also be different actions. Now though the soul has a certain proper 
motion of its own, which it performs independently of the body, namely, 
the act of understanding, there are however other activities common to 
soul and body, namely, those of fear, anger, sensation, and the like; 
for these only come about by some change wrought in some definite part 
of the body; hence evidently they are conjoint activities of soul and 
body. Therefore out of soul and body there must result one being, and 
the two cannot be distinct in being.<p> 

But this reasoning may be met by the following reply on behalf of 
Plato's view. -- There is no difficulty, it will be said, in mover and 
moved having the same act, notwithstanding their difference in being: 
for motion is at once the act of the moving force, from which it is, 
and the act of the thing moved, in which it is. Thus then, on Plato's 
theory, the aforesaid activities may be common to soul and body, 
belonging to the soul as the moving force, and to the body as the thing 
moved. But this explanation cannot hold for the following reasons.<p>

1. As the Philosopher proves (<i>De Anima</i>, II), sensation results 
by the sentient subject being moved or impressed by external sensible 
things: hence a man cannot have a sensation without some external 
sensible thing,<A HREF="gc2_57e.htm">*</a> as nothing can be moved 
without a mover. The sensory organ therefore is moved and impressed in 
sensation, but that is by the external sensible object. What receives 
the impression is the sense, as is evident from this, that senseless 
things do not receive any such manner of impression from sensible 
objects. The sense therefore is the passive power of the sensory organ. 
The sentient soul therefore in sensation does not play the part of 
mover and agent, but is that principle in the subject impressed, in 
virtue of which the said subject lies open to the impression. But such 
a principle cannot be different in being from the subject impressed. 
Therefore the sentient soul is not different in being from the animated 
body.<p> 

2. Though motion is the common act of moving force and object moved, 
still it is one activity to impart motion and another to receive 
motion: hence the two several categories of action and passion. If then 
in sensation the sentient soul stands for the agent, and the body for 
the patient, there will be one activity of the soul and another of the 
body. The sentient soul therefore will have an activity and proper 
motion of its own: it will have therefore its own subsistence: 
therefore, when the body perishes, it will not cease to be.<A 
HREF="gc2_57f.htm">*</a> Thus sentient souls, even of irrational 
animals, will be immortal; which seems improbable, although it is not 
out of keeping with Plato's opinion.<A HREF="gc2_57g.htm">*</a> But this 
will be matter of enquiry further on (Chap. LXXXII).<p>

3. A body moved does not take its species according to the power that 
moves it. If therefore the soul is only united to the body as mover to 
moved, the body and its parts do not take their species from the soul: 
therefore, when the soul departs, the body and the parts thereof will 
remain of the same species. But this is manifestly false: for flesh and 
bone and hands and such parts, after the departure of the soul, do not 
retain their own names except by a <i>fa&ccedil;on de parler</i>;<A 
HREF="gc2_57h.htm">*</a> since none of these parts retains its proper 
activity, and activity follows species. Therefore the union of soul and 
body is not that of mover with moved, or of a man with his dress.<p>

6. If the soul is united with the body only as mover with moved, it 
will be in the power of the soul to go out of the body when it wishes, 
and, when it wishes, to reunite itself with the body.<A 
HREF="gc2_57i.htm">*</a>  That the soul is united with the body as the 
proper form of the same, is thus proved. That whereby a thing emerges 
from potential to actual being, is its form and actuality. But by the 
soul the body emerges from potentiality to actuality: for the being of 
a living thing is its life: moreover the seed before animation is only 
potentially alive, and by the soul it is made actually alive:<A 
HREF="gc2_57j.htm">*</a> the soul therefore is the form of the animated 
body.  Again: as part is to part, so is the whole sentient soul to the 
whole body. But sight is the form and actuality of the eye:<A 
HREF="gc2_57k.htm">*</a> therefore the soul is the form and actuality of 
the body.<p>
