<h1>That Souls enter upon Punishment or Reward immediately after their 
Separation from their Bodies</h1>

THERE can be no reason for deferring reward or punishment beyond
the time at which the soul is first capable of receiving either the
one or the other, that is, as soon as it leaves the body.<p>

2. In this life is the state of merit and demerit: hence the present 
life is compared to a warfare and to the days of a hired labourer: 
<i>Man's life is a warfare upon the earth, and his days as those of a 
day-labourer</i> (Job vii, 1). But when the state of warfare is over, or 
the labour of a man hired for the day, then reward or punishment is due 
at once, according as men have acquitted themselves well or ill in the 
effort: hence it is said: <i>The reward of thy hired labourer shall not 
rest with thee till morning</i> (Levit. xix, 13).<p> 

3. The order of punishment and reward follows that of offence and 
merit. Now it is only through the soul that merit and demerit appertain 
to the body: for nothing is meritorious or demeritorious except for 
being voluntary. Therefore reward and punishment properly pass from the 
soul to the body, not to the soul for the body's sake. There is no 
reason therefore why the resumption of bodies should be waited for in 
the punishing or rewarding of souls: nay, it seems fitting rather that 
souls, in which fault or merit had a prior place, should have a 
priority likewise of punishment or reward.<p> 

Hereby is refuted the error of sundry Greeks, who say that before the 
resurrection of their bodies souls neither mount up to heaven nor are 
plunged into hell.<A HREF="gc4_91a.htm">*</a><p> 

But we must observe that there may be some impediment on the part of 
the good in the way of their souls receiving their final reward in the 
vision of God immediately upon their departure from the body. To that 
vision, transcending as it does all natural created capacity, the 
creature cannot be raised before it is entirely purified: hence it is 
said that <i>nothing defiled can enter into it</i> (Wisd. vii, 25), and 
that <i>the polluted shall not pass through it</i> (Isai. xxxv, 8). Now 
the pollution of the soul is by sin, which is an inordinate union with 
lower things: from which pollution it is purified in this life by 
Penance and other Sacraments. Now it happens sometimes that this 
process of purification is not entirely accomplished in this life; and 
the offender remains still a debtor with a debt of punishment upon 
him, owing to some negligence, or distraction, or to death overtaking 
him before his debt is paid. Not for this does he deserve to be 
entirely shut out from reward: because all this may happen without 
mortal sin; and it is only mortal sin that occasions the loss of 
charity, to which the reward of life everlasting is due. Such persons 
then must be cleansed in the next life, before entering upon their 
eternal reward. This cleansing is done by penal inflictions, as even in 
this life it might have been completed by penal works of satisfaction: 
otherwise the negligent would be better off than the careful, if the 
penalty that men do not pay here for their sins is not to be undergone 
by them in the life to come. The souls then of the good, who have upon 
them in this world something that needs cleansing, are kept back from 
their reward, while they endure cleansing purgatorial pains. And this 
is the reason why we posit a purgatory, or place of cleansing.
