This distinction of actuality and potentiality is
the saving of philosophy. Even physical science in our
day has found 'potential' a convenient term.  The
distinction is heedlessly abolished by those who put
activity for being, and seem to think that the human
mind itself would perish the moment it ceased to
act, as though there could be no reality that was not
actualised. But perfect actuality can be nothing less
than God: so that if actuality alone exists without
potentiality, God alone exists.  Nature by the institution 
of sleep teaches us to distinguish the potential
from the actual. If mind may be dormant and yet
not cease to be, so may the objects of mind be dormant -- 
unobserved by human sense, unpictured in
human imagination, unrecalled in human memory,
or even wholly out of the ken of human knowledge,
-- and still really and truly be, as "permanent 
possibilities of sensation" or of cognition.  This phrase of
J.S. Mill is felicitous, if we remember, as he did
not, that a "permanent possibility" is something
raised above nothingness. Here then we have the
confutation of idealism, of Berkeley and Kant and
all their tribe. Phenomena, or appearances, cannot
be actual to man except as objects of sensation or
other human cognition: but they may very well be
and are potential, observable though unobserved, out
of all human mind. Potentiality however cannot be
mere potentiality: it must rest on something actual.
The actuality on which potential phenomena, appearances 
or accidents rest, is <I>the substance in which
they inhere.</i><P>

The horns then of idealism are broken. <i>Subject</i>
is not <i>percipere</i>; <i>object</i> is not 
<i>percipi</i>.  If any one claims
the liberty of using such a terminology, he must at
least be brought to an admission that there is much
of Mind which is not <i>subject</i> in his sense, and much
of Matter that is not <i>object</i>. Mind and Matter are
like sea and land, two vast potentialities. They meet
on the coast-line: but the coast-line of <i>percipere</i> and
<i>percipi</i> is far from being the whole reality.
