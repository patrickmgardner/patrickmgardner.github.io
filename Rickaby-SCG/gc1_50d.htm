This is an important principle, often laid down
as follows: -- God knows His own nature in all the
various modes in which that nature can be copied
outside Himself In knowing this, He knows the
ideal order, every detail and all inter-relations of
details in any possible universe. This is called the
<i>knowledge of simple understanding</i>, inasmuch as it is the
knowledge of all creatable creatures and their 
ongoings, antecedent to and apart from the creation
and actual existence of any: this knowledge 
however dwells only in the ideal order of possibilities,
and may therefore be called general and universal,
though not abstract, inasmuch as it deals with types
of individual things, but not with particular 
existences <i>in rerum natura</i> as actually existing, but only
as potentialities. God further knows things outside
Himself as they actually and individually exist, 
inasmuch as all things are of His causation and creation,
and exist and act under His will and power. He
knows them by insight of Himself, not as He is
a mere nature, but as He is a nature willing to create
on these particular lines. This knowledge of the
universe as the universe actually is for all time, is
called the <i>knowledge of vision</i>. For these two 
knowledges sec Chap. LXVI. The knowledge of simple
understanding is not abstract, inasmuch as God knows,
not only types of species, but types of different 
individuals possible in each species; and all these several
types He knows, not by so many several ideas, but in
the one act by which He knows Himself.
