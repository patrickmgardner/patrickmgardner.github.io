<H1>In what the Good of Poverty consists</h1>

LET us observe in riches what is to be thought of poverty. Exterior 
riches are necessary to the good of virtue inasmuch as by them we 
support the body and succour other people. Means to an end must derive 
their goodness from the end. Exterior riches therefore must be some sort 
of a good to man, still not a principal but a secondary good: for the 
principal good is the end, -- other things are good as subordinate to 
the end. Therefore it has been held that the virtues are the greatest of 
good things to man, and exterior riches the least. Now the means to any 
end must be checked by the requirements of that end.<A 
HREF="gc3_134a.htm">*</a> Riches therefore are so far forth good as they 
make for the exercise of virtue. But if that measure is exceeded, and 
the exercise of virtue impeded by them, they are no longer to be counted 
among good but among evil things. Hence it comes about that the 
possession of riches is a good thing for some men, who turn them to a 
virtuous use; and an evil thing for other men, who thereby are withdrawn 
from virtue, either by excessive solicitude or excessive affection for 
their wealth, or by elation of mind thence arising.<p> 

But there are virtues of the active life and virtues of the 
contemplative life; and these two orders of virtues make use of riches 
in different ways. The contemplative virtues need riches solely for the 
sustenance of nature:<A HREF="gc3_134b.htm">*</a> the active virtues as 
well for this purpose as also for the further purpose of helping a 
neighbour. Hence the contemplative life is more perfect in this, that it 
requires fewer earthly aids, its attention being wholly given to divine 
things. Hence the Apostle says: <i>Having food, and wherewith to be 
clothed, with these let us be content</i> (1 Tim. vi, 8).<p> 

Poverty then is praiseworthy, inasmuch as it delivers a man from the 
vices in which some men are entangled by riches. Again, inasmuch as it 
removes the solicitude that goes with wealth, it is useful to some 
persons, namely, to those who have the gift of occupying themselves with 
better things; but hurtful to others, who, set free from this 
solicitude, busy themselves about worse things.<A 
HREF="gc3_134c.htm">*</a> But in so far as poverty takes away the good 
that comes of riches, namely, the helping of other people, and hinders 
self support, it is simply an evil, except in so far as the loss of the 
power of helping neighbours in temporals may be compensated by the 
advantage of a free attention to divine and spiritual things. But the 
good of one's own subsistence is so necessary, that the lack of it can 
be compensated by no other good: for on the offer of no other good 
should a man deprive himself of the means of supporting his own life. 
Poverty therefore is praiseworthy, when it delivers a man from earthly 
cares, and he thereby arrives to give his mind more freely to divine and 
spiritual things, yet so that he retains the means of lawful self-
support, whereunto not much provision is requisite. And the less 
solicitude any method of poverty involves, the more praiseworthy is that 
poverty. But poverty is not more praiseworthy, the greater it is:<A 
HREF="gc3_134d.htm">*</a> for poverty is not good in itself, but only 
inasmuch as it removes from a man's path the obstacles of his freely 
applying himself to spiritual things: hence the measure of such removal 
of obstacles is the measure of the goodness of poverty. And this is a 
general principle with respect to all creatures: they are good only in so 
far as they lead to virtue, not in themselves.<A HREF="gc3_134e.htm">*</a>
