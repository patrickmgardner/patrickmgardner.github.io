<h1>Of the kind of Bread and Wine that ought to be used for the 
Consecration of this Sacrament</h1>

THOSE conditions must be observed which are essential for bread and 
wine to be. That alone is called wine, which is liquor pressed out of 
grapes:<A HREF="gc4_69a.htm">*</a> nor is that properly called bread, 
which is not made of grains of wheat. Substitutes for wheaten bread 
have come into use, and have got the name of bread; and similarly other 
liquors have come into use as wine: but of no such bread other than 
bread properly so called, or wine other than what is properly called 
wine, could this Sacrament possibly be consecrated: nor again if the 
bread and wine were so adulterated with foreign matter as that the 
species should disappear. A valid Sacrament may be consecrated 
irrespectively of varieties of bread and wine, when the varieties are 
accidental, not essential. The alternative of leavened or unleavened 
bread is an instance of such accidental variety; and therefore 
different churches have different uses in this respect; and either use 
may be accommodated to the signification of the Sacrament. Thus as 
Gregory says in the Register of his Letters<A HREF="gc4_69b.htm">*</a>: 
"The Roman Church offers unleavened bread, because the Lord took flesh 
without intercourse of the sexes: but other Churches offer leavened 
bread, because the Word of the Father, clothed in flesh, is at once 
true God and true man." Still the use of unleavened bread is the more 
congruous, as better representing the purity of Christ's mystical Body, 
the Church, which is figured in a secondary way (<i>configuratur</i>) 
in this Sacrament, as the text has it: <i>Christ our passover is 
sacrificed: therefore let us feast in the unleavened bread of sincerity 
and truth</i> (1 Cor. v, 7, 8).<p> 

This shuts out the error of some heretics who say that this Sacrament 
cannot be celebrated in unleavened bread: a position plainly upset by 
the authority of the gospel, where we read (Matt. xxvi, 17: Mark xiv, 
12: cf. Luke xxii, 7) that the Lord ate the passover with His 
disciples, and instituted this Sacrament, <i>on the first day of the 
azymes</i>, at which time it was unlawful for leavened bread to be found 
in the houses of the Jews (Exod. xii, 15); and the Lord, so long as He 
was in the world, observed the law. It is foolish then to blame in the 
use of the Latin Church an observance which the Lord Himself adhered to 
in the very institution of this Sacrament.<A HREF="gc4_69c.htm">*</a>
