Cf. <i>Aquinas Ethicus</i> I, pp. 209, 213, 256, 346,
347: II, 367. As we speak of the 'orientation' of
churches,  we might call this <i>deordinatis mentis</i> a
'deorientation,' the soul no longer looking towards
its First Beginning. Under this head, as will be seen,
St Thomas includes the privation of charity, which is
the principal loss incurred by mortal sin. Throughout
this chapter the sin spoken of is mortal sin.
