The argument is this. -- The Church is one society, as it is one 
Church, cf. Ephesians iv, 4-6: v, 23-31: John x, 16). But there is one 
society only where there is one government; and one government means 
one sovereign authority (this is an axiom of political science). Is 
that authority vested in many persons collectively or in one person? We 
may suppose that the government of the whole Church is analogous to the 
government of those local Churches, which are called dioceses. But a 
diocese is governed by one person, the Bishop: therefore the whole 
Church by one Bishop, supreme over other Bishops. For the value of the 
argument, cf. <A HREF="gc4_76a.htm">note [4.76a]</a>. The conclusion is 
finally evinced <i>a posteriori</i> by documents and facts of history.
