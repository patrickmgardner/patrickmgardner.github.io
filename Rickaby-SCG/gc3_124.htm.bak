<H1>That Marriage ought to be between one Man and one Woman</h1>

ONE general reason holds for all animals, which is this, that every 
animal desires free enjoyment of the pleasure of sexual union as of 
eating: which freedom is impeded by there being either several males to 
one female, or the other way about: and therefore animals fight alike 
for food and for sexual jealousy. But in men there is a special reason, 
inasmuch as man naturally desires to be sure of his own offspring. But 
here a difference comes in. Both of the above mentioned reasons hold 
for the case of the cohabitation of one female with several males: but 
the second reason does not hold against the cohabitation of one male 
with several females, -- I mean certainty in point of parentage is not 
in that case prevented. But the first reason makes against it: for as 
the free enjoyment of the female is taken from the male, if the female 
has another partner, so the same free enjoyment is taken from the 
female, if the male has more than one partner.<p> 

2. In every species of animal in which the sire takes any interest in 
the offspring, one male keeps company with one female only, as in all 
birds that rear their young in common: for one male could not avail for 
several females as a helper in the rearing of their progeny: whereas in 
animals in which the males take no interest in the offspring, one male 
consorts with several females promiscuously, and the female with 
several males, as appears in dogs, poultry, and the like.<A 
HREF="gc3_124a.htm">*</a> But the male's interest in the offspring is 
greater in the human species than in any other.<A 
HREF="gc3_124b.htm">*</a><p> 

3 and 4. The reason why a wife is not allowed more than one husband at 
a time is because otherwise paternity would be uncertain. If then while 
the wife has one husband only, the husband has more than one wife, 
there will not be a friendship of equality on both sides, friendship 
consisting in a certain equality. There will not be the friendship of a 
free man with a free woman, but a sort of friendship of a slave with 
her master. The husband might well be allowed a plurality of wives, if 
the understanding were allowable, that the friendship of each with him 
was not to be that of a free woman with a free man but of a slave with 
her master. And this is borne out by experience: for among men that 
keep many wives the wives are counted as menials.<p> 

5. From one man having several wives there arises discord at the 
domestic hearth, as experience shows.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>They shall be two in one flesh</i> (Gen. ii, 24).
