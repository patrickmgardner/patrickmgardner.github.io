The presence of a dear friend as a guest at my table is to me an object 
at once of <i>will</i> and of <i>intention</i>. The presence of a 
stranger who accompanies my friend, and without whom my friend would 
not have come, is to me an object of <i>will</i>, but not of 
<i>intention</i>.  I should not have invited that gentleman by himself.  
<i>Volition</i> then extends to three acts. -- <ul>

<li>(a) <i>Intention</i>, <b>boul&ecirc;sis</b> (<i>Eth. Nic.</i> III, 
iv, 7-9), of the <i>end</i> willed for its own sake: observe, this use 
is quite apart from the distinction made in English philosophy between 
<i>intention</i> and <i>motive</i>. 

<li>(b) <i>Choice</i>, <b>proairesis</b> (<i>Eth. Nic.</i> III, iv, 9) 
of <i>means</i> to the end. 

<li>(c) <i>Acceptance</i> of circumstances attached to the end, or more 
usually to the means, but not in themselves regarded either as 
<i>good</i>, as in the <i>end</i>, or <i>useful</i>, as in the 
<i>means</i>.<p>

I have endeavoured to bring out the practical importance of these 
distinction in my <i>Ethics and Natural Law</i>, pp. 31-35, 203-208, 
222-224.
