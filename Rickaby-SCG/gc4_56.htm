<h1>Of the Need of Sacraments</h1>

THE death of Christ is the universal cause of man's salvation: but a 
universal cause has to be applied to particular effects. Thus it was 
found necessary for certain remedies to be administered to men by way 
of bringing Christ's death into proximate connexion with them. Such 
remedies are the Sacraments of the Church. And these remedies had to be 
administered with certain visible signs: -- first, because God provides 
for man, as for other beings, according to his condition; and it is the 
condition of man's nature to be led through sensible things to things 
spiritual and intelligible: secondly, because instruments must be 
proportioned to the prime cause; and the prime and universal cause of 
man's salvation is the Word Incarnate: it was convenient therefore 
that the remedies, through which that universal cause reaches men, 
should resemble the cause in this, that divine power works invisibly 
through visible signs.<p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of certain heretics, who wish all visible
sacramental signs swept away; and no wonder, for they take all visible things
to be of their own nature evil, and the work of an evil author (B. III,
Chap. <A HREF="gc3_15.htm">XV</a>).<A HREF="gc4_56a.htm">*</a><p>

These visible sacramental signs are the instruments of a God Incarnate
and Crucified (<i>instrumenta Dei incarnati et passi</i>).
