<H1>Of the Subordination of Men one to another</h1>

SINCE man is endowed with understanding and sense and bodily power, 
these faculties are arranged in order in him by the disposition of 
divine providence according to the plan of the order that obtains in 
the universe, bodily power being put under that of sense and intellect 
as carrying out their command, and the sentient faculty itself under 
the faculty of intellect. And similar is the order between man and man. 
Men pre-eminent in understanding naturally take the command; while men 
poor in understanding, but of great bodily strength, seem by nature 
designate for servants, as Aristotle says in his <i>Politics</i>,<A 
HREF="gc3_81a.htm">*</a> with whom Solomon is of one mind, saying: 
<i>The fool shall serve the wise</i> (Prov. xi, 29). But as in the 
works of one man disorder is born of intellect following sense, so in 
the commonwealth the like disorder ensues where the ruler holds his 
place, not by pre-eminence of understanding, but by usurpation of 
bodily strength, or is brought into power by some burst of passion. Nor 
is Solomon silent upon this disorder: <i>There is an evil that I have 
seen under the sun, a fool set in high estate</i> (Eccles x, 5, 6). But 
even such an anomaly does not carry with it the entire perversion of 
the natural order: for the dominion of fools is weak, unless 
strengthened by the counsel of the wise. Hence it is said: <i>A wise 
man is strong, and a knowing man stout and valiant: because war is 
managed by due ordering, and there shall be safety where there are many 
counsels</i> (Prov. xxiv, 5, 6). And because he who gives counsel rules 
him who takes it, and becomes in a manner his master, it is said: <i>A 
wise servant shall be master over foolish sons</i> (Prov. xvii, 2).
