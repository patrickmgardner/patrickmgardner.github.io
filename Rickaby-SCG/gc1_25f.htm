<i>Being</i> means anything and everything that in
any way <i>is</i>, and can at all be said to be removed
from the merest nothing.  There is <i>being in 
thought</i>, <i>conceptual</i>, or <i>ideal being</i>; 
and there is <i>being of thing, -- actually existent being.  
Being</i> in this latter sense of 
<i>what actually exists</i> cannot be a genus, because the
whole apparatus of genus, species and differentia 
belongs to the business of definition; and definition
does not lay down actual existence (<i>esse</i>), but ideal
being (<i>essentia</i>.  It is no part of the definition of a
triangle to state that any such things as triangles do
actually exist. Therefore we read in this chapter
(n. 3): "The existence of each thing that exists in
a genus is something over and above the quiddity of
the genus." In other words, 'existence' lies outside
every possible generic notion. Nor again can <i>being</i>
in the sense of <i>what is in thought be a genus</i>, because
such conceptual being penetrates and pervades the
whole ideal order, to which genus, species and 
differentia belong: it is the fundamental notion of the
order, and appears everywhere, and therefore cannot
be screened off as a genus. -- See <i>Metaphysics</i> in the
Stonyhurst Series of "Manuals of Catholic 
Philosophy," pp. 35-38.
