<H1>That he who falls from Grace by Sin may be recovered again by 
Grace</h1>

IT belongs to the same power to continue and to repair after 
interruption, as is the case with the powers of nature in regard of 
bodily health. But man perseveres in good by the aid of divine grace: 
therefore, if he has fallen by sin, he may be recovered by help of the 
same grace.<A HREF="gc3_157a.htm">*</a><p> 

 2. An agent that requires no predisposition of its subject, can 
imprint its effect on its subject, howsoever disposed. But God, 
requiring no predisposition of the subject of His action, when the 
subject is corporeal, -- as when He gives sight to the blind, or raises 
the dead to life, -- does not require any previous merit either in the 
will for the conferring of His grace, which is given without merits 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc3_149.htm">CXLIX</a>). Therefore even after a man has 
fallen from grace by sin, God can confer on him the grace that puts the 
recipient in the state of grace, whereby sins are taken away.<p> 

5. In the works of God there is nothing in vain, as neither in the 
works of nature, for nature has this prerogative of God. Now it would 
be in vain for anything to move with no chance of arriving at its term. 
Whatever naturally moves to a certain end, must be somehow competent to 
get there.<A HREF="gc3_157b.htm">*</a> But after a man has fallen into 
sin, so long as the state of this life lasts, there remains in him an 
aptitude of being moved to good, shown by such signs as desire of good 
and grief at evil. Therefore there is some possibility of his return to 
good.<p> 

6. There exists in nature no potentiality, which cannot be reduced to 
act by some natural active power. Much less is there in the human soul 
any potentiality, which is not reducible to act by the active power of 
God. But even after sin there still remains in the human soul a 
potentiality of good, because the natural powers, whereby the soul is 
related to its proper good, are not taken away by sin.<p> 

Therefore it is said: <i>Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be 
made white as Snow</i> (Isai. i, 18): <i>Charity covereth all sins</i> 
(Prov. x, 12). Nor do we ask of the Lord in vain, <i>Forgive us our 
trespasses</i>.<p> 

Hereby is refuted the error of the Novatians, who said that man cannot 
obtain pardon for sins committed after baptism.<A HREF="gc3_157c.htm">*</a>
