The term <i>right</i> may be taken in two senses: (1) as the 
contradictory of <i>wrong</i>, thus it means not <i>wrong</i>, but 
<i>permissible</i>. So it is right to wear a red waistcoat. Positive 
laws can command nothing which is not right to begin with, in this 
sense. (2) <i>Right</i> may mean <i>requisite, incumbent</i> upon human 
nature as such, and <i>requiring to be made obligatory upon all</i>, 
e.g., sobriety and the payment of debts. This sense of <i>right</i> 
includes the former sense and adds to it. The law commanding such right 
is not called <i>positive</i> but <i>natural</i> law. St Thomas calls 
it <i>divine</i> law, meaning the natural law as revealed. <i>Right</i> 
in this chapter is <i>right</i> in the second sense of the term.
