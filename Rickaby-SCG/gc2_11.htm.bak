<H1>That something is predicated of God in relation to Creatures</h1> 

Since power is proper to God in respect of the effects of His 
production, and power ranks as a principle, and a principle is so 
called in relation to its derivative; it is clear that something may be 
predicated of God in relation to the effects of His production.<p> 

2. It is unintelligible how one thing can be made a subject of 
predication in relation to another thing, unless contrariwise the other 
thing be made a subject of predication in relation to it. But other 
beings are made subjects of predication in relation to God, as when it 
is said that they have their being from God and depend on Him. God 
therefore must be made a subject of predication in relation to 
creatures.<p> 

3. Likeness is a relation. But God, as other agents, acts to the 
production of His own likeness.<p> 

4. Knowledge is predicated in relation to the thing known. But God has 
knowledge of other beings.<p> 

5. Whatever is first and sovereign, is so in relation to others, But 
God is the first being and the sovereign good.<p>
