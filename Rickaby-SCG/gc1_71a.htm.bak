Evil is not knowable by itself, because it is of the essence of evil to 
be a privation of good; and thus it can neither be defined nor known 
except through good" (<i>Sum. Theol.</i>, I, q. 14, art. 10, ad 4).<P>

"Vinegar and oil," as Aeschylus says (<i>Agam</i>. 322-3), "poured into 
the same vessel, stand apart in unfriendly separation." But in the 
vessel of the mind contraries do not indeed blend, but stand together, 
and even call for one another's presence, as elements mutually 
complementary. Thus, though darkness excludes light, and good evil, the 
idea of darkness is complementary to that of light, and the idea of 
evil complementary to that of good. This difference between the ideal 
and the actual order, that in actuality, contraries are mutually 
exclusive, while as thoughts they are mutually complementary, I do not 
remember to have seen noticed elsewhere.
