<H1>That the Variety of Creatures does not arise from any Contrariety 
of Prime Agents<A HREF="gc2_41a.htm">*</a></h1>

IF the diversity of things proceeds from diversity or contrariety of 
diverse agents, this would seem to hold especially of the contrariety 
of good and evil, so that all good things should proceed from a good 
principle, and evils from an evil principle. Now there is good and evil 
in all genera. But there cannot be one first principle of all evils: 
for the very essence of such a principle would be evil, and that is 
impossible. Everything that is, inasmuch as it is a being, must 
necessarily be good: for it loves and strives to preserve its own 
being, a sign whereof is this fact, that everything fights against its 
own destruction: now what all things seek is good. It is impossible 
therefore for the diversity of things to arise from two principles, one 
good and one evil.<A HREF="gc2_41b.htm">*</a><p> 

9. What in no manner of way is, is neither good nor evil: while every 
thing that is, in so far as it is, is good. A thing can be evil 
therefore only inasmuch as it is not-being, that is, <i>privative</i> 
being;<A HREF="gc2_41c.htm">*</a> and the evil is precisely the 
privation. Now privation never comes of the ordinary action of any 
cause: because every cause acts inasmuch as it is endowed with 'form'; 
and thus the ordinary effect of its action must also be endowed with 
'form,' since every agent acts to the production of its own likeness, 
unless it be accidentally hindered. It follows that evil does not come 
of the ordinary action of any cause, but is accidentally incident among 
the effects of ordinary causation.<A HREF="gc2_41d.htm">*</a>  There is 
therefore no one primary and essential principle of all evil: but the 
first principle of all is one primary good, among the effects of which 
there ensues evil incidentally.<p>

Hence it is said: <i>I am the Lord, and there is none other, forming 
light and creating darkness, making peace and creating evil: I am the 
Lord doing all these things</i> (Isa. xlv, 6, 7). And, <i>Good things 
and evil things, life and death, poverty and rank are from God</i> 
(Ecclus xi, 14). And, <i>Against evil is good, and against life death; 
so against the just man is the sinner. And so behold all the works of 
the Most High, two and two, and one against one</i> (Ecclus xxxiii, 
15).<p>  

God is said to make and create evil things, inasmuch as He creates 
things that are good in themselves and yet hurtful to others: thus the 
wolf, though a good thing naturally in his kind, is evil to the sheep. 
Hence it is said: <i>Shall there be evil in the city that the Lord hath 
not done?</i> (Amos iii, 6.)<p>  

Hereby is excluded the error of those who suppose two primitive 
contrary principles, good and evil. This error of the early 
philosophers some evil-minded men have presumed to introduce into 
Christian teaching, the first of whom was Marcion, and afterwards the 
Manicheans, who have done most to spread this error.<p>
