<H1>How in the Production of a Creature there may be found a debt of 
Justice in respect of the necessary Sequence of something posterior 
upon something prior</h1> 

I SPEAK here of what is prior, not in order of time merely, but by 
nature.  The debt is not absolute, but conditional, of the form: 'If 
this is to be, this  must go before.'  According to this necessity a 
triple debt is found in the production of creatures. First, when the 
conditional proceeds from the whole universe of things to some 
particular part requisite for the perfection of the universe. Thus, if 
God willed the universe to be such as it is, it was due that He should 
make the sun and water and the like, without which the universe cannot 
be.<A HREF="gc2_29a.htm">*</a>  Second, when the conditional proceeds 
from one creature to another. Thus, if God willed man to be, He was 
obliged to make plants and animals and such like, which man needs to 
his perfect being: though God has made both the one and the other out 
of His mere will. Third, when the conditional proceeds from the 
existence of the individual creature to its parts and properties and 
accidents, on which the creature depends for its being or perfection. 
Thus, supposing that God wished to make man, it was due, on this 
supposition, that He should unite in him soul and body, senses, and 
other appurtenances, intrinsic and extrinsic. In all these matters, 
rightly considered, God is not said to be a debtor to the creature, but 
a debtor to the fulfilment of His own plan.  On these explanations of 
the meaning of the term 'debt' and 'due,' natural justice is found in 
the universe both in respect of the creation of things and in respect 
of their propagation; and therefore God is said to have established and 
to govern all things justly and reasonably. Thus then is shut out a 
two-fold error: on the one hand of those who would limit the divine 
power, saying that God can do only as He does, because so He is bound 
to do; on the other, of those who say that all things follow on His 
sheer will, and that no other reason is to be sought or assigned in 
creation than that God wills it so.<p>
