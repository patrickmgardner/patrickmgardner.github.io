<H1>That it is not impossible for the Potential and the Active 
Intellect to be united in the one Substance of the Soul</h1> 

SOME one perhaps may think it impossible for one and the same 
substance, that of our soul, to be in potentiality to receive all 
intellectual impressions (which is the function of the potential 
intellect), and to actualise those impressions (which is the function 
of the active intellect); since nothing acts as it is in potentiality 
to receive, but only as it is in actual readiness to act. But, looking 
at the matter rightly, no inconvenience or difficulty will be found in 
this view of the union of the active and potential intellect in the one 
substance of the soul.  For a thing may well be in potentiality in one 
respect and in actuality in another; and this we find to be the 
condition of the intellectual soul in its relation to phantasms, or 
impressions in phantasy. For the intellectual soul has something in 
actuality, to which the phantasm is in potentiality;<A 
HREF="gc2_77a.htm>*</a> and on the other hand the intellectual soul is 
in potentiality to that which is actually found in the phantasms.<A 
HREF="gc2_77b.htm>*</a> For the substance of the human soul has the 
attribute of immateriality: but it is not thereby assimilated to this 
or that definite thing; and yet such assimilation is requisite for our 
soul to know this or that thing definitely, since all cognition takes 
place by some likeness of the object known being stamped on the knowing 
mind.<A HREF="gc2_77c.htm>*</a> Thus then the intellectual soul remains 
in potentiality, open to the reception of definite impressions in the 
likeness of things that come within our observation and knowledge, 
which are the natures of sensible things. These definite natures of 
sensible things are represented to us by phantasms, which however have 
not yet reached the stage of being objects of intellect, seeing that 
they are likenesses of sensible things under material conditions, which 
are individualising properties, -- and besides they are in bodily 
organs. They are therefore not actual objects of understanding; and yet 
since in the case of this man [or other sensible object], whose 
likeness is represented by phantasms, it is possible to fix upon a 
universal nature stripped of all individualising conditions, these 
phantasms are potentially intelligible. Thus then they have a 
potentially intelligible being, but an actually definite likeness to 
things, whereas in the intellectual soul, as we saw, the situation was 
the other way about. There is then in the intellectual soul a power 
exercising its activity upon phantasms, making them actual objects of 
understanding; and this power of the soul is called the active 
intellect. There is also in the soul a power that is potentially open 
to definite impressions of sensible things; and this power is the 
potential intellect.<p> 

But the intellectual soul does not lie open to receive impressions of 
the likenesses of things that are in phantasms in the way that the 
likeness exists in the phantasm, but according as those likenesses are 
raised to a higher stage, by being abstracted from  individualising 
material conditions and rendered actual objects, or terms, of 
understanding. And therefore the action of the active intellect upon 
the phantasms precedes their being received into the potential 
intellect; and thus the prime agency is not attributable to the 
phantasms, but to the active intellect.<p> 

There are some animals that see better by night than by day, because 
they have weak eyes, which are stimulated by a little light, but 
dazzled by much. And the case is similar with our understanding, which 
is "to the clearest truths as the bat's eye to the sun" (Aristotle, 
<i>Metaph.</i> I, Appendix): hence the little intellectual light that 
is connatural to us is sufficient for us to understand with. But that 
the intellectual light connatural to our soul is sufficient to produce 
the action of the active intellect, will be clear to any one who 
considers the necessity for positing such an intellect. Our soul is 
found to be in potentiality to intelligible objects as sense to 
sensible objects: for as we are not always having sensations, so we are 
not always understanding.<A HREF="gc2_77d.htm>*</a> These intelligible 
objects Plato assumed to exist by themselves, calling them 'Ideas': 
hence it was not necessary for him to posit any 'active intellect' 
rendering objects intelligible.<A HREF="gc2_77e.htm>*</a> But if this 
Platonic position were true, the absolutely better objects of 
intelligence should be better also relatively to us, and be better 
understood by us, which is manifestly not the case: for things are more 
intelligible to us which are nigher to sense, though in themselves they 
are less excellent objects of understanding. Hence Aristotle was moved 
to lay down the doctrine, that the things which are intelligible to us 
are not any self-existent objects of understanding, but are gathered 
from objects of sense. Hence he had to posit some faculty to do this 
work of making terms of understanding: that faculty is the active 
intellect. The active intellect therefore is posited to make terms of 
understanding proportionate to our capacity. Such work does not 
transcend the measure of intellectual light connatural to us. Hence 
there is no difficulty in attributing the action of the active 
intellect to the native light of our soul, especially as Aristotle 
compares the active intellect to light (<i>De anima</i>, III, v, 2).
