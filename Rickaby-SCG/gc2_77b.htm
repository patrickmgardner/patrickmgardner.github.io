'That which is actually found in the phantasms' is 'definite likenesses 
of the natures of sensible things.' The objection may be raised, than 
when these likenesses are 'dematerialised,' all likeness to sensible 
material things is lost. The answer, I take it, is that 
'dematerialising' means only 'universalising'. I have a universal idea 
of a rainbow without blinding my mind's eye to its colours.
