A venial sin must always be some particular act.
Now it is not easy to specify and put one's finger on
the particular act, whereby a man, once poor, but
now making money fast and eagerly, "exceeds his
proper measure," as St Thomas puts it. Like every
thing else in the Middle Ages, differences of class,
marked by differences of dress, were more fixed and
immutable than with us. Sumptuary laws restrained the
low-born from donning the habiliments proper to the
nobility. Sumptuary laws are not yet quite dead. A
University would take it in ill part for a Commoner
to go about in a Master's gown. A civilian would not
be received in society, who persisted in wearing the
uniform of a field-marshal. St Thomas would apparently 
take such uppishness and assumption for a
venial sin.
