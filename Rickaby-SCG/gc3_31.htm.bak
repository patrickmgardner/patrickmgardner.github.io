<H1>That Happiness does not consist in Worldly Power</h1>

MAN is called good inasmuch as he attains to the sovereign good. But 
inasmuch as he has power he is not called either good or evil: for he 
is not good who can do good things, nor is a man evil of being able to 
do evil things. Therefore the highest good does not consist in being 
powerful.<A HREF="gc3_31a.htm">*</a><p> 

3. All power is over another (<i>ad alterum</i>). But the highest good 
is not over another.
