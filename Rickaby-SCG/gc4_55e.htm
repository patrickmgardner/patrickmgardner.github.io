What St Thomas here calls 'satisfaction,' answers fairly well to 
the French <i>amende honorable</i>. As St Thomas here teaches, it is not 
correct, in the strictest theological parlance, to say that Christ was 
'punished' for the sins of the world. Great authorities may speak 
popularly and loosely on this as on other topics. But in strict 
theology we say that Christ made the <i>amende honorable</i> for the sins of 
all His brethren, and that in the manner most humiliating, painful, 
and costly to Himself. When any sinner, identifying himself with this 
<i>amende honorable</i> and satisfaction of his Saviour, cries with Him: 
'Father, forgive me, for I knew not what I did'; that is to 
say: 'I was a fool in doing as I did, and now I see
my folly and repent of it': the satisfaction that
Christ made becomes available for that man, and
according to the nature of his sorrow he is either
forgiven or on the road to forgiveness.
