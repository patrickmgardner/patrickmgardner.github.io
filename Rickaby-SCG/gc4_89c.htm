According to the schoolmen, the reason why
any substance is changeable is because its matter is
not fully actuated by its substantial form, and thus
remains in potentiality to other forms. The heavenly
spheres (<i>corpora coelestia</i>) they thought were fully
actuated by their forms, and were therefore 
imperishable. They applied this doctrine to the body
after the resurrection, saying that then the body,
whether of a good or of a wicked man, was fully
actuated by the soul, and therefore was incorruptible.
This doctrine however had its difficulties, as we see
here, in respect of the lost being subject to sensible
pain, and even the just being susceptible of pleasurable 
impressions of sense. Cf. II, Chap. XCVIII (a
passage not translated): "The matter of a heavenly
sphere is so thoroughly perfected by its own form as
not to lie potentially open to other forms." Just so
is every risen human body, good or bad.
