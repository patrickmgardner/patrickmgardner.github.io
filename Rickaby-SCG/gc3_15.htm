<H1>That there is not any Sovereign Evil, acting as the Principle of All 
Evils</h1>

A sovereign evil should be without participation in any good, as that is 
the sovereign good which is wholly removed from evil.  But there cannot 
be any evil wholly removed from good, since evil is founded on good 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc3_11.htm">XI</a>).<p>

2. If anything is sovereignly evil, it must be evil by its very 
essence, as that is sovereignly good which is good by its essence.  But 
evil has no essence (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_7.htm">VII</a>).<p>

3. That which is a first principle is not caused by anything.  But all 
evil is caused by good (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_10.htm">X</a>).  There is 
therefore no evil first principle.<p>

5. The incidental must be posterior to the ordinary.  But evil happens 
only incidentally and beside the intention (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_4.htm">IV</a>).  
Therefore it is impossible for evil to be a first principle.<p>

Hereby is excluded the error of the Manicheans.
