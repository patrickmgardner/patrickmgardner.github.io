<H1>That the Souls of Dumb Animals are not Immortal</h1>

No activity of the sentient part can have place without a body. But in 
the souls of dumb animals we find no activity higher than the 
activities of the sentient part. That animals neither understand nor 
reason is apparent from this, that all animals of the same species 
behave alike, as being moved by nature, and not acting on any principle
of art: for every swallow makes its nest alike, and every spider its 
web alike. Therefore there is no activity in the soul of dumb animals 
that can possibly go on without a body.<A HREF="gc2_82a.htm>*</a><p>

2. Every form separated from matter is actually understood. Thus the 
active intellect makes impressions actually understood, inasmuch as it 
abstracts them. But if the soul of a dumb animal remains after the 
body is gone, it will be a form separated from matter. Therefore it 
will be form actually understood. But "in things separated from 
matter understanding and understood are the same" (<i>De Anima</i>, III, 
iv, 13). Therefore the soul of a dumb animal will have understanding, 
which is impossible.<A HREF="gc2_82b.htm>*</a><p> 

In everything that is apt to arrive at any perfection, there is found a 
natural craving after that perfection: for good is what all crave 
after, everything its own good. But in dumb animals there is no 
craving after perpetuity of being except in the form of perpetuity of 
the species, inasmuch as they have an instinct of generation, whereby 
the species is perpetuated, -- and the same is found in plants.<A 
HREF="gc2_82c.htm>*</a> But they have not that craving consequent upon 
apprehension: for since the sentient soul apprehends only what is here 
and now, it cannot possibly apprehend perpetuity of being, and 
therefore has no physical craving after such perpetuity.<A 
HREF="gc2_82d.htm>*</a> Therefore the soul of a dumb animal is 
incapable of perpetuity of being.<p>
