What follows is the second part of Chap. XCVI. I have appended it to 
Chap. XCV, to which in subject-matter it belongs, and without which it 
is in complete as leaving the most serious difficulty unresolved. 
Indeed, seeing how the Bergamo autograph in the Vatican consists of 
loose parchments tied together, I suspect that the order of them has 
got deranged, and that what follows was meant by the Saint to belong to 
Chap. XCV.
