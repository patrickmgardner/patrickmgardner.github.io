The brightness of light is nothing else than its
intensity; or as we might say, its adequacy. Thus the
Son is adequate, or equal, to the Father. But in these
metaphors the imagination, and consequently the
meaning, of the ancients who first used them, and our
imagination, disciplined by modern science, continually 
fail to correspond. To understand the ancients,
we must leave our science behind, and dwell in the
<i>prima facie</i> region of sense and first impressions.
