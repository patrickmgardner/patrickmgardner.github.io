The links of St Thomas's argument are these:<p>

(a) The Word was made flesh the very instant
that His Humanity was conceived, the very instant
that Mary spoke the word: <i>Be it done to me according
to thy word</i>.<p>

(b) The Word would not take flesh otherwise
than by assuming a body there and then animated
with a rational soul.<p>

(c) A rational soul cannot inform a body not yet
developed to human shape. In the ordinary course
of human embryonic development, the embryo at
conception, being incapable even of a sentient, still
more of a rational soul, is animated with a vegetative
soul, which after some days gives place to a sentient
soul, and that after more days are expired, and the
foetus is come to human shape, is finally replaced by
a rational soul: all which process is drawn out at
length in B. II, Chapp. <A HREF="gc2_88.htm">LXXXVIII</a>, 
LXXXIX.<p>

(d) This ordinary process of nature had to be set
aside in the formation of Mary's miraculous Child.
His Body was complete from the first, a fit receptacle
for a rational soul. His Body consequently did not
develop, it simply grew.<p>

Now the link (c) of this chain is broken by
modern Catholic theologians. They see no difficulty
in a rational soul informing a body not yet developed
to human shape. They hold that the rational soul is
always infused in the very instant of conception.
Thereupon they conclude that the way of formation
of Christ's body, after conception, in no way differed
from that of other human bodies, <i>nihil differens fuisse
a reliquis foetibus humanis</i> (Pesch, <i>Praelectiones 
Dogmaticae</i>, vol. IV, p. 85, ed. 1896).<p>

Scripture is silent on the subject; modern biology
would be amazed at such a mode of growth as St
Thomas and Suarez after him suppose; and miracles,
as Suarez himself here owns, are not to be multiplied
without necessity or high congruity (Suarez, <i>De 
mysteriis Christi</i>, disp. II, sect. 2, nn. 2, 4).<p>

This discussion has an extrinsic interest as 
illustrating two several views of another mighty 
development, that of Church government and doctrine.
The development of the Bridegroom may well be
the pattern of that of the Bride.<p>

Accepting St Thomas's supposition of the three
successive souls, as a supposition not yet quite 
exploded, there is still some doubt as to his conclusion,
in point of link (b). The Word remained united with
the dead Body of Christ, from whence all soul was
departed: might it not then unite itself with a living
Body into which in due course of nature a rational
soul was soon to come?
