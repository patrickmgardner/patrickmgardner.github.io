This is precisely what Nominalism denies, or ignores. Nominalism 
eradicates the conception of 'nature' (<b>phusis</b>), and reduces 
everything to 'convention' (<b>nomos</b>). This chapter, an admirable 
one, containing the very pith and marrow of moral philosophy, is 
written against the Nominalists. It tells against Hobbes. For its 
importance see notes, [<A HREF="gc3_97b.htm">3.97b</a>], [<A 
HREF="gc3_123c.htm">3.123c</a>], with the text corresponding [<A 
HREF="gc3_97.htm">3.97</a> and <A HREF="gc3_123.htm">3.123</a>].
