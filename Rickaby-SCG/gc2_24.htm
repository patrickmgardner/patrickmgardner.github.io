<H1>That God acts by His Wisdom<A HREF="gc2_24a.htm">*</a></h1> 

The will is moved by some apprehension.<A HREF="gc1_24b.htm">*</a> But 
God acts by willing. Since then in God there is intellectual 
apprehension only, and He understands nothing otherwise than by 
understanding Himself, whom to understand is to be wise (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_54.htm">LIV</a>), it follows that God works out all things 
according to His wisdom.<p> 

2. Every agent acts in so far as it has within it something 
corresponding to the effect to be produced. But in every voluntary 
agent, as such, what corresponds to the effect to be produced is some 
intellectual presentation of the same. Were there no more than a mere 
physical disposition to produce the effect, the agent could act only to 
one effect, because for one physical cause there is only one physical 
mode of operation (<i>ratio naturalis unius est una tantum</i>). Every 
voluntary agent therefore produces its effect according to the mode of 
intellectual operation proper to itself. But God acts by willing, and 
therefore it is by the wisdom of His intellect that he brings things 
into being.<p> 

3. The function of wisdom is to set things in order. Now the setting of 
things in order can be effected only through a knowledge of the 
relation and proportion of the said things to one another, and to some 
higher thing which is the end and purpose of them all: for the mutual 
order of things to one another is founded upon their order to the end 
which they are to serve. But it is proper to intelligence alone to know 
the mutual relations and proportions of things. Again, it is proper to 
wisdom to judge of things as they stand to their highest cause.<A 
HREF="gc2_24c.htm">*</a> Thus every setting of things in order by 
wisdom must be the work of some intelligence.<A 
HREF="gc2_24d.htm">*</a> But the things produced by God bear an orderly 
relation to one another, which cannot be attributed to chance, since it 
(<i>sit</i> not <i>sint</i>) obtains always or for the most part. Thus 
it is evident that God, in bringing things into being, intended them in 
a certain order. Therefore His production of them was a work of wisdom. 
<p> 

All this is confirmed by divine authority, for it is said: <i>Thou has 
made all things in wisdom</i> (Ps. ciii, 24); and <i>the Lord in wisdom 
founded the earth</i> (Prov. iii, 19).<p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of some who said that all things depend on 
the absolute will of God, independent of any reason.<p>
