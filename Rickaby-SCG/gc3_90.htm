<H1>That Human Choices and Volitions are subject to Divine 
Providence</h1>

THE government of providence proceeds from the divine love where with 
God loves His creatures. Love consists chiefly in the lover wishing 
good to the loved one. The more God loves things, then, the more they 
fall under His providence. This Holy Writ teaches, saying: <i>God 
guards all that love him</i> (Ps. cxliv, 20); and the Philosopher also 
teaches that God has especial care of those who love understanding, and 
considers them His friends.<A HREF="gc3_90a.htm">*</a> Hence He loves 
especially subsistent intelligences, and their volitions and choices 
fall under His providence.<p> 

6. The inward good endowments of man, which depend on his will and 
choice, are more proper to man than external endowments, as the gaining 
of riches: hence it is according to the former that man is said to be 
good, not according to the latter. If then human choices and motions 
of the will do not fall under divine providence, but only external 
advantages, it will be more true to say that human affairs are beyond 
providence than that they are under providence.
