<H1>That the Will of God is not of things in themselves Impossible</h1>

THOSE things are in themselves impossible, which involve an 
inconsistency, as that man should be an ass, which involves the 
rational being irrational. But what is inconsistent with a thing, 
excludes some one of the conditions requisite to it, as being an ass 
excludes a man's reason.  If therefore God necessarily wills the things 
requisite to that which by supposition He does will, it is impossible 
for Him to will what is inconsistent therewith.<p> 

2. God, in willing His own being, wills all other things, that He does 
will, in so far as they have some likeness to it.  But in so far as 
anything is inconsistent with the notion of being as such, there cannot 
stand therein any likeness to the first or divine being, which is the 
fountain of being.  God therefore cannot will anything that is 
inconsistent with the notion of being as such, as that anything should 
be at once being and not being, that affirmation and negation should be 
true together, or any other such essential impossibility, 
inconsistency, and implied contradiction.<p> 

3. What is no object of the intellect, can be no object of the will.  
But essential impossibilities, involving notions mutually inconsistent, 
are no objects of intellect, except perchance through the error of a 
mind that does not understand the proprieties of things, which cannot 
be said of God.
