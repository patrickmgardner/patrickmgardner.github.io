<H1>That the Divine Law directs man to a Rational Use of Corporeal and 
Sensible Things</h1> 

AS man's mind may be raised to God by corporeal and sensible things, 
provided that they are duly used to show reverence to God, so also the 
undue use of them either totally withdraws the mind from God, fixing 
the final intention of the will upon inferior things,<A 
HREF="gc3_121a.htm">*</a> or clogs the mind's aspiration after God, 
making it take unnecessary interest in such things.<A 
HREF="gc3_121b.htm">*</a>  Now the divine law is given for this end 
chiefly, to lead man to cling to God. It is a function therefore of 
divine law to direct man in his affection for and use of corporeal and 
sensible things.<p> 

2. As man's mind is subordinate to God, so his body is subordinate to 
his soul, and his lower powers to his reason. It belongs therefore to 
divine providence, the plan of which, as proposed by God to man, is the 
divine law, to see that all things keep their order. Therefore that 
divine law must so direct man as that his lower powers shall be subject 
to his reason, and his body to his soul, and exterior things shall 
serve his necessity.<p> 

4. Every lawgiver must comprise in his legislation those enactments 
without which the law could not be observed. Now law being set over 
reason,<A HREF="gc3_121c.htm">*</a> man could not follow the law unless 
all other things belonging to man were subjected to reason.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Your reasonable service</i> (Rom. xii, i); and, 
<i>This is the will of God, your sanctification</i> (i Thess. iv, 
9).<p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of such as say that those acts alone are 
sinful, whereby our neighbour is either hurt or shocked.
