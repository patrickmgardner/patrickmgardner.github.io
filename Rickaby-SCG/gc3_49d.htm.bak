In later life, St Thomas wrote more cautiously on this subject. What he 
means is this. I call God, let us say, 'intelligent.' And so He is 
intelligent. He is, if I may use a vulgar expression, 'getting on that 
way' which I call the way of intelligence; only, He goes so on in it, 
that the poor little beginning of intelligence, which is all that I can 
master and appreciate as such, is wholly unfit to stand for His 
infinite intelligence. -- To put the same in a more learned way. God to 
me is not bounded in <i>this</i>, which I understand, but he is 
<i>this-like, and still more this-like to infinity</i>. To express the 
fact, I may call God, and truly call Him, <i>this</i> (e.g., 
'intelligent'); but I may as truly (though not always as safely to 
unintelligent ears) deny the same of Him, merely meaning by the denial 
that the <i>this</i>, though the best and truest word we have, is a 
wholly inadequate expression to contain and represent Him, who "is not 
mere Being, but even beyond Being in dignity and power" (Plato, 
<i>Rep</i>. 5O9 b). Here we have what St Thomas (B. I, Ch. <A 
HREF="gc1_14.htm">XIV</a>) calls <i>via remotionis</i>.
