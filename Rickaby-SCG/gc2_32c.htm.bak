St Thomas could scarcely accept the whole account, given by the 
opponent, of an 'incomplete volition,' notably the statement that a 
volition is incomplete, "when there is expected the arrival of some 
opportune time that is not yet come": otherwise, antecedently to 
creation, God's volition of creating would be incomplete. St Thomas's 
use of 'at that time' (<i>tunc</i>), speaking of creation, has this 
difficulty, that time began only with creation. There is nothing to 
mark creation starting at one point of time rather than at another, 
looking at the eternal <i>now</i> of God. We can only measure the date 
of creation backwards, and say that infinite time has not elapsed since 
creation; and that doubtless is what St Thomas meant, as his next 
answer shows.
