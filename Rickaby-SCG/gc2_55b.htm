The meaning of this impossibility has been explained in Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_30.htm">XXX</a>, and appears again in the last argument of 
this chapter. For the doctrine that "subsistent intelligences [angels] 
are pure subsistent forms" see B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_44.htm">XLIV</a>, n. 7, with note. The Platonic 'idea,' 
existing apart from things, was personified by the Neoplatonists, and 
became a <b>daimon</b> (spirit). But in becoming a spirit it still 
remained a self-subsistent 'idea,' or 'form,' to the Neoplatonist. The 
schoolmen held the doctrine of angels as part of the Christian 
revelation. But being much influenced by Neoplatonism through Arabian 
and other channels, they came to say of angels some things that the 
Neoplatonists had said of <b>daimones</b>. The angel then <i>ipsa 
forma subsistens</i>, it was <i>substantia separata</i>, it was a pure 
substantial form subsisting by itself. It stood in sharp contrast with 
Aristotelian 'forms' that were in matter, the most noteworthy of which 
was the human soul, the 'form of the body.'
