<H1>That the acts of the Rational Creature are guided by God, not 
merely to the realisation of the Specific Type, but also to the 
realisation of the Individual</h1>

EVERYTHING is reckoned to exist for the sake of its activity, activity 
being the final perfection of a thing. Thus then everything, so far as 
it comes under divine providence, is guided by God to its proper act. 
But a rational creature subject to providence is governed and provided 
for as an individual for its own sake, not merely for the sake of the 
species, as is the case with other perishable creatures (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_112.htm">CXII</a>). Thus then rational creatures alone are 
guided by God to their acts, not merely specific but individual.<p> 

2. Whatever things are guided in their acts only in what appertains to 
the species, such things have not the choice of doing or not doing: for 
what is consequent upon the species is common and natural to all 
individuals contained under the species; and what is natural is not in 
our power.<A HREF="gc3_113a.htm">*</a> If then man were guided in his 
acts only to the extent of fitting him for his species, he would have no 
choice of doing or not doing, but would have to follow the natural 
inclination common to the whole species, as happens in all irrational 
creatures.<A HREF="gc3_113b.htm">*</a><p>

3. In whatsoever beings there are found actions over and above such as 
fall in with the common inclination of the species, such beings must be 
regulated by divine providence in their actions with some guidance 
beyond that which is extended to the species. But in the rational 
creature many actions appear, which the inclination of the species is 
not sufficient to account for, as is shown by their being not alike in 
all, but various in various individuals.<p> 

4. The rational creature alone is capable of being guided to its acts 
not merely specifically but individually: for by the gift of 
understanding and reason it is able to discern the diversity of good and 
evil according as is befitting to diverse individuals, times and 
places.<A HREF="gc3_113c.htm">*</a><p> 

5. The rational creature is not only governed by divine providence, but 
is also capable to some extent of grasping the notion of providence, 
whereas other creatures share in providence merely by being subject to 
providence. Thus the rational creature is partaker in providence, not 
merely by being governed, but by governing: for it governs itself by 
its own acts, and also other beings. But every lower providence is 
subject to the supreme providence of God. Therefore the government of 
the acts of the rational creature, in so far as they are personal acts, 
belongs to divine providence.<p>

6. The personal acts of the rational creature are properly the acts 
that come from a rational soul. Now the rational soul is capable of 
perpetuity, not only in the species, as other creatures are, but also 
in the individual. The acts therefore of the rational creature are 
guided by divine providence, not only as they belong to the species, 
but also as they are personal acts.<A HREF="gc3_113d.htm">*</a>
