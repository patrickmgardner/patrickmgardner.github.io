<i>Concretionem habens</i>.  The <i>concrete</i> to St Thomas
means the <i>composite</i>. Any existing created substance,
as he teaches, is compounded of specific nature and
individualising notes, of actuality and potentiality, of
essence and existence.  Thus, in creation, the <i>abstract</i>
alone is simple, <i>concrete</i> being is compound.
