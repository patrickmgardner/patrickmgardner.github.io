In <i>Ethics and Natural Law</i>, p. 91, it is shown
why the whole business of temperance is to restrain.
There is however an Epicurean temperance, which,
taking pleasure to be happiness and the last end of man,
at the same time recognises it to be attainable only
under limitations, and so economises what it takes to
to be the good wine of life, that it may not run out
too fast. Temperance is quite intelligible even in the
enjoyment of the last end, on the assumption that the
last end is attainable only in small amounts, and may
be exhausted by greediness. This view allows that
the last end is in itself and in the abstract desirable
<b>eis apeiron</b>, but only in the abstract; there being limits
to its practical attainability. It is a point not to be taken
for granted, that happiness, adequate to desire, is attainable 
at all. The attainability of perfect happiness
is a theorem requiring proof; and proof of it is impossible, 
if the life of the world to come is not to enter
into the discussion. See Chap. XLVIII: also <i>Ethics
and Natural Law</i>, pp. 13-20. Waiving that discussion,
however, the previous arguments, nn. 1, 3, 4, 5, avail
to show that bodily pleasures are not the chief ingredient
of the limited happiness possible to man on earth.
