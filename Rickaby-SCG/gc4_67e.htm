Read 1 Cor. xiii, 8-12, and thereupon the following from some 
unpublished <i>Dialogues of the Dead</i>.<p> 

<i>Spirit of Aristotle</i>: "Thomas, your explanations are harder to 
accept than the doctrine which you undertook to explain."<p> 

<i>Spirit of Aquinas</i>: "My dear sir, take all this explanation as 
child's play on my part: for, as Paul says, when I was a child, I spoke 
as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but now I am 
become a man, and see face to face, I have put away the things of a 
child."<p> 

Surely we may call <i>the things of a child</i> all mere human 
speculations on a mystery so incomprehensible as the Holy Eucharist. I 
have nothing to say against the wisdom of the school, but it does not 
make transubstantiation one whit clearer to me. I remain in Cardinal 
Newman's frame of mind, when he wrote:<p> 

"I cannot tell how it is, but I say: Why should it not be? What's to 
hinder it? What do I know of substance or matter? Just as much as the 
greatest philosophers, and that is nothing at all . . . . The Catholic 
doctrine leaves phenomena alone. It does not say that the phenomena go: 
on the contrary, it says that they remain: nor does it say that the 
same phenomena are in several places at once. It deals with what no 
one on earth knows anything about, the material substances themselves" 
(<i>Apologia</i>, p. 239, ed. 1895).<p> 

The Cardinal in this passage writes in the easy epistolary style which 
he often affects, not in the solemn and strict phraseology of a legal 
document, civil or ecclesiastical. Newman knew, as well as any man, 
that substance is the reality that underlies appearances, the objective 
unity of those appearances, the noumenon, or thing in itself. We know 
that, and we say that; and, thanks to that modicum of knowledge, 
transubstantiation is not to us a <i>vox nihili</i>: but how much more 
do we know? and how far does that slight concept of substance carry 
towards a comprehensive understanding of transubstantiation ?
