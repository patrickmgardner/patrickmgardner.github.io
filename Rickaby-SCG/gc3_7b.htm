St Thomas here speaks, as philosophers always
speak, in the universal, not of this individual and
that.  No natural kind or class, as such, either is evil
or is the subject of evil qualities, i.e., of privations of
what is due to nature.  The kind, as such, has all
things that it is proper for its members to have,
though sundry members of the kind are wanting in
some of these things.  There are one-eyed men, but
mankind has two eyes: there are invalids, but the
race is healthy.
