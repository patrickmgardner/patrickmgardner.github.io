<H1>Of the Effects which the Scriptures attribute to the Holy Ghost in 
respect of the whole Creation</h1>

THE love wherewith God loves His own goodness is the cause of the 
creation of things (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_86.htm">LXXXVI</a>); and 
it is laid down that the Holy Ghost proceeds as the love wherewith God 
loves Himself. Therefore the Holy Ghost is the principle of the 
creation of things; and this is signified in Ps. ciii, 30: <i>Send 
forth thy spirit and they shall be created</i>. Again, as the Holy 
Ghost proceeds as love, and love is an impulsive and motor power, the 
motion that is from God in things is appropriately attributed to the 
Holy Ghost. But the first motion, or change, coming from God in things 
is the production of the diversity of species from matter created 
formless (<i>ex materia creata informi species diversas produxit</i>). 
This work the Scripture attributes to the Holy Ghost: <i> The Spirit of 
God moved over the waters</i> (Gen. i, 2)<A HREF="gc4_20a.htm">*</a> By 
the <i>the waters</i> Augustine wishes to be understood primordial 
matter. The Spirit of the Lord is said to move over them, not as being 
in motion on Himself, but as the principle of motion. The government of 
creation also is fitly assigned to the Holy Ghost, as government is the 
moving and directing of things to their proper ends. And because the 
governing of subjects is an act proper to a lord, lordship too is aptly 
attributed to the Holy Ghost: the Spirit is Lord (1 Cor. iii, 17).<A

Life also particularly appears in movement. As then impulse and 
movement by reason of love are proper to the Holy Spirit, so too is 
life fitly attributed to Him, as it is said: <i>It is the Spirit that 
quickeneth</i> (John vi, 64: 2 Cor. iii, 6).
