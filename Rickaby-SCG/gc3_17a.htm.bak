<i>Propter quod est unumquodque, et illud magis</i>, a favourite saying 
of the schoolmen, answering to some such Aristotelian Greek as <b>di 
ou hekaston, kakeino mallon</b>.  To defend the saying, we must have at 
hand distinctions between 'cause' (<i>causa per se</i>) and 'occasion' 
(<i>causa per accidens</i>); also between having an attribute 
'virtually and in a better way' (<i>eminenter</i>) and having it 
'precisely in this form' (<i>formaliter</i>).
