<H1>How God is seen as He essentially is</h1>

AS shown above (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_49.htm">XLIX</a>), the divine 
substance cannot be seen by the intellect in any created presentation. 
Hence, if God's essence is to be seen, the intelligence must see it in 
the divine essence itself, so that in such vision the divine essence 
shall be at once the object which is seen and that whereby it is 
seen.<A HREF="gc3_51a.htm">*</a><p> 

This is the immediate vision of God that is promised us in Scripture: 
<i>We see now in a glass darkly, but then face to face</i> (i Cor. 
xiii, 2): a text absurd to take in a corporeal sense, as though we 
could imagine a bodily face in Deity itself, whereas it has been shown 
that God is incorporeal (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_20.htm">XX</a>). Nor again is it possible for 
us with our bodily face to see God, since the bodily sense of sight, 
implanted in our face, can be only of bodily things. Thus then shalt we 
see God face to face, in that we shall have an immediate vision of Him, 
as of a man whom we see face to face. By this vision we are singularly 
assimilated to God, and are partakers in His happiness: for this is His 
happiness, that He essentially understands His own substance. Hence it 
is said: <i>When He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall 
see Him as He is</i> (i John iii, 2). And the Lord said: <i>I prepare 
for you as my Father hath prepared for me a kingdom, that ye may eat 
and drink at my table in my kingdom</i> (Luke xxii, 29). This cannot be 
understood of bodily meat and drink, but of that food which is taken at 
the table of Wisdom, whereof it is said by Wisdom: <i>Eat ye my bread 
and drink the wine that I have mingled for you</i> (Prov. ix, 5). They 
therefore eat and drink at the table of God, who enjoy the same 
happiness wherewith God is happy, seeing Him in the way which He sees 
Himself.
