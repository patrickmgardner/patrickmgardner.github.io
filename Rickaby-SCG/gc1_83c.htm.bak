And, possibly, the human shape, if He wishes the being 
of a rational animal. Or is a rational animal possible 
in the shape of a pig? Who shall reckon or 
particularise the essential connexions and repugnances 
of things? How much, that we might wish to cast out, 
cleaves to nature and must be, if natural things are 
to be at all! How thoughtlessly may we murmur at God 
for not severing two elements essentially 
inseparable, or not conjoining two others mutually 
repugnant! Is it possible under any circumstances,
or under what circumstances, for man's final happiness
to be secured without toil and trial, a crown without
a cross?<p>

This is not a difficult chapter, but it suggests a 
great difficulty: how God, willing from eternity this 
present creation, is perfectly the same God as He might 
have been from eternity willing no such thing; of how, 
there being not the slightest <i>entitative</i> difference 
between God willing to create and God having no such 
will, creation, which was nothing to begin with, ever 
came to be rather than not to be. The difficulty has 
its foundation in this, that, within our experience, 
every new effect involves some antecedent change either 
in the agent or in the matter acted upon. The more 
powerful the agent, the less change is required, as 
when a strong man with little or no effort lifts a 
weight, which a weaker one would have to strain himself 
to raise from the ground.  Hence we may faintly surmise 
how 'in the limit' an Almighty agent would act without 
being in the least altered by his action from the 
being that he would have been, had he remained at 
rest.  Not that I take this suggestion to remove the 
whole difficulty.<p>
