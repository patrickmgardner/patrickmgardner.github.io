The argument supposes the continuity of matter, that is to say, that 
the ultimate elements of matter are extended solids without interstices 
of vacuum. The dynamist theory on the other hand supposes that points, 
centres of attractive or repulsive force, are indissolubly bound up in 
primitive molecules, which molecules are extended, but not solidly 
continuous, there being vacuum between point and point of the 
multitudinous points which make up the molecule. In this theory, action 
takes place from each point, or centre of force, upon all points within 
the sphere of activity, accordingly to the law of the inverse square of 
the distance from the point, or centre of activity, attractive or 
repulsive. Thus every point is in immediate <i>virtual</i> contact with 
endless other points, but not in physical contact with any. Dynamism 
may be tenable or untenable: either way it is well worth the 
psychologist's while to consider what physical theory any argument of 
his presupposes, and what it excludes; and conversely, what physical 
theory, if established, would necessitate a modification of his 
argoment.
