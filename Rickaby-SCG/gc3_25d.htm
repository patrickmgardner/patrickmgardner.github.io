There is a Scholastic maxim, <i>contra negantem principia fustibus est 
argumentandum</i>;but that can scarcely have been the 'direction' which 
St Thomas had in mind.  <i>Philosophia prima</i> here means metaphysics 
and psychology, culminating in natural theology.  There is no better 
specimen of it than these first three books <i>Contra Gentiles</i>.  
Accordingly it is defined in book I, chap. <A HREF="gc1_1.htm">I</a> as 
wisdom.
