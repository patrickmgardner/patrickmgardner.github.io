The risen Saint is an animal, as consisting of
body and soul: but he no longer functions as an 
animal in the processes of organic life: in him those
processes have ceased: they are rendered unnecessary
by the direct control which the spirit now wields
over the flesh. His body is not spirit, but spiritualised. 
So the human nature of our Lord is not God,
but divinised, <b>tetheopoi&ecirc;menon</b> 
as the Fathers say.
