<H1>Arguments against the Truth of the Conclusion last drawn,
with Solutions of the Same</h1>

<center>Chapter VI</center><p>For the clearer solution of the arguments 
alleged we must observe that evil may be considered either in a 
substance or in some action of a substance.  Evil in a substance 
consists in its lack of something which it is naturally apt to have and 
ought to have.  It is no evil to a man not to have wings, because he is 
not by nature apt to have them; nor not to have yellow hair, because, 
though his nature is apt to have such hair, still that colour of hair 
is not due to his nature.  But it is an evil to him not to have hands, 
because he is apt by nature to have them, and ought to have them, if he 
is to be perfect; and yet the same is no evil to a bird.  Every 
privation, properly and strictly speaking, is of something which one is 
naturally apt to have and ought to have.  The essence of evil consists 
in privation, thus understood.  Primordial matter, being in 
potentiality to all forms, is naturally in actuality without any one 
particular form that you like to mention.<A HREF="gc3_5a.htm">*</a>  
But some particular form is due to each of the things that are 
constituted out of such matter.  The privation therefore of such a 
form, in regard of primordial matter, is no evil to the nature of 
primordial matter; but in regard of the compound whereof it is the 
form, it is an evil to that compound thing: thus it is evil to 
incandescent gas (<i>ignis</i>) to be deprived of the form of 
incandescent gas.  And since privations are not said to 'be' except so 
far as they are in a subject, a privation will be 'simply evil,' when 
it is evil in regard of the subject in which it is: otherwise, it will 
be 'evil relatively to something' (<i>malum alicujus</i>), but not 
'simply evil.'<p> 

<i>Arg. 1</i> (Chap. V).  What happens beside the intention of the 
agent is said to be 'matter of luck and chance and rare occurrence.'<A 
HREF="gc3_5b.htm">*</a>  But evil is not said to be matter of luck and 
chance, or rare occurrence, but to happen continually, or for the most 
part: thus in the physical order the unmaking of one thing is always 
attached to the making of another; and in the moral order sin is of 
usual occurrence.<A HREF="gc3_5c.htm">*</a>  This does not look like 
evil arising contrary to intention.<p> 

<i>Reply</i> (Chap. VI).  Not everything that is beside the intention of 
the doer need be the result of luck or chance.  For if what is beside 
the intention follows upon what is intended either always or 
frequently, it cannot be said to happen by luck or chance.  Thus in him 
who intends to enjoy the pleasantness of wine, if from his drinking 
wind drunkenness follows always or frequently, it will be no matter of 
bad luck or chance: but it would be by chance, if it were quite the 
exception.  Although then the evil of one thing perishing in course of 
nature follows beside the intention of him who brings the other thing 
into being, such evil nevertheless follows invariably: for invariably 
to the positing of one form there is annexed the privation of 
another:<A HREF="gc3_5d.htm">*</a> hence this perishing does not happen 
by chance, nor as the exception, though the privation is sometimes not 
evil simply, but only a relative evil, as has been said.  But if it be 
such a privation as to deprive the new being produced of what is due to 
it, it will be matter of chance and simply evil, as is the case of 
monstrous births: for such a mishap does not follow of necessity upon 
what is intended, but is contrary to it, since the agent intends the 
perfection of the being that he engenders. -- Evil affecting action 
happens in physical agents for want of active power: hence, if the 
agent's power is defective, this evil happens contrary to intention, 
yet not by chance, because it necessarily follows upon such an agent, 
when such agent suffers this failure of power either always or 
frequently: but it will be by chance, if the failure rarely accompanies 
such an agent. -- Coming to voluntary agents, intention in them must be 
of some particular good, if action is to follow: for universal 
considerations of themselves do not move the will, unless there be 
added the consideration of the particular circumstances under which the 
action is to take place.  If then the good that is intended has 
conjoined with it the privation of rational good either always or 
frequently, there follows moral evil, and that not by chance, as is 
clear in his case who wishes to cohabit with a woman for pleasure, 
while the inordination of adultery is annexed to that pleasure: in 
that case the evil of adultery does not ensue by chance: but it would 
be an evil happening by chance, if upon the thing intended there 
followed some exceptional misadventure, as when one aiming at a bird 
kills a man.  That goods of this sort, upon which privations of 
rational good follow, are so generally intended, arises from the 
practice of most men living according to sense, which they do because 
sensible things are more manifest to us,<A HREF="gc3_5e.htm">*</a> and 
make more effectual motives in the particular circumstances in which 
our action is cast; and many such goods are attended with privation of 
rational good.<p> 

<i>Arg. 2.</i>  Aristotle (<i>Eth. Nic.</i>, III, vii)expressly says 
that wickedness is voluntary, and proves it from the fact that men do 
unjust acts voluntarily: but, he adds, it is irrational to pretend that 
a man voluntarily acting unjustly does not wish to be unjust, or 
voluntarily committing rape does not wish to be incontinent; and that 
is why legislators punish wicked men as voluntary evil-doers.  It 
seems then that evil is not irrespective of will or intention.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i>  Though evil be beside the intention, it is still 
voluntary, not as it is in itself, but incidentally.  The object of 
<i>intention</i> is the final end, willed for its own sake: but the 
object of <i>volition</i> is also that which is willed for the sake of 
something else, though absolutely it would not be willed,<A 
HREF="gc3_5f.htm">*</a> -- as one throws cargo into the sea to save the 
ship, not <i>intending</i> the casting away of the cargo, but the 
safety of the vessel; and yet <i>willing</i> the casting away of the 
cargo, not simply and absolutely, but for the sake of safety.  In like 
manner, for the gaining of some sensible good, one <i>wills</i> to do 
an inordinate action, not <i>intending</i> the inordinateness, nor 
willing it simply, but for that purpose. And therefore in this way 
wickedness and sin are said to be voluntary, like the casting away of 
cargo at sea.<p> 

<i>Arg. 3.</i>  Every process of nature serves as an end intended by 
nature.  But destruction is as much a natural change as production: 
therefore its end, which is a privation and counts as evil, is intended 
by nature as much as form and goodness, which are the end of 
production.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i>  From what has been said it appears that what is simply 
evil is altogether contrary to intention in the works of nature, as are 
monstrous births: but what is not simply evil, but only evil in a 
particular relation, is not intended by nature in itself, but 
incidentally.
