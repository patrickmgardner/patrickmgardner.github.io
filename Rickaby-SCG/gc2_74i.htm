<PRE>
     Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
     The soul that rises with us, our life's star,
        Hath had elsewhere its setting
        And cometh from afar:
     But trailing clouds of glory do we come
     From God, who is our home.
</pre>
     (Wordsworth's Ode, <i>Intimations of Immortality<br>
             from Recollections of Early Childhood.</i>)
