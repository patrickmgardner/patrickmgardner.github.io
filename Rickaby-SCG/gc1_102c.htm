The interest of all this to us is that the heaven,
which is the term of the labours of a Christian man,
is a participation in the perfect and transcendent
happiness here shadowed forth. I will anticipate and
quote the conclusion of B. III, Chap. LI. -- "By
this vision we are made like to God, and become
partakers of His happiness. For God Himself by His
essence understands His substance, and that is His
happiness. Hence it is said: <i>When he appeareth, he
shall be like unto him, because he shall see him as he is</i>
(I John iii, 2).  And the Lord said: <i>I dispose unto you,
as my Father hath disposed unto me, a kingdom, that ye eat
and drink at my table in my kingdom</i> (Luke xxii, 29).  
This cannot be understood of corporal meat or
drink, but must be spoken of that food which is
taken at the table of Wisdom, whereof Wisdom 
herself says: <i>Eat my bread, and drink the wine that I have
mingled for you</i> (Prov. ix, 5).  They then eat and drink
at the table of God, who enjoy the same happiness
wherewith God is happy, seeing Him in the way in
which He sees Himself."
