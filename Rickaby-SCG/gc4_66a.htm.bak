The Real Presence is attached, not to the chemical 
elements of bread and wine, still less to any ultimate 
atoms, molecules, electrons, or the like, but to
the visible appearances of bread and wine. When
these appearances disappear, the Real Presence is
gone and the question is, what has happened to what
is left. St Thomas here, and <i>Sum. Theol.</i> 3, q. 77,
art. 5, seems to hold that what is left continues in
the miraculous state of accidents functioning as 
substance to the end of time. But may we not plead
against the saint his own words, that at that rate 
"by the frequent use of this mystery much of the 
corporeal nature originally created would have been
reduced," not exactly to "nothing," but to a state
bordering on nothingness? (Chap. 
<A HREF="gc4_43.htm">LXIII</a>.)<p>

This solution is not commonly taken. See Pesch,
S.J., <i>Praelectiones Dogmaticae</i>, vol. VI, 
pp. 311, 312.<p>

Also that wary theologian, Cardinal Franzelin,
writes: "When the accidents are so changed that
naturally they would no longer point to the substance
of bread and wine, but to some other, it becomes necessary 
for the Body and Blood of Christ no longer to
remain under them. Were they to remain, it would
be no longer the Sacrament instituted by Christ under
the appearances of bread and wine. When this substance 
of the Body and Blood of Christ ceases to be
under the changed accidents, those changed accidents
connaturally require some substance to answer to
them. As then upon the sufficient organisation of
the foetus the creation and infusion of the soul follows
according to a natural law laid down by God, so
when the accidents are specifically changed and the
Real Presence ceases, there follows the creation of a
corresponding substance under those new accidents, and 
that, we may say, connaturally, according to a
constant law laid down by God. This is equivalent
to the restitution of the matter that was before 
consecration (<i>De Eucharistia</i>, pp. 240 sq. 293).
