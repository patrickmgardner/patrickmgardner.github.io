<H1>That it was necessary for a Law to be given to Man by God</h1>

THE acts of irrational creatures, as they belong to the species, are 
guided by God according to a natural inclination, consequent upon the 
nature of the species. Therefore, over and above that, there must be 
given to men something to guide them in their personal acts, and that 
we call 'law.'<p> 

3 and 4. To them is a law fittingly given, who know what they are 
about, and have the alternative of doing a thing or leaving it undone. 
But that is proper to the rational creature only. Therefore the 
rational creature alone is conceptible of law.<A HREF="gc3_114a.htm">*</a>

Hence it is said: <i>I will give my law in their hearts</i> (Jer. xxx, 
33): <i>I will write for him my manifold laws</i> (Osee viii, 12).
