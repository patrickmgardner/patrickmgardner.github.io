<H1>Of Generation, Paternity, and Sonship in God</h1>

WE find in the New Testament frequent attestations that Jesus Christ
is the Son of God: Matt. xi, 27: Mark i, 1: John iii, 35: v, 21:
Rom. i, 1: Heb. i, 1. And the same, though more rarely, in the
Old Testament: Prov. xxx, 4: Ps. ii, 7: Ps. lxxxviii, 27. On the two last
passages we must understand that as some expressions in the context may
suit David, others not at all, these words are spoken of David and Solomon,
according to the custom of Scripture, as prefiguring some one else, in whom
all that is said is fulfilled.<p>

And because the names of 'Father' and 'Son' are consequent upon some
generative process, Scripture has not omitted to speak of divine generation,
Ps. ii, 7: Prov. viii, 24, 25: John i, 14, 18: Heb. i, 
6.<A HREF="gc4_2a.htm>*</a>
