<H1>That it is not necessary for Creatures to have existed from 
Eternity<A HREF="gc2_31a.htm">*</a></h1>

IF either the entire universe or any single creature necessarily 
exists, this  necessity must arise either from the being itself or from 
some other being.  From the being itself it cannot arise: for every 
being must be from the first being; and what has not being of itself, 
cannot necessarily exist of itself.<p> 

But if this supposed necessity arises from another being, that is, from 
some extrinsic cause, then, we observe, an extrinsic cause is either 
efficient or final. Now an effect necessarily arising from an efficient 
cause means that the agent acts of necessity: when the agent does not 
act of necessity, neither is it absolutely necessary for the effect to 
arise. But God does not act under any necessity in the production of 
creatures (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_23.htm">XXIII</a>). So far therefore as 
the efficient cause is concerned, there is not any absolute necessity 
for any creature to be. Neither is there any such necessity in 
connexion with the final cause. For means to an end receive necessity 
from their end only in so far as without them the end either cannot be 
at all, or cannot well be. Now the end proposed to the divine will in 
the production of things can be no other than God's own goodness, as 
has been shown (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_75.htm">LXXV</a>): which 
goodness depends on creatures neither for its being nor for its 
well-being (B. I, Chapp. <A HREF="gc1_13.htm">XIII</a>, <A 
HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>). There is then no absolute necessity 
for the being of any creature: nor is it necessary to suppose creation 
always to have existed.<A HREF="gc2_31b.htm">*</a><p>  

3. It is not necessary for God to will creation to be at all (B. I, 
Chap. LXXXI): therefore it is not necessary for God to will creation 
always to have been.<A HREF="gc2_31c.htm">*</a><p>
