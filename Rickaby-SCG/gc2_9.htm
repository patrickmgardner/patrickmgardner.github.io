<H1>That God's Power is His Action</h1> 

God's power is His substance, as has been shown in the previous 
chapter: also His action is His substance, as has been shown of His 
intellectual activity (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_45.htm">XLV</a>), and 
the same argument holds of His other activities. Therefore in God power 
and action are not two different things.<A HREF="gc2_9a.htm">*</a> <p> 

2. The action of any being is a complement of its power; for it stands 
to power as the second actuality to the first.<A HREF="gc2_9b.htm">*</a> 
But the divine power, being God's very essence, has no other complement 
than itself. And therefore in God action and power are not distinct.<p> 

Any action that is not the agent's very substance is in the agent as an 
accident in its subject. But in God there can be nothing accidental. 
Therefore in God His action is none other than His substance and His 
power. <p>
