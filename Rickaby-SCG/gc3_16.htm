<H1>That the End in View of everything is some Good</h1>

That to which a thing tends when in absence from it, and in which it 
rests when in possession of it, is the scope and aim and end in view.  
But everything, so long as it lacks the perfection proper to it, moves 
towards gaining that perfection, so far as it depends upon itself so 
to do; and when it has gained that perfection, therein it rests.<A 
HREF="gc3_16a.htm">*</a> The end then of everything is its 
perfection.<A HREF="gc3_16b.htm">*</a> But the perfection of everything 
is its own good.  Everything therefore is ordained to good as to its 
end.<p> 

4. Things that are aware of an end and things that are unaware of an 
end are alike ordained to an end, with this difference, that things 
that are aware of an end tend to an end of themselves, while things 
that are unaware of an end tend to an end under the direction of 
another, as appears in the case of archer and arrow.  But things that 
are aware of an end are always ordained to good for their end: for the 
will, which is the appetite of a fore-known end, never tends to 
anything except under the aspect of good, which is its object.  
Therefore things also which are unaware of an end are ordained 
to good for their end, and so good is the end of all things.<A
