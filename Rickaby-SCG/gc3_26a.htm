In this conclusion St Thomas stands by Aristotle, and is 
contradicted by Scotus and all his school. It has ever been the 
translator's intimate conviction that St Thomas and Aristotle are 
right, and the Scotists wrong, and all compromise or blending of these 
two opposite opinions impossible. Be this said to stimulate inquiry. A 
reader ought to be told when he is brought face to face with a great 
issue.
