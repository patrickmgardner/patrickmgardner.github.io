The allusion is to a doctrine, common in the
schools, that truth and falsehood, strictly speaking,
are not found in ideas and words, but in judgements
and propositions. How then is there truth in God,
if He makes no propositions? That is the difficulty.  
The answer is, that He knows what might be said of
everything, all true propositions that might be made
about it, though His mind does not express itself in
propositions, but is one simple apprehension.
