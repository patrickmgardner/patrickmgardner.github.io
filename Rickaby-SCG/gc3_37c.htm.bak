I have pointed out this subordination of practice to theory in 
<i>Practical and Moral Essays</i>, pp. 154, 155, cf. article 10, pp. 
11-13.<p> 

St Thomas proceeds to instance three kinds of contemplation. (A) 
<i>Intuition of first principles.</i> This is enjoyed by every man, 
educated and uneducated, who has the ordinary use of reason. Needless 
to say, it is not happiness, or all men would be happy. (B) 
<i>Scientific Knowledge</i>, the property of the educated. But the 
objects of science are creatures; and man requires for his happiness to 
contemplate something higher and nobler. (C) <i>Wisdom</i>, which is 
defined (in B. I, Ch. <A HREF="gc1_1.htm">I</a>: "The knowledge of 
things by their highest causes." In this <i>wisdom</i>, taken for the 
contemplation of God, the beginning and last end of all, human 
happiness will be found to consist.<p>

(A) is further suggestive of Chap. XXXVIII, in which it is shown that 
the plain man's rational knowledge of God is not happiness: while (B) 
and (C) together suggest Chap. XXXIX, which shows that the 
philosopher's knowledge of God is not happiness either. Chapter XL 
proves the same of the Christian's knowledge of God by faith. Chapter 
XLVII shows that we enjoy no vision of God on earth. Chapter XLVIII, 
that happiness is not on earth. Finally, Chap. L argues that nothing 
short of the immediate vision of God makes the happiness of angels and 
of human souls in heaven.
