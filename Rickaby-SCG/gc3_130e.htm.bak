Such an uninterrupted intention will not be
actual but virtual; that is to say, once made, it will
continue to motive conduct without further express
advertence, as the consideration of wages motives a
workman's toil. From <i>intention</i> St Thomas distinguishes
<i>attention</i>. Actual attention can no more be continous
than actual intention; and attention is nothing, if it
is not actual; there is no virtual attention. Thus in
no way can attention to God be continuous under
ordinary conditions of humanity. We have to be satisfied 
with the virtual continuity of our intention to
please God.
