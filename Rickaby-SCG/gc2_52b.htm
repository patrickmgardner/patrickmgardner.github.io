In whatever reality essence and existence are identical, that reality 
is its own existence: in other words, it exists of itself, which 
self-existence is proper to God alone. That is the whole argument of 
this chapter. All scholastic writers agree in admitting some sort of 
distinction between essence and existence in creatures: but as to the 
nature of that distinction as it obtains in existing creatures, and the 
name by which the distinction should he expressed, there has been 
fierce contention between the later Thomists and other schools. <i>Non 
nostrum inter vos tantas componere lites.</i>
