Subsistent Intelligence, which lends Efficacy to Magical Performances,

IT remains to be further investigated, what that intelligent nature is, 
by whose power these operations are carried into effect. To begin with, 
it is apparent that it is no good and praiseworthy nature. For it is 
not the behaviour of an intelligence well disposed to lend countenance 
to acts contrary to virtue. But that is what is done by magical arts: 
they usually serve to bring about adulteries, thefts, killing, and the 
like evil practices. Hence they who use such arts are called 'evil 
practitioners' (<i>malefici</i>).<p> 

3. The working of a benignant intelligence is to bring men to the 
proper good things of men, which are the good things of reason: but to 
draw men away from those good things, and allure them to trifles, is 
the conduct of an intelligence of a perverse bent. Now by these magical 
arts men make no profit in the good things of reason, which are 
sciences and virtues, but only in such trifles as the finding of things 
stolen, the catching of robbers, and the like.<p> 

4. There seems to be a certain grimace and character of 
unreasonableness attaching to the proceedings of the aforesaid arts. 
Thus they require an agent who abstains from sexual intercourse, and 
yet they are frequently employed for the procurement of sexual 
intercourse in its illicit forms.<p> 

6. As it belongs to the good to lead on to goodness, one might expect 
any right-minded intelligence to lead on to truth, truth being the 
proper good of the understanding. But the proceedings of magicians 
are generally of a character to mock men and deceive them.<p>

8. It is not the way of a rightly ordered intelligence, supposing it to 
be a superior being, to take orders from an inferior; or, supposing it 
to be an inferior, to suffer itself to be entreated as though it were a 
superior being. But magicians invoke those whose assistance they use, 
with supplication, as though they were superior beings; and then, when 
they have come, they command them as though they were inferiors.
