There seems to be some mistake here. Any careful reader of the 
<i>Contra Gentiles</i> will find in (e.g., Chapp. LXI, 1: LXXVI, note) 
indications of the want of the author's final revision, a task much 
more difficult with a manuscript than with a printed work. Every modern 
author finds sundry small corrections necessary as he is going through 
the press. The fact that the objection is based upon the self-same 
principle which St Thomas invokes in his reply to it, namely that 
neither in nothingness nor in the eternity of God can there be assigned 
any difference of instants. From this admitted principle the opponent 
argues that God must have created from all eternity. St Thomas in reply 
allows that eternity affords us no means of fixing the date of 
creation: still, he contends, we have a measure of the date in the time 
that has elapsed since, which, even though we do not know it, is a 
knowable finite quantity.
