What is the end of the path of a snow-flake?  St Thomas would 
probably have said that its end was to find the proper place of 
water, which is below air and above earth.  But in this chapter he 
returns a more scientific answer: "Every agent tends to some 
definite effect, and that is called its end."  Speaking then of 
physical agencies, and remaining in the mere physical order, all that 
the statement at the head of this chapter comes to is this, that 
physical agents work definitely and uniformly: or as Aristotle puts 
it (<i>De part. animal.</i> I, I, 34, 37, 38): "Nature does all 
things for something: . . . . everywhere we say, <i>this for 
that</i>, wherever there appears an end in which the motion 
terminates, provided nothing comes in the way: wherefore it is 
evident that there is such a thing as what we call nature: for it is 
not anything and everything that comes out of every germ, but 
<i>this out of that</i>."
