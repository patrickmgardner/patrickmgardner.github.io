<H1>That the Immutability of Divine Providence does not bar the Utility 
of Prayer</h1> 

AS the immutability of divine providence does not impose necessity on 
things foreseen, so neither does it bar the utility of prayer. For 
prayer is not poured out to God that the eternal arrangement of 
providence may be changed, -- that is impossible, -- but that man may 
gain what he desires of God. It is fitting for God to assent to the 
pious desires of His rational creatures, not that our desires move the 
immutability of God, but it is an outcome of His goodness suitably to 
carry out what we desire.<p> 

4. It is proper for friends to will the same thing.  Now God loves His 
creature  (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_91.htm">XCI</a>) and every creature 
all the more that the said creature has a share in His goodness, which 
is the prime and principal object of God's love. But, of all 
creatures, the rational creature most perfectly partakes in the divine 
goodness. God therefore wills the fulfilment of the desires of the 
rational creature. And His will is effective of things.<p> 

5. The goodness of the creature is derived in point of likeness from 
the goodness of God. But it is a point of special commendation in men, 
not to deny assent to just requests: thereupon they are called 
'liberal,' 'clement,' 'merciful and kind.' This therefore is a very 
great function of divine goodness, to hear pious prayers.<A 
HREF="gc3_95a.htm">*</a><p> 

Hence it is said: <i>He will do the will of them that fear him, and 
hear their prayers and save them</i> (Ps. cxliv, 9): <i>Every one that 
asketh receiveth, and he that seeketh findeth, and the door shall be 
opened to him that knocketh</i> (Matt. vii, 8).<p> 

<A HREF="gc3_95b.htm">*</a> From what has been said it appears that 
prayers and pious desires are causes of some things that are done by 
God. It has been shown above (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_77.htm">LXXVII</a>) 
that divine providence does not bar the working of other causes, nay, 
rather it directs them in the work of imposing upon creation the order 
which providence in its own counsels has determined upon. Thus 
secondary causes are not inconsistent with providence, but rather carry 
providence into effect. Thus then prayers are efficacious with God, not 
however as breaking through the order of divine providence, because 
this very arrangement, that such a concession be made to such a 
petitioner, falls under the order of divine providence. Therefore to 
say that we should not pray to gain any thing of God, because the order 
of His providence is unchangeable, is like saying that we should not 
walk to get to a place, nor eat to support life.<p> 

Thus a twofold error concerning prayer is excluded. Some have said that 
there is no fruit of prayer. This was said as well on the part of those 
who denied divine providence, as the Epicureans did; as also on the 
part of those who withdrew human affairs from divine providence, as 
some of the Peripatetics did; as also on the part of those who thought 
that all things happen of necessity, as the Stoics did. From all these 
tenets it would follow that prayer is fruitless, and consequently all 
divine worship in vain:<A HREF="gc3_95c.htm">*</a> which error is 
referred to in Malachy iii, 14: <i>Ye have said: he laboureth in vain 
who serveth God, and what profit is it that we have kept his 
ordinances, and that we have walked sad before the Lord of Hosts?</i><p> 

There were others on the contrary who said that the divine arrangement 
was reversible by prayer. And the <i>prima facie</i> rendering of 
certain texts of scripture seems to favour this view. Thus, after 
Isaias by divine command had said to King Ezechias: <i>Put thine house 
in order, for thou shalt die and not live</i>; yet upon Ezechias's 
prayer the word of the Lord came to Isaias, saying: <i>Go and tell 
Ezechias: I have heard thy prayer, lo I will add to thy days fifteen 
years</i> (Isa. xxxviii, 1-5). Again it is said in the person of the 
Lord: <i>I will suddenly speak against a nation and against a kingdom, 
to root out and pull down and destroy it. If that nation against which 
I have spoken shall repent of their evil, I also will repent of the 
evil that I have thought to do to them</i> (Jer. xviii, 7, 8); <i>Turn 
to the Lord your God, for he is gracious and merciful: who knoweth but 
he will turn and forgive?</i> (Joel ii, 13, 14.) But against construing 
these texts to mean that the will of God is changeable, or that 
anything happens to God in time, or that temporal events in creation 
are the cause of anything coming to exist in God, there are other 
authorities of Holy Writ, containing infallible and express truth. Thus 
it is said: <i>God is not as man, that he should die, nor as the son 
of man, that he should change. Has he said then and shall not do? 
Has he spoken and shall not fulfil?</i> (Num. xxiii, 19): <i>The 
victorious one in Israel will not spare, and will not be moved to 
repentance: for he is not a man that he should repent</i> (1 Kings xv, 
29): <i>I am the Lord and change not</i> (Malach. iii, 6).<p> 

On careful consideration it will appear that all mistakes in this 
matter arise from failing to note the difference between the system of 
the universe and any particular system (<i>universalem ordinem et 
particularem</i>). There is nothing to hinder any particular system
being changed, whether by prayer or by any other means; for there is 
that existing beyond the bounds of the system which is capable of 
changing it. But beyond the system that embraces all things nothing can 
be posited whereby such system could possibly be changed, depending as 
it does on the universal cause. Therefore the Stoics laid it down that 
the system established by God could nowise be changed. But they failed 
in a right appreciation of this general system in supposing that 
prayers were useless, which was taking for granted that the wills of 
men, and their desires whence their prayers proceed, are not 
comprehended in that general system. For when they say that the same 
effect follows whether prayers are put up or not, -- follows, that is, as 
part of the univeral system of things, -- they manifestly reserve and 
except prayers as not entering into that general system. Supposing 
prayers included in the system, then effects will follow from them by 
divine appointment as from other causes. One might as well exclude the 
effects of other every-day causes as exclude the effect of prayer. And 
if the immutability of the divine plan does not withdraw the effects 
of other causes, neither does it take away the efficacy of prayer.<p> 

Prayers then avail, not as changing a system arranged from eternity, 
but as being themselves part of that system. And there is no 
difficulty in the efficacy of prayer changing the particular system of 
some inferior cause, by the doing of God, who overpasses all causes, 
and who consequently is not bound by the necessity of any system 
depending on any cause; but on the contrary every necessity of system 
dependent on any inferior cause is checked by Him, as having been 
instituted by Him.<A HREF="gc3_95d.htm">*</a> Inasmuch then as pious 
prayers avail to alter some points of the system of inferior causes 
that was established by God, God is said to 'turn,' or 'repent.' Hence 
Gregory says that God does not change His counsel, though He sometimes 
changes His sentence, not the sentence which declares His eternal 
arrangements, but the sentence which declares the order of inferior 
causes, according to which Ezechias was to die, or some nation to be 
punished for its sins. Such change of sentence is called in 
metaphorical language 'repentance,' inasmuch as God behaves like one 
repentant, to whom it belongs to change what He has done. In the same 
way God is said metaphorically to be 'angry,' inasmuch as by punishing 
He produces the effect of anger. (B. I, Chap. <A
