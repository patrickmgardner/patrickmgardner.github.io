Does not this argument prove too much, either
that in man too essence and will are the same, or
that the human will is an accident to human 
substance? St Thomas would reply by a distinction 
between <i>act</i> and <i>faculty</i>.  In God, the distinction does
not obtain. Act and faculty are one in Him, one
with His essence.  But in man <i>act</i> and <i>faculty</i> are 
distinct. The act of volition is accidental in man, it
comes and it goes: but the faculty or power of willing 
is not an accident to human substance, it is in
essential property of the same.
