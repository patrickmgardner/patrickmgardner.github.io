There follows a discussion of John xiii, 1: xviii, 28, as compared with 
the Synoptics. See <i>Scripture Manuals for Catholic Schools, St 
Matthew</i>, pp. 217-9: <i>St John</i>, pp. 94-5. Either of the two 
views taken by modern scholars holds with the employment of unleavened 
bread at the institution of the Holy Eucharist. To be well within the 
law, the Jews of the time had all the leaven removed from their houses 
by sundown on the 13th Nisan, which evening is the earlier of the two 
assignable dates for the Last Supper.<p>
