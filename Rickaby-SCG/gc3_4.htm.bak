<H1>That Evil in things is beside the Intention of the Agent</h1>

What follows from an action different from what was intended by the 
agent, manifestly happens beside his intention.  But evil is 
different from good, which every agent intends.  Therefore evil 
happens beside the intention.<p>

2. Failure in effect and action follows upon some defect in the 
principles of action, as a halting gait follows upon crookedness of 
legs.  Now an agent acts by whatever of active power he has, not by 
what defect of active power he suffers; and according as he acts, so 
does he intend his end.  He intends therefore an end answering to 
his power.  Anything therefore that ensues answering to defect of 
power will be beside the intention of the agent.  But such is evil.<p>

4. In agents that act by intellect, or by any sort of judgement,<A 
HREF="gc3_4a.htm">*</a> intention follows apprehension: for intention 
tends to that which is apprehended as an end.  If then experience 
lights upon something not of the species apprehended, the event will be 
beside the intention: thus if one intends to eat honey, and eats gall, 
taking it for honey, that will be beside the intention.  But every 
intellectual agent intends a thing according as he takes it for 
something good: if then it turns out not to be good but evil, that will 
be beside the intention.
