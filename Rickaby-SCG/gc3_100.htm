<H1>That the things which God does beyond the Order of Nature are not 
contrary to Nature<A HREF="gc3_100a.htm">*</a></h1>

SINCE God is prime agent, all things inferior to Him are as His 
instruments. But instruments are made to serve the end of the prime 
agent, according as they are moved by Him: therefore it is not contrary 
to, but very much in accordance with, the nature of the instrument, for 
it to be moved by the prime agent. Neither is it contrary to nature for 
created things to be moved in any way whatsoever (<i>qualitercunque</i>) 
by God: for they were made to serve Him.<A HREF="gc3_100b.htm">*</a><p> 

4. The first measure of every being and of every nature is God, seeing 
that He is the first being and canse of being to all. And since 
everything must be judged by its measure, that must be called 'natural' 
to a thing whereby it is conformed to its measure, or standard. That 
then will be natural to a thing, which has been put into it by God. 
Therefore, thou~h something further be impressed upon a thing, making 
it otherwise than as it was before, that is not against nature.<A

5. All creatures stand to God as the products of art to the artist (B. 
II, Chap. <A HREF="gc2_24.htm">XXIV</a>). Hence all nature may be 
called an artistic product of divine workmanship (<i>artificiatum 
divinae artis</i>). But it is not contrary to the notion of workmanship 
for the artist to work something to a different effect in his work, 
even after he has given it the first form. Neither then is it contrary 
to nature if God works something in natural things to a different 
effect from that which the ordinary course of nature involves.<p> 

Hence Augustine says: "God, the Creator and Founder of all natures, 
does nothing contrary to nature, because to every creature that is 
natural which He makes so, of whom is all measure, number and order of 
nature.<A HREF="gc3_100d.htm">*</a>
