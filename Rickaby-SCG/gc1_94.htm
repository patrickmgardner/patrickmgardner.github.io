<H1>That the Contemplative (Intellectual) Virtues
are in God</h1>

IF Wisdom consists in the knowledge of the highest causes; and God 
chiefly knows Himself, and knows nothing except by knowing Himself, as 
the first cause of all (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_46.htm">XLVI</a>), it is 
evident that Wisdom ought to be attributed to God in the first place. 
Hence it is said: <i>He is wise of heart</i> (Job ix, 4.); and, <i>All 
wisdom is of the Lord God, and hath been with him alway</i> (Ecclus i, 
1).  The Philosopher also says at the beginning of his Metaphysics that 
Wisdom is a divine possession, not a human.<p>

2. If Knowledge (Science) is an acquaintance with a thing through its 
proper cause, and God knows the order of all causes and effects, and 
thereby the several proper causes of individual things (Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc1_45.htm">LXV</a>, <A HREF="gc1_47.htm">LXVII</a>), it is 
manifest that Knowledge (Science) is properly in God; hence <i>God is 
the Lord of sciences</i> (I Kings ii, 3)<p> 

3. If the immaterial cognition of things, attained without discussion, 
is Understanding (Intuition),<A HREF="gc1_94a.htm">*</a> God has such a 
cognition of all things (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_50.htm">L</a>); and 
therefore there is in Him Understanding.  Hence, <i>He hath counsel and 
understanding</i> (Job xii, 13).
