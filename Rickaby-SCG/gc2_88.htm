<H1>Arguments against the Truth of the Conclusion last drawn, with 
their Solution</h1> 

For the better understanding of the solutions given, we must prefix 
some exposition of the order and process of human generation, and of 
animal generation generally. First then we must know that that is a 
false opinion of certain persons who say that the vital acts which 
appear in the embryo before its final development (<i>ante ultimum 
complementum</i>), come not from any soul or power of soul existing in 
it, but from the soul of the mother.<A HREF="gc2_88a.htm>*</a> If that 
were true, we could no longer call the embryo an animal, as every 
animal consists of soul and body. The activities of life do not 
proceed from an active principle from without, but from a power within; 
a fact which seems to mark the distinction between inanimate and living 
things, it being proper to the latter to move themselves. Whatever is 
nourished, assimilates nourishment to itself: hence there must be in 
the creature that is nourished an active power of nutrition, since an 
agent acts to the likeness of itself. This is still more manifest in 
the operations of sense: for sight and hearing are attributable to a 
power existing in the sentient subject, not in another. Hence, as the 
embryo is evidently nourished before its final development, and even 
feels, this cannot be attributed to the soul of another.<p> 

It has been alleged that the soul in its complete essence is in the 
male <i>semen</i> from the first, its activities not appearing merely 
for want of organs. But that cannot be. For since the soul is united 
with the body as a form, it is only united with that body of which it 
is properly the actualisation. Now the soul is the actualisation of an 
organised body. Therefore before the organisation of the body the soul 
is in the male <i>semen</i>, not actually, but virtually. Hence 
Aristotle says that seed and fruit have life potentially in such a way 
that they "cast away," i.e. are destitute of soul; whereas that (body) 
whereof the soul is the actualisation has life potentially, and does 
not "cast away" soul.<A HREF="gc2_88b.htm>*</a><p> 

It would follow, if the soul were in the male <i>semen</i> from the 
first, that the generation of an animal was only by fissure (<i>per 
decisionem</i>), as is the case with Annelid animals, that are made two 
out of one. For if the male <i>semen</i> has a soul the instant it was 
cut off from the body,<A HREF="gc2_88d.htm>*</a> it would then have a 
substantial form. But every substantial generation precedes and does 
not follow the substantial form. Any transmutations that follow the 
substantial form are not directed to the being of the thing generated, 
but to its well-being. At that rate the generation of the animal would 
be complete in the mere cutting off of the male <i>semen</i> from the 
body of the parent; and all subsequent transmutations would be 
irrelevant to generation. The supposition is still more ridiculous 
when applied to the rational soul, as well because it is impossible for 
that to be divided according to the division of the body, so as even to 
be in the <i>semen</i> cut off therefrom; as also because it would 
follow that in all cases of the <i>semen</i> being wasted, without 
conception ensuing, souls were still multiplied.<p> 

Nor again can it be said, as some say, that though there is not in the 
male <i>semen</i> at its first cutting off<A HREF="gc2_88e.htm>*</a> 
any soul actually, but only virtually, for want of organs, 
nevertheless, as the said <i>semen</i> is a bodily substance, 
organisable although not organised, so the active power of that 
<i>semen</i> is itself a soul, potential but not actual, proportional 
to the condition of the <i>semen</i>. The theory goes on to say that, 
as the life of a plant requires fewer organs than the life of an 
animal, the aforesaid active power turns into a vegetative soul as soon 
as the <i>semen</i> is sufficiently organised for the life of a plant; 
and further that, when the organs are more perfected and multiplied, 
the same power is advanced to be a sentient soul; and further still 
that, when the form of the organs is perfect, the same becomes a 
rational soul, not indeed by the action of the power of the 
<i>semen</i> itself, but only by the influence of some exterior agent: 
and this the advocates of this theory take to be the reason why 
Aristotle said (<i>De gen. animal.</i>, II, iii) that the intellect is 
from without.<p> 

Upon this view it would follow that numerically the same active power 
was now a vegetative soul only, and afterwards a sentient soul; and so 
the substantial form itself was continually more and more perfected: it 
would further follow that a substantial form was educed from 
potentiality to actuality, not instantaneously, but successively; and 
further than generation was a continuous change, as is alteration, -- 
all so many physical impossibilities. There would ensue even a still 
more awkward consequence, that the rational soul was mortal. For no 
formal constituent added to a perishable thing makes it naturally 
imperishable: otherwise the perishable would be changed into the 
imperishable, which is impossible, as the two differ in kind. But the 
substance of the sentient soul, which is supposed to be incidentally 
generated when the body is generated in the process above described, is 
necessarily perishable with the perishing of the body. If therefore 
this soul becomes rational by the bringing in of some manner of light 
from without<A HREF="gc2_88f.htm>*</a> to be a formal constituent of 
the soul, it necessarily follows that the rational soul perishes when 
the body perishes, contrary to which has been shown (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_79.htm">LXXIX</a>) and to the teaching of Catholic faith.<p> 

Therefore the active power which is cut off, or emitted, with the male 
<i>semen</i> from the body, and is called 'formative,'<A 
HREF="gc2_88g.htm>*</a> is not itself the soul, nor ever becomes the 
soul in the process of generation. But the frothy substance of the 
male <i>semen</i> contains gas (<i>spiritus</i>), and this gas is the 
subject on which the formative power rests, and in which it is 
inherent.<A HREF="gc2_88h.htm>*</a> So the formative power works out 
the formation of the body, acting in virtue of the soul of the father, 
the prime author of generation, not in virtue of the soul of the 
offspring, even after the offspring comes to have a soul: for the 
offspring does not generate itself, but is generated by the father.<A 
HREF="gc2_88i.htm>*</a> This is clear by enumeration of the several 
powers of the soul. The formation is not attributable to the soul of 
the embryo itself on the score of that soul's generative power: for 
that power puts forth no activity till the work of nutrition and growth 
is complete; and besides, its work is not directed to the perfection of 
the individual, but to the preservation of the species. Nor can it be 
assigned to the embryo's nutritive power, the work of which is to 
assimilate nourishment to the body nourished; for in this case there is 
no room for such a work; since nourishment taken while the body is in 
formation is not applied to assume the likeness of a pre-existent body, 
but goes to the production of a more perfect form and a nearer approach 
to the likeness of the father. Nor is the development of the embro 
attributable to its own power of growth: for to power of growth there 
does not belong change of form, but only change in bulk. And as for 
the sensitive and intellectual powers, it is clear that theirs is no 
office bearing on such a development. It follows that the formation of 
the body, particularly of its earliest and principal parts, does not 
proceed from the engendered soul, nor from any formative power acting 
in virtue thereof, but from a formative power acting in virtue of the 
generative soul of the father, the work of which is to make another 
like in species to the progenitor. This formative power therefore 
remains the same in the subject aforesaid<A HREF="gc2_88j.htm>*</a> 
from the beginning of the formation even to the end. But the 
appearance of the being under formation does not remain the same: for 
first it has the appearance of <i>semen</i>, afterwards of blood, and 
so on until it arrives at its final completeness.<p> 

Nor need we be uneasy in admitting the generation of an intermediate 
product, the existence of which is presently after broken off, because 
such transitional links are not complete in their species, but are on 
the way to a perfect species; and therefore they are not engendered to 
endure, but as stages of being, leading up to finality in the order of 
generation. The higher a form is in the scale of being, and the 
further it is removed from a mere material form, the more intermediate 
forms and intermediate generation must be passed through before the 
finally perfect form is reached.<A HREF="gc2_88k.htm>*</a> Therefore 
in the generation of animal and man, -- these having the most perfect 
form, -- there occur many intermediate forms and generations, and 
consequently destructions, because the generation of one being is the 
destruction of another. The vegetative soul therefore, which is first 
in the embryo, while it lives the life of a plant, is destroyed, and 
there succeeds a more perfect soul, which is at one nutrient and 
sentient, and for that time the embryo lives the life of an animal: 
upon the destruction of this, there succeeds the rational soul, infused 
from without, whereas the preceding two owed their existence to the 
virtue of the male <i>semen</i>.<A HREF="gc2_88l.htm>*</a><p> 

With these principles recognised, it is easy to answer the 
objections.<p> 

<i>Arg. 1.</i> Man being an animal by the possession of a sentient 
soul, and the notion of 'animal' befitting man in the same sense as it 
befits other animals, it appears that the sentient soul of man is of 
the same kind as the souls of other animals. But things of the same 
kind have the same manner of coming to be. Therefore the sentient soul 
of man, as of other animals, comes to be by the active power that is in 
the male <i>semen</i>. But the sentient and the intelligent soul in 
man is one in substance (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_58.htm">LVIII</a>). It 
appears then that even the intelligent soul is produced by the active 
power of the <i>semen</i>.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i> Though sensitive soul in man and brute agree 
generically, yet they differ specifically. As the animal, man, 
differs specifically from other animals by being rational, so the 
sentient soul of a man differs specifically from the sentient soul of a 
brute by being also intelligent. The soul therefore of a brute has 
sentient attributes only, and consequently neither its being nor its 
activity rises above the order of the body: hence it must be generated 
with the generation of the body, and perish with its destruction. But 
the sentient soul in man, over and above its sentient nature, has 
intellectual power: hence the very substance of this soul must be 
raised above the bodily order both in being and in activity; and 
therefore it is neither generated by the generation of the body, nor 
perishes by its destruction.<p>

<i>Arg. 2.</i> As Aristotle teaches, in point of time the foetus is an 
animal before it is a man.<A HREF="gc2_88m.htm">*</a> But while it is 
an animal and not yet a man, it has a sentient and not an intelligent 
soul, which sentient soul beyond doubt is produced by the active power 
of the male <i>semen</i>. Now that self-same sentient soul is 
potentially intelligent, even as that animal is potentially a rational 
animal: unless one chooses to say that the intelligent soul which 
supervenes is another substance altogether, a conclusion rejected above 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc2_58.htm">LVIII</a>). It appears then that the 
substance of the intelligent soul comes of the active power that is in 
the <i>semen</i>.<A HREF="gc2_88n.htm">*</a><p> 

<i>Reply.</i> The sentient soul, whereby the human foetus was an 
animal, does not last, but its place is taken by a soul that is at once 
sentient and intelligent.<p> 

<i>Arg. 3.</i> The soul, as it is the form of the body, is one being 
with the body. But unity of thing produced, unity of productive 
action, and unity of producing agent, all go together. Therefore the 
one being of soul and body must be the result of one productive action 
of one productive agent. But confessedly the body is produced by the 
productive action of the power that is in the male <i>semen</i>. 
Therefore the soul also, as it is the form of the body, is produced by 
the same productive action, and not by any separate agency.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> The principle of corresponding unity of produced, 
production, and producer, holds good to the exclusion of a plurality of 
productive agents not acting in co-ordination with one another. Where 
they are co-ordinate, several agents have but one effect. Thus the 
prime efficient cause acts to the production of the effect of the 
secondary efficient cause even more vigorously than the secondary cause 
itself; and we see that the effect produced by a principal agent 
through the agency of an instrument is more properly attributed to the 
principal agent than to the instrument. Sometimes too the action of 
the principal agent reaches to some part of the thing done, to which 
the action of the instrument does not reach. Since then the whole 
active power of nature stands to God as an instrument to the prime and 
principal agent, we find no difficulty in the productive action of 
nature being terminated to a part only of that one term of generation, 
man, and not to the whole of what is produced by the action of God. 
The body then of man is formed at once by the power of God, the 
principal and prime agent, and by the power of the <i>semen</i>, the 
secondary agent. But the action of God produces the human soul, which 
the power of the male <i>semen</i> cannot produce, but only dispose 
thereto.<A HREF="gc2_88o.htm>*</a><p>

<i>Arg. 4.</i> Man generates his own specific likeness by the power 
that is in the detached <i>semen</i>, which generation means causing 
the specific form of the generated. The human soul therefore, the 
specific form of man, is caused by the power in the <i>semen</i>.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i> Man generates his specific likeness, inasmuch as the 
power of his <i>semen</i> operates to prepare for the coming of the 
final form which gives the species to man.<p>

<i>Arg. 5.</i> If souls are created by God, He puts the last hand to 
the engendering of children born sometimes of adultery.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> There is no difficulty in that. Not the nature of 
adulterers is evil, but their will: now the effect which their 
<i>semen</i> produces is natural, not voluntary: hence there is no 
difficulty in God's co-operating to that effect and giving it 
completeness.<p>

In a book ascribed to Gregory of Nyssa<A HREF="gc2_88p.htm>*</a> there 
are found further arguments, as follows:<p> 

<i>Arg. 6.</i> Soul and body make one whole, that is, one man. If 
then the soul is made before the body, or the body before the soul, the 
same thing will be prior and posterior to itself. Therefore body and 
soul are made together. But the body begins in the cutting off, or 
emission, of the <i>semen</i>. Therefore the soul also is brought into 
being by the same.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> Allowing that the human body is formed before the soul 
is created, or conversely, still it does not follow that the same man 
is prior to himself: for man is not his body or his soul. It only 
follows that one part of him is prior to another part; and in that 
there is no difficulty: for matter is prior in time to form, -- matter, 
I mean, inasmuch as it is in potentiality to form, not inasmuch as it 
is actually perfected by form, for so it is together with form. The 
human body then, inasmuch as it is in potentiality to soul, as not yet 
having the soul, is prior in time to the soul: but, for that time, it 
is not actually human, only potentially so: but when it is actually 
human, as being perfected by a human soul, it is neither prior nor 
posterior to the soul, but together with it.<p>

<i>Arg. 7.</i> An agent's activity seems to be imperfect, when he does 
not produce and bring the whole thing into being, but only half makes 
it. If then God brought the soul into being, while the body was formed 
by the power of the male <i>semen</i>, body and soul being the two 
parts of man, the activities of God and of the seminal power would be 
both imperfect. Therefore the body and soul of man are both produced 
by the same cause. But certainly the body of man is produced by the 
power of the <i>semen</i>: therefore also the soul.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> Body and soul are both produced by the power of God, 
though the formation of the body is of God through the intermediate 
instrumentality of the power of the natural <i>semen</i>, while the 
soul He produces immediately. Neither does it follow that the action 
of the power of the <i>semen</i> is imperfect, since it fulfils the 
purpose of its existence.<p>

<i>Arg. 8.</i> In all things that are engendered of seed, the parts of 
the thing engendered are all contained together in the seed, though 
they do not actually appear: as we see that in wheat or in any other 
send the green blade and stalk and knots and grains and ears are 
virtually contained in the original seed; and afterwards the seed 
gathers bulk and expansion by a process of natural consequence leading 
to its perfection, without taking up any new feature from without. 
But the soul is part of man. Therefore in the male <i>semen</i> of man 
the human soul is virtually contained, and it does not take its origin 
from any exterior cause.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> In seed are virtually contained all things that do not 
transcend corporeal power, as grass, stalk, knots, and the like: from 
which there is no concluding that the special element in man which 
transcends the whole range of corporeal power is virtually contained in 
the seed.<p>

<i>Arg. 9.</i> Things that have the same development and the same 
consummation must have the same first origin. But in the generation of 
man we find the same development and the same consummation: for as the 
configuration and growth of the limbs advances, the activities of the 
soul show themselves more and more: for first appears the activity of 
the sentient soul, and last of all, when the body is complete, the 
activity of the intelligent soul. Therefore body and soul have the 
same origin. But the first origin of the body is in the emission of 
the male <i>semen</i>: such therefore also is the origin of the soul.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> All that this shows is that a certain arrangement of the 
parts of the body is necessary for the activity of the soul.<p>

<i>Arg. 10.</i> What is conformed to a thing, is set up according to 
the plan of that to which it is conformed, as wax takes the impress of 
a seal. But the body of man and of every animal is conformed to its 
own soul, having such disposition of organs as suits the activities of 
the power to be exercised through those organs. The body then is 
formed by the action of the soul: hence also Aristotle says that the 
soul is the efficient cause of the body.<A HREF="gc2_88q.htm>*</a> 
This could not be, if the soul were not in the male <i>semen</i>: for 
the body is formed by the power that is in that <i>semen</i>: therefore 
the soul has its origin in that emission of it.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i> That the body is conformed and fashioned according to 
the soul, and that therefore the soul prepares a body like unto itself, 
is a statement partly true and partly false. Understood of the soul of 
the generator, it is true: understood of the soul of the generated, it 
is false. The formation of the body in its prime and principal parts 
is not due to the soul of the generated, but to the soul of the 
generator, as has been shown.<p>

<i>Arg. 11.</i> Nothing lives except by a soul. But the male 
<i>semen</i> is alive, of which fact there are three indications. In 
the first place, the <i>semen</i> is cut off and detached from a living 
being: secondly, there appears in it vital heat and activity: thirdly, 
the seeds of plants, committed to earth, could never warm to life from 
the lifeless earth, had they not life in themselves.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> The <i>semen</i> is not alive actually, but potentially, 
and has a soul, not actually, but virtually.<A HREF="gc2_88r.htm>*</a> 
In the process of generation the embryo comes to have a vegetative and 
a sentient soul by the virtue of the <i>semen</i>, which souls do not 
endure, but pass away and are succeeded by a rational soul.<p> 

<i>Arg. 12.</i> If the soul is not before the body (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_83.htm">LXXXIII</a>), nor begins with the liberation of the 
<i>semen</i>, it follows that the body is first formed, and afterwards 
there is infused into it a soul newly created. But if this is true, it 
follows further that the soul is for the body: for what is for another 
appears after it, as clothes are for men and are made after them. But 
that is false: rather the body is for he soul, as the end is ever the 
more noble. We must say then that the origin of the soul is 
simultaneous with the emission of the <i>semen</i>.<A 
HREF="gc2_88s.htm>*</a><p> 

<i>Reply.</i> There are two ways of one thing being 'for another.' A 
thing may be to serve the activity, or secure the preservation, or 
otherwise promote the good of another, presupposing its being; and such 
things are posterior to that for which they are, as clothes for the 
person, or tools for the mechanic. Or a thing may be 'for another' in 
view of that other's being: what is thus 'for another' is prior to it 
in time and posterior to it in nature. In this latter way the body is 
for the soul, as all matter is for its form. The case would be 
otherwise, if soul and body did not make one being, as they say who 
take the soul not to be the form of the body.<A HREF="gc2_88t.htm>*</a><p>
