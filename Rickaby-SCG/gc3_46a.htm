St Augustine here, as his manner is, says things which remain difficult 
after all explanations given. He finds some analogy to the Blessed 
Trinity in the human soul thus: "The mind itself and its love and 
knowledge of itself are three things; and these three are one; and when 
they are perfect, they are equal." This thought he pursues, <i>De 
Trinitate</i> IX, Chapp. iii, iv: X, Chapp. iii-x. It makes to his 
purpose to insist on the equality of the soul's knowledge of itself to 
the soul as known. "When it knows its whole self, and nothing else with 
itself, then its knowledge is equal to itself" (<i>De Trin.</i> IX, 
iv). He frequently repeats that the soul  knows its whole self. See 
especially X, iv, 6. St Thomas would explain: The soul knows its whole 
self in existence (<i>quod est</i>), but not its whole self in essence 
(<i>quid est</i>): which is true, but what St Augustine meant is not so 
clear. Cf. <i>De Trin.</i> X, x, 16: "In no way is a thing rightly said 
to be known, while its substance is unknown: wherefore, when the mind 
knows itself, it knows its substance; and when it is certain of itself, 
it is certain of its substance." Perhaps we may say that every mind has 
some limited certain knowledge as well of its own existence as of its 
own substance, but not an adequate knowledge of its own substance, else 
there would be no bad psychology.
