<H1>That God's Power is His Substance</h1> 

Active power belongs to the perfection of a thing. But every divine 
perfection is contained in God's own being (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>). God's power therefore is not different 
from his being. But God is His own being (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_22.htm">XXII</a>); He is therefore His own power.<p> 

4. In things the powers of which are not their substance, the said 
powers are accidents.<A HREF="gc2_8a.htm">*</a> But there can be no 
accident in God (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_23.htm">XXIII</a>), who is 
therefore his own power.
