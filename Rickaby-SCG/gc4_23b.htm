The miraculous gifts, usual in the early Church
(1 Cor xii, xiv), were part of this visible mission of
the Holy Ghost: cf. Acts x, 44-46. Indeed we may
say that the visible Church down to the present day
is a continuation of that visible mission of the Spirit,
who abides with the Church for ever (John xiv, 16),
animating and informing the body of the Church,
and who in that body is still made manifest to the
world, after the miraculous <i>charismata</i> have ceased,
and the appearances of the Baptismal Dove and the
Pentecostal Fire have become events of remote 
antiquity.
