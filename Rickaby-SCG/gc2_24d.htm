A formal logician might quarrel with this argument: 'All work of 
intelligence and wisdom is a setting of things in order; therefore all 
setting of things in order is a work of intelligence and wisdom:' an 
illogical conversion. St Thomas however does not argue in that way.  He 
gives us to understand that to set things in order is a peculiar work 
of intelligence, which cannot be done by chance, least of all when the 
things ordered are complex and manifold, as are the endless details of 
nature. Chance events, as Aristotle observes, are rareties and 
exceptions: the course of nature, so uniform, or so seldom varied, 
cannot be the work of chance. Thus that very uniformity of nature now 
taken to militate against religion, is taken by St Thomas for an 
argument of divine contrivance.
