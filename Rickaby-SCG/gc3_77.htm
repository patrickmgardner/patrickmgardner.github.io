<H1>That the arrangements of Divine Providence are carried into 
execution by means of Secondary Causes</h1>

IT belongs to the dignity of a ruler to have many ministers and 
diversity of servants to carry his command into execution, the height 
and greatness of his lordship appearing by the multitude of persons of 
various ranks who are subject to him: but no dignity of any ruler is 
comparable with the dignity of the divine government: it is suitable 
therefore that the arrangements of divine providence be carried into 
execution by divers grades of agents.<p> 

6. As the cause is superior to the effect, the order of causes is 
nobler than that of effects: in that order therefore the perfection of 
divine providence is better shown. But if there were not intermediate 
causes carrying divine providence into execution, there would be in 
creation no order of causes, but only of effects. The perfection 
therefore of divine providence requires that there should be 
intermediate causes carrying it into execution.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Bless the Lord, all his powers, ye ministers that 
do his word</i> (Ps. cii, 21): <i>Fire, hail, snow, stormy winds that do 
his word</i> (Ps. cxlviii, 8).
