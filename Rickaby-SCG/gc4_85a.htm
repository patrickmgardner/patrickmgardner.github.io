<i>Anima in ipsum perfecte dominabitur quantum ad hoc 
quod ipsum vivificet</i> (see further Chap. <A 
HREF="gc4_86.htm">LXXXVI</a>).
This axiom seems to furnish the key to the whole
situation of risen humanity. No longer dependent on
energy supplied from external nature in the shape of
food and oxygen, man's soul shall breathe its own
spiritual energy direct into his body. The case is
otherwise with mortal man. Whatever in us the will
insists on having done, even the very act of the will
so insisting, is paid for out of the store of physical
energy belonging to the body, and latent somewhere
in the animal system. Witness the reaction and prostration 
that follows sooner or later upon every
heroic effort. The effort is only made by what we
may call a forced loan of bodily energy, raised by the
will, or rather by the man willing,  for the will is
not a motor power distinct, but belongs to the 'form'
of the body. But in man risen and immortal, the soul
(to use an expressive vulgarism) shall <i>run the body</i>, not
merely by directing and whipping up bodily energy,
but by communication to the body of the soul's own
energy, proper to it as a spiritual substance, the
energy of a spirit either <b>isaggelos</b> (which Luke xx,
36, seems rather to imply), or <i>minished a little less than
the angels</i> (Ps. viii, spoken of mortal man).<p>
