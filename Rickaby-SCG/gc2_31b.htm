It is now generally recognised that the stellar universe, 
inconceivably vast as are its dimensions, nevertheless is limited in 
space: whence it may plausibly be argued to be limited in duration 
also, in the sense of not having existed from eternity. Where 
there is no matter, neither is there any <i>place</i>, nor any 
<i>marked out extension</i>: but there is an unfulfilled extensibility, 
or <i>absolute space</i>, which is founded upon the immensity of God. 
In like manner, when as yet creatures were not, there was no 
<i>time</i>, as there was no <i>motion</i>, nor any body to move. There 
was only a potentiality of time, founded upon the eternity of God. 
Creatures have been from the beginning of time, as Plato saw 
(<i>Timaeus</i> 37, 38), but they cannot be argued to have been from 
eternity, eternally coexistent with God, unless they be argued to be 
necessary to God, in which case they cease to be creatures.
