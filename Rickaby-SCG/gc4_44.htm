<H1>That the Human Nature, assumed by the Word, was perfect in Soul and 
Body in the instant of Conception</h1>

THE Word of God took a body through the medium of a rational soul: for 
the body of man is not more assumable by God than other bodies except 
for the rational soul.<A HREF="gc4_44a.htm">*</a> The Word of God then 
did not assume a body without a rational soul. Since then the Word of 
God assumed a body from the first instant of conception, in that very 
instant the rational soul must have been united with the body.<p> 

4. The body which the Word assumed was formed from the first instant of 
conception, because it would have been against the fitness of things 
for the Word of God to have assumed anything that was formless. 
Moreover the soul, like any other natural form, requires its proper 
matter. Now the proper matter of the soul is an organised body: for  
"the soul is the actualisation of an organic, natural body, that is in 
potentiality to life."<A HREF="gc4_44b.htm">*</a> If then the soul was 
united with the body from the first instant of conception, the body 
must needs have been organised and formed from the first instant of 
conception. Moreover in the order of the stages of generation the 
organisation of the body precedes the introduction of the rational 
soul: hence, positing the latter, we must posit the former stage also. 
But increase in quantity up to the due measure may very well be 
subsequent to the animation of the body. Thus then, concerning the 
conception of the Man assumed, we must think that in the very instant 
of conception His body was organised and formed, but had not as yet its 
due quantity.<A HREF="gc4_44c.htm">*</a><p>
