<H1>How in that Final Happiness every Desire of Man is fulfilled</h1>

FROM what has been said it evidently appears that in that final 
happiness which comes of the vision of God every human desire is 
fulfilled, according to the text: <i>Who filleth thy desire with good 
things</i> (Ps. cii, 5). And every human endeavour there finds its 
final good: as may be seen by discussing the several heads. -- I. As 
man is an intelligent being, there is in him a desire of investigating 
truth, which desire men follow out in the pursuit of a contemplative 
life. And this will manifestly be fulfilled in that vision, since by 
the sight of the first and highest truth all things that man naturally 
desires to know will become known to him (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_50.htm">L</a>).<p> 

2. There is also a desire which a man has in keeping with his rational 
faculty of managing and disposing of inferior things: which desire men 
prosecute in the pursuit of an active and civil life. And the chief 
scope and purpose of this desire is the laying out of man's whole life 
according to reason, which means living virtuously.<A 
HREF="gc3_63a.htm">*</a> This desire will then be altogether fulfilled 
when reason shall be in the height of its vigour, being enlightened by 
divine light that it may not fall away from what is right.<p> 

3. Upon civil life there follow certain goods which a man needs for his 
social and political activities. Thus there is honour and high estate, 
the inordinate desire of which makes men intriguing<A 
HREF="gc3_63b.htm">*</a> and ambitious. But that vision elevates men to 
the supreme height of honour, uniting them with God; and therefore, as 
God is the <i>king of ages</i> (1 Tim. i, 17), so the Blessed united with Him 
are said to reign: <i>They shall reign with Christ</i> (Apoc. xx, 6).<p> 

4. Another object of desire following upon civil life is celebrity of 
fame, by inordinate desire of which men are said to be covetous of vain 
glory. By that divine vision the blessed become celebrated, not before 
men, who may deceive and be deceived, but in the most true knowledge of 
God and of all their companions in bliss. And therefore that happiness 
is very frequently termed 'glory' in Holy Scripture, as in Ps. cxliv, 
5: <i>The saints shall exult in glory</i>.<p> 

5. There is also another thing desirable in civil society, namely, 
riches, by inordinate craving and love for which men become illiberal 
and unjust. But in that blissful state there is sufficiency of all good 
things, inasmuch as the Blessed enjoy Him who comprises the perfection 
of them: wherefore it is said: <i>All good things came to me with 
her</i> (Wisdom vii, 11); and, Glory and wealth is in this house</i> 
(Ps. cxi, 3).<p> 

6. There is also a third desire in man, common to him with other 
animals, the desire of pleasurable enjoyments, which men pursue in the 
life of pleasure, and thereby become intemperate and incontinent.<A 
HREF="gc3_63c.htm">*</a> But in the happiness of the sight of God there 
is perfect delight, all the more perfect than the pleasure of sense, 
which brute animals also can enjoy, as intellect is higher than sense; 
all the more perfect as (<i>quanto</i>) the good in which we shall take 
delight is greater than any sensible good, and comes more home to us, 
and is more continually delightful; all the more perfect again as the 
delight is more pure and free from all admixture of sadness or 
harassing solicitude; and of this it is said: <i>They shall be 
inebriated by the plenty of thy house, and thou wilt make them drink of 
the torrent of thy pleasure</i> (Ps. xxxv, 9).<p> 

7. There is also a natural desire common to all things, in that they 
all desire self-preservation, so far as possible; by the immoderation 
of which desire men are rendered timid and spare themselves too much 
from labours. This desire also shall be perfectly fulfilled when the 
Blessed attain to perfect everlasting duration, secure from all hurt, 
according to the text: <i>They shall not hunger nor thirst any more, 
neither shall the sun fall upon them, nor any heat</i> (Isa. xlix, 10; 
Apoc. vii, 16).<p> 

Thus it appears that by the vision of God subsistent intelligences gain 
true happiness, in which every desire is wholly laid to rest, and in 
which there is abundant sufficiency of all good things, which Aristotle 
considers a requisite of happiness.<A HREF="gc3_63d.htm">*</a> Nothing 
in this life is so like this final and perfect happiness as the life of 
them who contemplate truth so far as possible. For the contemplation of 
truth begins in this life, but will be consummated in the life to come, 
whereas the life of action and the political life do not transcend the 
bounds of this present.
