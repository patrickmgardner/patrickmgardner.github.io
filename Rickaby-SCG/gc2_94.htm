<H1>That an Intelligence subsisting apart and a Soul are not of one 
Species</h1>

A DIFFERENT type of being makes a different species. But the being of 
the human soul and of an intelligence subsisting apart is not of one 
type: the body can have no share in the being of a separately 
subsisting intelligence, as it can have in the being of the human soul, 
united with the body as form with matter.<p>

3. What makes a species by itself cannot be of the same species with 
that which does not make a species by itself, but is part of a species. 
Now a separately subsisting intelligence makes a species by itself, but 
a soul not, it is part of the human species.<p>

4. The species of a thing may be gathered from the activity proper to 
it: for activity shows power, and that is an indication of essence. 
Now the proper activity of a separately subsisting intelligence and of 
an intelligent soul is understanding. But the mode of understanding of 
a separately subsisting intelligence is quite different from that of 
the soul. The soul understands by taking from phantasms: not so the 
separately subsisting intelligence, that has no bodily organs in which 
phantasms should be.<A HREF="gc2_94a.htm">*</a>
