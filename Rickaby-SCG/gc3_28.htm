<H1>That Happiness does not consist in Honours nor in Human Glory</h1>

THE last end and happiness of man is his most perfect activity (Chap. 
<A HREF="gc3_26.htm">XXVI</a>). But the honour paid to a man does not 
consist in any act of his own, but in the act of another towards 
him.<A HREF="gc3_28a.htm">*</a><p> 

2. That is not the last end, which is good and desirable on account of 
something else. But such is honour: for a man is not rightly honoured 
except for some other good thing existing in him.<p> 

4. Even bad men may be honoured. It is better then to become worthy of 
honour than to be honoured. Therefore honour is not the highest good of 
man.<p> 

Hence it appears that neither does man's chief good consist in glory, 
or celebrity of fame. For glory, according to Cicero, is "a frequent 
mention of a man with praise"; or according to St Augustine, "brilliant 
notoriety with praise" (<i>clara notitia cum laude</i>). So then men 
wish for notoriety, attended with praise and a certain brilliance, that 
they may be honoured by those to whom they become known. Glory then is 
sought for the sake of honour. If then honour is not the highest good, 
much less is glory.
