<H1>That Things aim at Likeness to God in being Causes of other 
Things</h1>

A thing must be first perfect in itself before it can cause another 
thing.  The last perfection to supervene upon a thing is its 
becoming the cause of other things.  While then a creature tends by 
many ways to the likeness of God, the last way left open to it is to 
seek the divine likeness by being the cause of other things, 
according to what the Apostle says, <i>We are God's coadjutors</i> 
(1 Cor. iii, 9).<A HREF="gc3_21a.htm">*</a>
