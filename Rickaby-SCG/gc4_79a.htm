See the context, John v, 25-29, which quite
bears out St Thomas.<p>

The great proof of our corporeal resurrection is
the corporeal resurrection of Christ: <i>the first fruits,
Christ, then they that are Christ's at his coming</i>, 1 Cor.
xv, 23. If the Christ seen by His disciples after
His death was a mere wraith, or  ghost, then
there is no resurrection of the body awaiting us.
I take it some ghost stories are true statements of an
objective reality seen. But the appearance of the ghost
is not the removal of the body from the grave. The
corpse lies still where it was laid, even while the ghost
walks. Now, Holy Scripture assures us, this is precisely 
what did not happen in the case of Christ.
The body was not in the tomb (Matt. xxviii, 6:
Mark xvi, 6: Luke xxiv, 3: John xx, 2). St Peter
appeals publicly to the fact in Jerusalem a few weeks
after, and says that Christ's flesh did not see corruption
(Acts ii, 24-32). The Jews, <i>Annas the high priest and
Caiphas and John and Alexander, and all that were of
the high priest's kin</i> (Acts iv, 6), had every interest in
producing the body of the Man, whose resurrection
was proclaimed (Acts iv, 10), and whose blood was
being brought upon their heads (Acts v, 28). They
did not produce it, they were unable to trace it. All
that they could produce was the lame story of the
'sleeping witnesses' (Matt. xxviii, 11-15). The 'wraith
theory' is a direct contradiction of the <i>witness of the
Apostles</i> (Acts iv, 33). It transforms the <i>upper chamber</i>
(Acts i, 13), where the <i>spirit of truth</i> descended (John
xvi, 13: Acts ii, 4) into <i>a den of thieves</i> (Mark xi, 17)
A Christian at least will beware of such a theory.
