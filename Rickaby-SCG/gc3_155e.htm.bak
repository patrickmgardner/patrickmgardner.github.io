Even in the sinner the habits of faith and hope,
as also all actual graces, common to the just and the
unjust, may be put under <i>gratia gratum faciens</i>, 
inasmuch as they tend to the sanctification of the recipient
more directly than to the general edification of the
Church, which is the purpose of <i>gratia gratis data</i>.
Besides extraordinary miraculous gifts, there would
come under <i>gratia gratis data</i> the ordinary powers
that go with the Sacrament of Order.
