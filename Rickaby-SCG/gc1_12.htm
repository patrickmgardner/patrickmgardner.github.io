<H1>Of the Opinion of those who say that the Existence
of God is a Tenet of Faith alone and cannot he demonstrated</h1>

THE falseness of this opinion is shown to us as well by the art of 
demonstration, which teaches us to argue causes from effects, as also 
by the order of the sciences, for if there be no knowable substance 
above sensible substances, there will be no science above physical 
science; as also by the efforts of philosophers, directed to the proof 
of the existence of God; as also by apostolic truth asserting: <i>The 
invisible things of God are clearly seen, being understood by the 
things that are made</i> (Rom. i, 20).<A HREF="gc1_12a.htm">*</a> The 
axiom that in God essence and existence are the same is to be 
understood of the existence whereby God subsists in Himself, the manner 
of which is unknown to us, as also is His essence; not of the existence 
which signifies an affirmative judgement of the understanding. For in 
the form of such affirmative judgement the fact that <i>there is a 
God</i> falls under demonstration; as our mind is led by demonstrative 
reasons to form such a proposition declaratory of the existence of 
God.<A HREF="gc1_12b.htm">*</a> In the reasonings whereby the existence 
of God is demonstrated it is not necessary to assume for a premise the 
essence or <i>quiddity</i><A HREF="gc1_12c.htm">*</a> of God: but 
instead of the quiddity the effect is taken for a premise, as is done 
in demonstrations <i>a posteriori</i> from effect to cause. All the 
names of God are imposed either on the principle of denying of God 
Himself certain effects of His power, or from some habitude of God 
towards those effects.<A HREF="gc1_12d.htm">*</a> Although God 
transcends sense and the objects of sense, nevertheless sensible 
effects are the basis of our demonstration of the existence of God. 
Thus the origin of our own knowledge is in sense, even of things that 
transcend sense.
