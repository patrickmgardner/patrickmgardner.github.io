Manicheism, as represented by the Cathari and
Albigenses, was a strong power in St Thomas's time.
After a prevalence of more than a thousand years, it
is entirely dead in the West. As the plague takes the
place of other sicknesses, so Materialism has killed
Manicheism. In old times, Matter baffled Mind;
and Mind was tempted to pronounce Matter evil.
Now the empire of Mind over Matter is consolidated
and daily spreading; and Mind is apt to fall in love
with its creature, Matter, to identify itself with it,
and finally to worship it. There is a strand of
Manicheism in those two lost causes, Calvinism and
Puritanism.
