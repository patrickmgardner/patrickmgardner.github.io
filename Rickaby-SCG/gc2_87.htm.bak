<H1>That the Human Soul is brought into Being by a Creative Act of 
God</h1>

Everything that is brought into being is either generated or created. 
But the human soul is not generated, either by way of composition of 
parts or by the generation of the body (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_86.htm">LXXXVI</a>); and yet it comes new into existence, 
being neither eternal nor pre-existent (Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc2_83.htm">LXXXIII</a>, <A HREF="gc2_83.htm">LXXXIV</a>): therefore 
it comes into being by creation. Now, as has been shown above, God 
alone can create (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_21.htm">XXI</a>).<p> 

2. Whatever has existence as subsistent being, is also made in the way 
that a subsistent being is made: while whatever has no existence as a 
subsistent being, but is attached to something else, is not made 
separately, but only under condition of that having been made to which 
it is attached. But the soul has this peculiarity to distinguish it 
from other forms, that it is a subsistent being; and the existence 
which is proper to it communicates to the body. The soul then is made 
as a subsistent being is made: it is the subject of a making-process 
all its own, unlike other forms, which are made incidentally in the 
making of the compounds to which hey belong. But as the soul has no 
material part, it cannot be made out of any subject-matter: 
consequently it must be made out of nothing, and so created.<p> 

5. The end of a thing answers to its beginning. Now the end of the 
human soul and its final perfection is, by knowledge and love to 
transcend the whole order of created things, and attain to its first 
principle and beginning, which is God. Therefore from God it has 
properly its first origin.<p> 

Holy Scripture seems to insinuate this conclusion: for whereas, 
speaking of the origin of other animals, it scribes their souls to 
other causes, as when it says: <i>Let the waters produce the creeping 
thing of living soul</i> (Gen. i, 20): coming to man, it shows that his 
soul is created by God, saying: <i>God formed man from the slime of the 
earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life</i> (Gen. ii, 7).
