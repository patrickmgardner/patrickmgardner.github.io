<b>ou genomenon ex oudenos</b> (not made out of anything) is not 
equivalent to <b>genomenon ek tou m&ecirc;denos</b> (made out of nothing). The 
former notion would be applicable to a Creature created from eternity, 
if there were such: the latter would not. The former denies 
pre-existent material, the latter affirms a previous condition of 
nothingness. The former implies creation, the latter implies the lapse 
of a finite period since creation.
