This is a <i>static</i> view of a series of gradations, as it were, 
crystallised, showing no indication of that <i>virtual progress</i> 
from the highest of the lower genus to the lowest of the higher, which 
is the idea of evolution, true or false.  This static view, which is 
also that of Aristotle, has been termed "evolution in co-existence," 
not in succession.
