<H1>Points of Reply to Difficulties touching the Economy of the 
Incarnation</h1>

WE must bear in mind that, so immovable is the divine goodness in its 
perfection, that nothing is lost to God, however near any creature is 
raised to Him: the gain is to the creature.<p> 

3. Man being a compound of a spiritual and a corporeal nature, and 
thereby, we may say, occupying the borderland of two natures, all 
creation seems to be interested in whatever is done for man's 
salvation. Lower corporeal creatures make for his use, and are in some 
sort of subjection to him: while the higher spiritual creation, the 
angelic, has in common with man its attainment of the last end. This 
argues a certain appropriateness in the universal Cause of all 
creatures taking to Himself in unity of person that creature whereby He 
is more readily in touch with all the rest of creation.<p> 

4. Sin in man admits of expiation, because man's choice is not 
immovably fixed on its object, but may be perverted from good to evil, 
and from evil brought back to good; and the like is the case of man's 
reason, which, gathering the truth from sensible appearances and signs, 
can find its way to either side of a conclusion. But an angel has a 
fixed discernment of things through simple intuition; and as he is 
fixed in his apprehension, so is he fixed also in his choice. Hence he 
either does not take to evil at all; or if he does take to evil, he 
takes to it irrevocably, and his sin admits of no expiation. Since then 
the expiation of sin was the chief cause of the Incarnation, it was 
more fitting for human nature than for angelic nature to be assumed by 
God.<p> 

7. Though all created good is a small thing, compared with the divine 
goodness, still there can be nothing greater in creation than the 
salvation of the rational creature, which consists in the enjoyment of 
that divine goodness. And since the salvation of man has followed from 
the Incarnation of God, it cannot be said that that Incarnation has 
brought only slight profit to the world. Nor need all men be saved by 
the Incarnation, but they only who by faith and the sacraments of faith 
adhere to the Incarnation.<p> 

8. The Incarnation was manifested to man by sufficient evidences. There 
is no more fitting way of manifesting Godhead than by the performance 
of acts proper to God. Now it is proper to God to be able to change the 
course of nature (<i>naturae leges</i>), by doing something above that 
nature of which Himself is the author. Works overriding the ordinary 
course of nature (<i>opera quae supra leges naturae fiunt</i>) are the 
aptest evidences of divine being. Such works Christ did; and by these 
works He argued His Divinity. When asked, <i>Art thou he that is to 
come?</i> He replied, <i>The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are 
cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead rise again</i> (Luke vii, 22).<A 
HREF="gc4_55a.htm">*</a> And if it be said that the same miracles have 
been wrought by others, we must observe that Christ worked them in a 
very different and more divine way. Others are said to have wrought 
miracles by prayer, but Christ wrought them by command, as of His own 
power. And He not only wrought them Himself, but He gave to others the 
power of working the same and even greater miracles; and they worked 
them at the mere invocation of the name of Christ. And not only 
corporal miracles, but spiritual miracles, were wrought through Christ 
and at the invocation of His name: the Holy Ghost was given, hearts 
were set on fire with divine love, minds were suddenly instructed in 
the knowledge of divine things, and the tongues of the simple were 
rendered eloquent to propose the divine truth to men (Heb. ii, 3, 
4).<p> 

9. Human nature is so conditioned as not to be apt to be led to 
perfection at once; but it must be led by the hand through stages of 
imperfection, so to arrive at perfection at last, as we see in the 
training of children. If great and unheard-of truths were proposed to a 
multitude, they would not grasp them immediately: their only chance is 
to become accustomed to such truths by mastering lesser truths first. 
Thus it was fitting for the human race to receive their first 
instruction in the things of salvation by light and rudimentary lessons 
(<i>levia et minora documenta</i>), delivered by the patriarchs, the 
law and the prophets; and that finally in the consummation of ages the 
perfect doctrine of Christ should be set forth on earth. <i>When the 
fulness of time was come, God sent his Son</i> (Gal. iv, 4). <i>The law 
was our paedagogue unto Christ, but now we are no longer under a 
paedagogue</i> (Gal. iii, 24, 25).<A HREF="gc4_55b.htm">*</a><p> 

12. It was not expedient for the Incarnate God in this world to live 
in wealth and high honour: first, because the object of His coming was 
to withdraw the minds of men from their attachment to earthly things, 
and to raise them to things heavenly, for which purpose He found it 
necessary to draw men by His example to a contempt of riches: secondly, 
because if He had abounded in riches, and had been set in some high 
position, His divine doings would have been ascribed rather to secular 
power than to the virtue of the Divinity. This indeed forms the most 
efficacious argument of His Divinity, that without aid of secular power 
He has changed the whole world for the better.<A 
HREF="gc4_55c.htm">*</a><p> 

13. God's commandment to men is of works of virtue; and the more 
perfectly any one performs an act of virtue, the more he obeys God. Now 
of all virtues charity is the chief: all others are referred to it. 
Christ's obedience to God consisted most of all in His perfect 
fulfilment of the act of charity: <i>for greater charity than this no 
man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends</i> (John xv, 
13).<p> 

15. Though God has no wish for the death of men, yet He has a wish for 
virtue; and by virtue man meets death bravely, and exposes himself to 
danger of death for charity. Thus God had a wish for the death of 
Christ, inasmuch as Christ took upon Himself that death out of 
charity, and bravely endured it. 

17. It is well said that Christ wished to suffer the death of the 
cross in order to give an example of humility. The virtue of humility 
consists in keeping oneself within one's own bounds, not reaching out 
to things above one, but submitting to one's superior. Thus humility 
cannot befit God, who has no superior, but is above all. Whenever any 
one subjects himself out of humility to an equal or any inferior, that 
is because he takes that equal or inferior to be his superior in some 
respect. Though then the virtue of humility cannot attach to Christ in 
His divine nature, yet it may attach to Him in his human nature. And 
His divinity renders His humility all the more praiseworthy: for the 
dignity of the person adds to the merit of humility; and there can be 
no greater dignity to a man than his being God. Hence the highest 
praise attaches to the humility of the Man God, who, to wean men's 
hearts from worldly glory to the love of divine glory, chose to endure 
a death of no ordinary sort, but a death of the deepest ignominy.<p> 

19. <i>It was necessary for Christ to suffer</i> (Luke xxiv, 46), not 
only to afford an example of braving death for the love of truth, but 
also for the expiation of the sins of other men; which expiation He 
made by His own sinless Self choosing to suffer the death due to sin, 
and so satisfying for others by taking on Himself the penalty due to 
others. And though the sole grace of God is sufficient for the 
forgiveness of sins, nevertheless in the process of that forgiveness 
something is required on his part to whom the sin is forgiven, namely, 
to offer satisfaction to him whom he has offended.<A 
HREF="gc4_55d.htm">*</a> And because men could not do this for 
themselves, Christ did it for all, suffering a voluntary death for 
charity.<p> 

20. Although when it is a question of punishing sins, he must be punished
who has sinned, nevertheless, when it is a question of making satisfaction,
one may bear another's penalty. When punishment is inflicted for sin, his
iniquity is put into the scale who has sinned: but when satisfaction is made
by the offender's voluntary taking upon himself a penalty to appease him
whom he has offended, account is taken in that case of the affection and good
will of him who makes the satisfaction. And this appears best in the case of
one taking upon himself a penalty instead of another, and God accepting the
satisfaction of one for another (B. III, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_159.htm">CLIX</a> <i>ad fin.</i>)<A HREF="gc4_55e.htm">*</a><p>

25. Though the death of Christ is sufficient satisfaction for original 
sin, there is nothing incongruous in the miseries consequent<A 
HREF="gc4_55f.htm">*</a> upon original sin remaining in all men, even 
in those who are made partakers of the redemption of Christ. It was a 
fit and advantageous arrangement for the punishment<A 
HREF="gc4_55g.htm">*</a> to remain after the guilt was taken away: --
first, for the conformity of the faithful with Christ, as of members 
with their head, that as Christ endured many sufferings, so His 
faithful should be subject to sufferings, and so arrive at immortality, 
as the Apostle says: <i>If we suffer with him, so that we be glorified 
with him</i> (Rom. viii, 17): -- secondly, because if men coming to 
Christ gained immediate exemption from death and suffering, many men 
would come rather for these corporal benefits than for spiritual goods, 
contrary to the intention of Christ, who came into the world to draw 
men from the love of corporal things to spiritual things: -- thirdly, 
because this sudden impassibility and immortality would in a manner 
compel men to receive the faith of Christ, and so the merit of faith 
would be lost.<p> 

26. Each individual must seek the remedies that make for his own 
salvation. The death of Christ is a universal cause of salvation, as 
the sin of the first man was a universal cause of damnation.<A 
HREF="gc4_55h.htm">*</a> But there is need of a special application to 
each individual for the individual to share in the effect of a 
universal cause.<A HREF="gc4_55i.htm">*</a> The effect of the sin of 
our first parent reaches each individual through his carnal origin. 
The effect of the death of Christ reaches each individual by his 
spiritual regeneration, whereby he is conjoined and in a manner 
incorporated with Christ.
