<H1>That Man cannot Merit beforehand the said Assistance</h1>

EVERYTHING stands as matter<A HREF="gc3_150a.htm>*</a> to that which is 
above itself. Now matter does not move itself to its own perfection, 
but must be moved by another. Man then does not move himself to the 
gaining of the divine assistance, which is above him, but rather he is 
moved by God to the gaining of it. But the motion of the mover precedes 
the motion of the thing moved, alike in the order of thought and in the 
order of causation. The divine assistance therefore is not given to us 
because we are advanced to receive it by our good works; but rather we 
are proficient in good works because we are forestalled by the divine 
assistance.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Not by the works of justice that we have done, but 
according to his own mercy he hath saved us</i> (Tit. iii, 5): It is 
not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that 
showeth mercy</i> (Rom. ix, 16): because man needs must be forestalled 
by the divine assistance for purposes both of willing well and doing 
well. As the victory is attributed to the general, which is won by the 
labour of the soldiers, so such expressions as the above are not to be 
taken as exclusive of the free choice of the will, according to the 
misconstruction which some have put upon them, as though man were not 
master of his own acts, interior and exterior, but they show that man 
is under God. Again it is said: <i>Turn us, O Lord, to thee, and we 
shall be turned</i> (Lament. v, 21): which shows that our turning, or 
conversion, is anticipated by the aid of God converting us. Still we 
read, as spoken in the person of God: <i>Turn ye to me, and I will turn 
to you</i> (Zach. i, 3); not that the work of God in us does not go 
before our conversion; but the meaning is that the conversion, whereby 
we turn to God, is aided also by His subsequent aid, strengthening it 
to arrive to effect, and securing it that it may reach its due term.<p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of the Pelagians, who said that the divine 
assistance is given us in consideration of our deservings; and that, 
while the beginning of our justification is of ourselves, the 
consummation of it is of God.
