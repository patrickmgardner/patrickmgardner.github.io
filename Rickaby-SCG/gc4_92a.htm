"There might be probation after probation
even in the world to come. But some human souls
would continue obstinately and unrepentingly set in
wickedness, age after age, and probation after probation: 
for the possible malice of the will is vastly great.
What is to become of such obstinate charaders? It
seems against the idea of probation, that periods of
trial should succeed one another in an endless series.
. . . . The series of probations must end somewhere.
And then?" (<i>Ethics and Natural Law</i>, p. 166.) "All
this speculation, be it understood, lies apart from 
revelation" (ib. p. 165). St Thomas however presently 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc4_95.htm">XCV</a>) argues the notion of any 
probation at all in the next world to be an <i>a priori</i>
impossibility.
