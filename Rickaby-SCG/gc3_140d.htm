So Aristotle, <i>Topica</i>, III, 5 cf. <i>Metaph.</i> IX, vii, 7.
St Thomas and Aristotle are fond of this 
illustration, that  white is <i>disgregativum visus</i>, <b>diakritikon
opse&ocirc;s</b>
and black <i>congregativum</i>, <b>sugkritikon</b>; but never
explain it. It means that white, as representing light,
is <i>distinctive of vision</i>, i.e., causes  distinct vision; and
black, as representing darkness, is <i>confusive of vision</i>.
So, if all things were black -- the sun included, -- we
should see nothing.
