<H1>That the Truth of reason is not contrary to the Truth of Christian 
Faith</h1>

THE natural dictates of reason must certainly be quite true: it is 
impossible to think of their being otherwise.  Nor a gain is it 
permissible to believe that the tenets of faith are false, being so 
evidently confirmed by God.<A HREF="gc1_7a.htm">*</a> Since therefore 
falsehood alone is contrary to truth, it is impossible for the truth of 
faith to be contrary to principles known by natural reason.<P>

2. Whatever is put into the disciple's mind by the teacher is contained 
in the knowledge of the teacher, unless the teacher is teaching 
dishonestly, which would be a wicked thing to say of God. But the 
knowledge of principles naturally known is put into us by God, seeing 
that God Himself is the author of our nature. Therefore these 
principles also are contained in the Divine Wisdom.  Whatever therefore 
is contrary to these principles is contrary to Divine Wisdom, and 
cannot be of God.<P>

3. Contrary reasons fetter our intellect fast, so that it cannot 
proceed to the knowledge of the truth.  If therefore contrary 
informations were sent us by God, our intellect would be thereby 
hindered from knowledge of the truth: but such hindrance cannot be of 
God.<P> 

4. What is natural cannot be changed while nature remains.<A 
HREF="gc1_7b.htm">*</a>  But contrary opinions cannot be in the same 
mind at the same time: therefore no opinion or belief is sent to man 
from God contrary to natural knowledge. And therefore the Apostle says: 
<i>The word is near in thy heart and in thy mouth, that is, the word of 
faith which we preach</i> (Rom. x, 8).  But because it surpasses reason 
it is counted by some as contrary to reason, which cannot be. To the 
same effect is the authority of Augustine (Gen. ad litt. ii, 18) : " 
What truth reveals can nowise be contrary to the holy books either of 
the Old or of the New Testament."  Hence the conclusion is evident, 
that any arguments alleged against the teachings of faith do not 
proceed logically from first principles of nature, principles of 
themselves known, and so do not amount to a demonstration; but are 
either probable reasons or sophistical; hence room is left for refuting 
them.<A HREF="gc1_7c.htm">*</a>
