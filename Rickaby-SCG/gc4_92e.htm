<i>Per se nota</i>. As St Thomas observes (ia 2ae,
q. 94, art. 2), there are propositions absolutely 
self-evident to any man who is not an idiot; and 
propositions relatively self-evident to the expert, who
has kept up with the progress of a particular science,
while to the layman, or the unprogressive student,
they are not evident at all. At the same time, novelty
is not always progress.
