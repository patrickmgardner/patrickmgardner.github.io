St Thomas does not view causation <i>dynamically</i>, but 
<i>statically</i>. I mean, a cause to him is not a being which by its 
changing propagates a change to some other being, -- as when one 
ninepin falling knocks over another ninepin, and so on to the end of 
the row: this he calls, not <i>causatio</i>, but <i>motio</i>, and such 
are the causes of causation usually considered by physicists,  but 
causation in St Thomas points to dependence of being, and a cause is a 
being on which another being, its effect, is more or less permanently 
dependent for its existence: that is why he makes quite as much of 
<i>material</i> and <i>formal</i> and <i>final</i> as of 
<i>efficient</i> causation.
