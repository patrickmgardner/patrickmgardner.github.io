<H1>That Man needs the Assistance of Divine Grace to persevere in 
Good<A HREF="gc3_156a.htm">*</a></h1>

THE power of free will regards matters of election: but a matter of 
election is some particular thing to be done; and a particular thing to 
be done is what is here and now:<A HREF="gc3_156b.htm">*</a> but 
perseverance is not a matter of present and immediate conduct, but a 
continuance of activity for all time: perseverance therefore is an 
effect above the power of free will, and therefore needing the 
assistance of divine grace.<p> 

3. Though man is master of his act, he is not master of his natural 
powers; and therefore, though he is free to will or not will a thing, 
still his willing cannot make his will in the act of willing adhere 
immovably to the thing willed or chosen. But the immovable adherence of 
the will to good is requisite for perseverance: perseverance therefore 
is not in the power of free will.<A HREF="gc3_156c.htm">*</a><p> 

Hence it is said: <i>He who hath begun a good work in you will perfect 
it unto the day of Christ Jesus</i> (Philip. i, 6): <i>The God of all 
grace, who hath called us to his eternal glory in Christ Jesus, himself 
will perfect us through some little suffering, confirm and establish 
us</i> (1 Pet. v, 10). There are also found in Holy Scripture many 
prayers for perseverance: e.g., <i>Perfect my steps in thy ways, that 
my footsteps may not slip</i> (Ps. xvi, 5); and especially that 
petition of the Lord's Prayer, <i>Thy kingdom come</i>: for the kingdom 
will not come for us unless we persevere in good.<p> 

Hereby is refuted the error of the Pelagians, who said that free will 
is sufficient for man for his perseverance in good, and that there is 
no need of the assistance of grace for the purpose.<p> 

As free will is not sufficient for perseverance in good without the 
help of God given from without, so neither is any infused habit. For in 
the state of our present life the habits infused into us of God do not 
totally take away from our free will its fickleness and liability to 
evil, although they do to some extent establish the free will in good. 
And therefore, when we say that man needs the aid of grace for final 
perseverance, we do not mean that, over and above the habitual grace 
first infused into him for the doing of good acts, there is infused 
into him another habitual grace enabling him to persevere; but we mean 
that, when he has got all the gratuitous habits that he ever is to 
have, man still needs some aid of divine providence governing him from 
without.
