<H1>That God in willing Himself wills also other things besides 
Himself<a href="gc1_75a.htm">*</a></h1>

EVERY one desires the perfection of that which for its own sake he 
wills and loves: for the things which we love for their own sakes we 
wish to be excellent, and ever better and better, and to be multiplied 
as much as possible. But God wills and loves His essence for its own 
sake. Now that essence is not augmentable and multipliable in itself 
(Chap.  <a href="gc1_42.htm">XLII</a>), but can be multiplied only in 
its likeness, which is shared by many. God therefore wills the 
multitude of things, inasmuch as He wills and loves His own 
perfection.<p> 

3. Whoever loves anything in itself and for itself, wills consequently 
all things in which that thing is found: as he who loves sweetness in 
itself must love all sweet things.  But God wills and loves His own 
being in itself and for itself; and all other being is a sort of 
participation by likeness of His being.<p> 

6. The will follows the understanding.  But God with His understanding 
understands Himself in the first place, and in Himself understands all 
other things: therefore in like manner He wills Himself in the first 
place, and in willing Himself wills all other things.<p> 

This is confirmed by the authority of Holy Scripture: <i>Thou lovest 
all things that are, and hatest nothing of the things that thou hast 
made</i> (Wisd. xi, 2)
