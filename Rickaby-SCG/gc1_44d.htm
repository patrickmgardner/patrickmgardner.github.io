The 'forms' here spoken of (not the human
soul) are entities denoted by abstract names, as beauty,
dexterity, squareness. They exist only in particular
substances, and in each case imperfectly according to
the imperfections of that in which they exist.  Thus
beauty is marred by the age, bodily infirmities and
accidents, of any beautiful living being. No living
being on earth is ideally beautiful. Is then every
ideal 'form' something that practically cannot be?
St Thomas thinks not. Recognising that the ideal
cannot be except in a mind, he thereupon posits
ideals which are themselves minds -- self-conscious
ideals, and these are the angels. The Platonic ideas,
or ideals, are thus brought into <i>rerum natura</i> as
angels, one angel being the self-conscious ideal of
one quality, as, perhaps, of <i>swiftness</i>, another of
another, as, perhaps, of <i>accuracy</i>. Thus he says in
II, 93: "Separate substances (i.e., angels) are certain 
essences existing by themselves (<i>quidditates subsistentes</i>)." 
This essence, existing by itself, and conscious of itself
-- existing therefore in a mind, its own
mind, as all ideal being needs to exist in a mind
-- this ideal essence, I say, is not limited, as forms are
limited in the material universe, by being reduced to
the particular. An angel, says St Thomas (<i>Contra
Gent.</i>, 11, 93), is not reduced to the particular as
one individual of many in a species: each angel is a
species by himself, a living, conscious specific essence,
sole of its kind. Thus among angels there are particular 
species, but not particular individuals of a
species: this or that species is this or that individual,
containing an ample measure, though not a divine
fulness, of the specific essence. St Thomas does not
say that specific forms necessarily exist by themselves:
he does not teach the necessary existence of angels:
all he argues is that, if these forms exist by themselves 
at all (<i>si sint subsistentes</i>), they must be self-conscious 
and intelligent beings. The utmost that he
can be said to contend for is that angels are a fitting
complement of the universe (II, 91).  All that is
absolutely necessary is the existence of a Supreme
Being, who virtually contains in Himself all perfections 
which are represented in our minds by various
abstract forms; a Being who is the Actuality of all
ideal perfection (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>).<P>

The argument then in the text is: 'Imperfect
forms are apparent everywhere in the material creation.  
Imperfect forms must come of perfect forms;
perfect forms are ideal forms: ideal forms can exist
nowhere but in the mind: if these ideal forms exist
anywhere by themselves, they must themselves be
minds conscious of what they are: such self-conscious
ideals are the angels: anyhow, whether existing by
themselves or not, ideals must be represented in one
Perfect Mind: God therefore is Mind.' The argument is 
Platonic; or rather, Neoplatonist, as the
making of the ideals into angels shows.  It is rather a
probable intuition than an argument.  As an argument, 
it has many difficulties. St Thomas cannot
have meant to say that any angel was living perfect
beauty, or living perfect wisdom, for then it would
be God: but perhaps we might have a living perfect
fragrance, or a living perfect agility; and we may
suppose that only these minor perfections, which do
not carry all other perfections with them, are personified 
in the angels, and that only in an imperfect way.<P>

Omitting the theory of angels, which will recur
again (Book II, Chap. LV, XCVIII, with notes) we
may formulate the matter finally thus: The ideal
must be realised somewhere.  It is realisable only in
mind.  Now whatever we may think of angels, and
their intermediate realisation of ideals, we must 
arrive ultimately at one mind that realises the whole
ideal order. That one grand realiser and realisation
of all ideals is the Mind of God.<P>
