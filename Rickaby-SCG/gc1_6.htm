<H1>That there is no lightmindedness in assenting to
Truths of Faith, although they are above Reason</h1>

THE Divine Wisdom, that knows all things most fully, has deigned to 
reveal these her secrets to men, and in proof of them has displayed 
works beyond the competence of all natural powers, in the wonderful 
cure of diseases, in the raising of the dead, and what is more 
wonderful still, in such inspiration of human minds as that simple and 
ignorant persons, filled with the gift of the Holy Ghost, have gained 
in an instant the height of wisdom and eloquence.<A 
HREF="gc1_6a.htm">*</a> By force of the aforesaid proof, without 
violence of arms, without promise of pleasures, and, most wonderful 
thing of all, in the midst of the violence of persecutors, a countless 
multitude, not only of the uneducated but of the wisest men, flocked to 
the Christian faith, wherein doctrines are preached that transcend all 
human understanding, pleasures of sense are restrained, and a contempt 
is taught of all worldly possessions. That mortal minds should assent 
to such teaching is the greatest of miracles, and a manifest work of 
divine inspiration leading men to despise the visible and desire only 
invisible goods. Nor did this happen suddenly nor by chance, but by a 
divine disposition, as is manifest from the fact that God foretold by 
many oracles of His prophets that He intended to do this. The books of 
those prophets are still venerated amongst us, as bearing testimony to 
our faith. This argument is touched upon in the text: <i>Which</i> 
(salvation) <i>having begun to be uttered by the Lord, was confirmed by 
them that heard him even unto us, God joining in the testimony by signs 
and portents and various distributions of the Holy Spirit</i> (Heb. ii, 
3, 4).  This so wonderful conversion of the world to the Christian 
faith is so certain a sign of past miracles, that they need no further 
reiteration, since they appear evidently in their effects. It would be 
more wonderful than all other miracles, if without miraculous signs the 
world had been induced by simple and low-born men to believe truths so 
arduous, to do works so difficult, to hope for reward so high. And yet 
even in our times God ceases not through His saints to work miracles 
for the confirmation of the faith.<A HREF="gc1_6b.htm">*</a>
