God would do certain things, apart from penance or prayer, which He 
foresees will be interposed, as the destruction of Ninive (Jon. iii, 
10), or of the Israelites in the desert (Exod. xxxii, 10). He does not 
will such things absolutely; and St Thomas here speaks of absolute 
will, e.g., of God's promises to Messiah and His Church, temporary 
appearences notwithstanding (Ps. lxxxviii, 33-38).
