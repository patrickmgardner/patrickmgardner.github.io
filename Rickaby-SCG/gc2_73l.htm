The tentative conclusions of the <i>Meno</i>, 85-86, and the poetry of the 
<i>Phaedrus</i>, passed into aphorisms among the later Platonists. See Jowett's 
<i>Dialogues of Plato</i>, II, pp. 13-19, ed. 3. Later Platonists, we 
may say, were more Platonic than Plato. But it remains a leading line 
of difference between Plato and Aristotle, that Plato never gave due 
recognition, as Aristotle did, to the value of sense experience in the 
genesis of science and philosophy. St Thomas's argument here is this, 
that if the human mind is eternal and one, then human knowledge is 
eternal and one: whence it follows that, when the individual seems to 
be learning by the experience of his senses, he is really only 
recognising what is in his mind already.
