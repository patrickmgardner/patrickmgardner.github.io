<H1>That the Divine Assistance does not compel a Man to Virtue</h1>

DIVINE providence provides for all things according to their mode of 
existence (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_73.htm">LXXIII</a>, n. 2). But it is 
proper to man and to every rational creature to act voluntarily and to 
be master of his own acts; and compulsion is contrary to 
voluntariness.<p> 

3. It is by will that man is directed to a final end: for the good and 
the final end is the object of will. And the divine assistance is 
vouchsafed us for this special purpose, that we may attain to our final 
end. That aid therefore does not exclude the act of our will: on the 
contrary, it is precisely the act of our will that the divine 
assistance produces in us: hence the Apostle says: <i>It is God who 
worketh in us both to will and to act according to the good will</i> 
(Phil. ii, 13). But compulsion defeats in us the act of the will: for 
we do that under compulsion of which we will the contrary.<p> 

4. Man arrives at his last end by acts of virtue. But acts done under 
compulsion are not acts of virtue, for in virtue the chief thing is 
choice.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Consider that to-day the Lord hath put forth in 
thy sight life and good, and on the other hand death and evil, that thou 
mayest love the Lord thy God and walk in his ways. But f thy heart is 
turned away, and thou wilt not hear, etc.</i> (Deut. xxx, 15-18): 
<i>Before 
man is life and death, good and evil: what pleases him shall be given to 
him</i> (Ecclus xv, 18).
