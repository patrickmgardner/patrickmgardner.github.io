<H1>Of the reason for which Simple Fornication is a Sin by Divine Law, 
and of the Natural Institution of Marriage</h1>

HENCE appears the folly of those who say that simple fornication is not 
a sin.<A HREF="gc3_122a.htm">*</a> For they say: Given a woman free 
from a husband, and under no control of father or any other person, if 
any one approaches her with her consent, he does her no wrong, because 
she is pleased so to act, and has the disposal of her own person: nor 
does he do any wrong to another, for she is under no one's control: 
therefore there appears no sin. Nor does it seem to be a sufficient 
answer to say that she wrongs God, for God is not offended by us except 
by what we do against our own good (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_121.htm">CXXI</a>):<A HREF="gc3_122b.htm">*</a> but it does 
not appear that this conduct is against man's good: hence no wrong 
seems to be done to God thereby. In like manner also it does not appear 
a sufficient answer, that wrong is thereby done to one's neighbour, who 
is scandalised: for sometimes a neighbour is scandalised by what of 
itself is not a sin, in which case the sin is only incidental: but the 
question is not whether fornication is a sin incidentally, but whether 
it is a sin ordinarily and in itself.<p> 

We must seek a solution from what has been said before: for it has been 
said (Chapp. <A HREF="gc3_16.htm">XVI</a>, <A 
HREF="gc3_64.htm">LXIV</a>) that God has care of everything according 
to that which is good for it. Now it is good for everything to gain its 
end, and evil for it to be diverted from its due end. But as in the 
whole so also in the parts, our study should be that every part of man 
and every act of his may attain its due end. Now though the 
<i>semen</i> is superfluous for the preservation of the individual, yet 
it is necessary to him for the propagation of the species: while other 
excretions, such as excrement, urine, sweat, and the like, are needful 
for no further purpose: hence the only good that comes to man of them 
is by their removal from the body. But that is not the object in the 
emission of the <i>semen</i>, but rather the profit of generation, to 
which the union of the sexes is directed. But in vain would be the 
generation of man unless due nurture followed, without which the 
offspring generated could not endure. The emission of the <i>semen</i> 
then ought to be so directed as that both the proper generation may 
ensue and the education of the offspring be secured.<p> 

Hence it is clear that every emission of the <i>semen</i> is contrary 
to the good of man, which takes place in a way whereby generation is 
impossible; and if this is done on purpose, it must be a sin. I mean a 
way in which generation is impossible in itself as is the case in every 
emission of the <i>semen</i> without the natural union of male and 
female: wherefore such sins are called 'sins against nature.' But if it 
is by accident that generation cannot follow from the emission of the 
<i>semen</i>, the act is not against nature on that account, nor is it 
sinful; the case of the woman being barren would be a case in point.<p> 

Likewise it must be against the good of man for the <i>semen</i> to be 
emitted under conditions which, allowing generation to ensue, 
nevertheless bar the due education of the offspring. We observe that in 
those animals, dogs for instance, in which the female by herself 
suffices for the rearing of the offspring, the male and female stay 
no time together after the performance of the sexual act. But with all 
animals in which the female by herself does not suffice for the rearing 
of the offspring, male and female dwell together after the sexual act 
so long as is necessary for the rearing and training of the offspring. 
This appears in birds, whose young are incapable of finding their own 
food immediately they are hatched: for since the bird does not suckle 
her young with milk, according to the provision made by nature in 
quadrupeds, but has to seek food abroad for her young, and therefore 
keep them warm in the period of feeding, the female could not do this 
duty all alone by herself: hence divine providence has put in the male 
a natural instinct or standing by the female for the rearing of the 
brood. Now in the human species the female is clearly insufficient of 
herself for the rearing of the offspring, since the need of human life 
makes many demands, which cannot be met by one parent alone. Hence the 
fitness of human life requires man to stand by woman after the sexual 
act is done, and not to go off at once and form connexions with any one 
he meets, as is the way with fornicators. Nor is this reasoning 
traversed by the fact of some particular woman having wealth and power 
enough to nourish her offspring all by herself: for in human acts the 
line of natural rectitude is not drawn to suit the accidental variety 
of the individual, but the properties common to the whole species.<A 
HREF="gc3_122c.htm">*</a><p> 

A further consideration is, that in the human species the young need 
not only bodily nutrition, as animals do, but also the training of the 
soul. Other animals have their natural instincts (<i>suas 
prudentias</i>) to provide for themselves: but man lives by reason, 
which [read <i>quam</i>] takes the experience of a long time to arrive 
at discretion. Hence children need instruction by the confirmed 
experience of their parents: nor are they capable of such instruction 
as soon as they are born, but after a long time, the time in fact taken 
to arrive at the years of discretion. For this instruction again a long 
time is needed; and then moreover, because of the assaults of passion, 
whereby the judgement of prudence is thwarted, there is need not of 
instruction only, but also of repression. For this purpose the woman by 
herself is not competent, but at this point especially there is 
requisite the concurrence of the man, in whom there is at once reason 
more perfect to instruct, and force more potent to chastise. Therefore 
in the human race the advancement of the young in good must last, not 
for a short time, as in birds, but for a long period of life. Hence, 
whereas it is necessary in all animals for the male to stand by the 
female for such time as the father's concurrence is requisite for 
bringing up of the progeny, it is natural for man to be tied to the 
society of one fixed woman for a long period, not a short one. This 
social tie we call marriage. Marriage then is natural to man, and an 
irregular connexion outside of marriage is contrary to the good of man; 
and therefore fornication must be sinful.<p> 

Nor yet should it be counted a slight sin for one to procure the 
emission of the <i>semen</i> irrespective of the due purpose of 
generation and rearing of issue, on the pretence that it is a slight 
sin, or no sin at all, to apply any part of one's body to another use 
than that to which it is naturally ordained, as if, for example, one 
were to walk on his hands, or do with his feet something that ought to 
be done with his hands. The answer is that by such inordinate 
applications as those mentioned the good of man is not greatly injured: 
but the inordinate emission of the <i>semen</i> is repugnant to the 
good of nature, which is the conservation of the species.<A 
HREF="gc3_122d.htm">*</a> Hence, after the sin of murder, whereby a 
human nature already in actual existence is destroyed, this sort of sin 
seem to hold the second place, whereby the generation of human nature 
is precluded.<p> 

The above assertions are confirmed by divine authority. The 
unlawfulness of any emission of <i>semen</i>, upon which offspring 
cannot be consequent, is evident from such texts as these: <i>Thou 
shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind: Thou shalt not lie with 
any beast</i> (Levit. xviii, 22, 23): <i>Nor the effeminate, nor 
sodomites, shall possess the kingdom of God</i> (1 Cor. vi, 10). The 
unlawfulness of fornication and of all connexion with any other woman 
than one's own wife is clear from Deut. xxiii, 17: <i>There shall be no 
whore among the daughters of Israel, nor whoremonger among the sons of 
Israel: Keep thyself from all fornication, and beyond thine own wife 
suffer not the charge of knowing another</i> (Job. iv, 13): <i>Fly 
fornication</i> (1 Cor. vi, 18).<p> 

Hereby is refuted the error of those who say that there is no more sin 
in the emission of the <i>semen</i> than in the ejection of other 
superfluous products from the body.
