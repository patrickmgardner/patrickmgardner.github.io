<h1>An Answer to Difficulties raised in respect of Place</h1> 

IN this Sacrament something is present by force of conversion, and 
something by natural concomitance. By force of conversion there is 
present that which is the immediate term into which conversion is made. 
Such under the species of bread is the Body of Christ, into which the 
substance of bread is converted by the words, <i>This is my body</i>. 
Such again under the species of wine is the Blood of Christ, when it is 
said, <i>This is the chalice of my blood</i>. By natural concomitance 
all other things are there, which, though conversion is not made into 
them, nevertheless are really united with the term into which 
conversion is made. Clearly, the term into which conversion of the 
bread is made is not the Divinity of Christ, nor His Soul: nevertheless 
the Soul and the Divinity of Christ are under the species of bread, 
because of the real union of them both with the Body of Christ. If 
during the three days that Christ lay dead this Sacrament had been 
celebrated, the Soul of Christ would not have been under the species of 
bread, because it was not really united with His Body: nor would His 
Blood have been under the species of bread, nor His Body under the 
species of wine, because of the separation of the two in death. But 
now, because the Body of Christ in its nature is not without His Blood, 
the Body and Blood are contained under both species; the Body under the 
species of bread by force of conversion, and the Blood by natural 
concomitance; and conversely under the species of wine.<p> 

Hereby we have an answer to the difficulty of the incommensurateness of 
the Body of Christ with the space taken up by the bread. The substance 
of the bread is converted directly into the substance of the Body of 
Christ: but the dimensions of the Body of Christ are in the Sacrament 
by natural concomitance, not by force of conversion, since the 
dimensions of the bread remain.<A HREF="gc4_64a.htm">*</a> Thus then 
the Body of Christ is not referred to this particular place by means of 
its own dimensions, as though commensurate room had to be found for 
them, but by means of the dimensions of the bread, which remain, and 
for which commensurate room is found.<p> 

And so of the plurality of places. By its own proper dimensions the 
Body of Christ is in one place only; but by means of the dimensions of 
the bread that passes into it, the Body of Christ is in as many places 
as there are places in which the mystery of this conversion is 
celebrated, -- not divided into parts, but whole in each: for every 
consecrated bread is converted into the whole Body of Christ.
