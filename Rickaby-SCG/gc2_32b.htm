The objection may take this form: God must act at once in the 
production of the universe; because, with blank nothingness before Him, 
and infinite power at His control, He has nothing whatever to wait for, 
no conceivable motive for delay. -- But neither has He any constraining 
motive for action outside Himself; and therefore, if He acts outside 
Himself, He acts as and when He pleases: there is nothing to force His 
hand or anticipate His hour.
