Hence the doctrine of the Thomist school, that the will is 
determined by the last practical judgement made before action is taken. 
It seems to place freedom in the intellect rather than in the will. It 
is bound up with a further doctrine, that command (<i>imperium</i>) is 
a function of understanding, not of will. These are grave questions, 
which I had rather not handle. Enough for me to have translated this 
important passage fully and literally, and to have called attention to 
its significance.
