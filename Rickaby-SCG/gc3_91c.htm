Is this true? Is there any intelligence, or group
of intelligences, intermediate between men and God,
such that man's understanding, insufficient in itself, is
dependent on this intermediary for all that it knows?
If so, the 'separate intellect' of Averroes and Avicenna, --
higher than human, yet short of divine, at least 
according to Averroes, -- is not 'the baseless fabric of a
vision' after all, but the blurred and ill-apprehended
outline of a profound truth (B. II, Chapp. 
<A HREF="gc2_59.htm">LIX</a> sq.).
This would be a discovery indeed in psychology, if
it could be established. It might empty all the <i>virus</i>
of pantheism out of the doctrine of the Absolute,
showing that the Absolute, while real, is not God.
It might assign their true places in creation to the
Arian Logos, to the Gnostic Aeons, as also to the
Platonic Ideas. -- Modern Psychology meanwhile is
serenely oblivious of angels. Catholics still believe in
them, dread the evil ones (devils), and pray to the
good ones, who now see the face of God. Catholics
believe that good angels are often the vehicles through
which 'actual graces,' that is, warnings and impulses
in order to salvation, descend from God to men. But
that man owes his ordinary knowledge of mathematics,
chemistry, sanitation, railway management, or even of
religion, to any action whatsoever of angelic 
intelligence upon his mind, -- I do not know any man 
living who thinks so. For all that I can tell, I should
know all that I do know, just as I know it now, if
if there were no angels at all. The psychological 
discovery of which I have spoken, remains to be made,
for he discovers who proves. Yet St Thomas seems to
have accepted it.
