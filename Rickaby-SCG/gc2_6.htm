<H1>That it belongs to God to be to other Beings the Principle of 
Existence</h1> 

In inferior agents it is a sign of attained perfection, when they can 
produce their own likeness. But God is sovereignly perfect (B.I. Chap. 
<A HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>). Therefore it belongs to Him to make 
some being like Himself in actual existence.<p> 

6. The more perfect any principle of activity is, the wider its sphere 
of action. But that pure actuality, which is God, is more perfect than 
actuality mingled with potentiality, such as is in us. Now actuality is 
the principle of action. Since then by the actuality which is in us, we 
are not only capable of immanent acts, such as understanding and 
willing, but also of acts tending to exterior things and productive of 
effects, much more can God, by virtue of His actuality, not only 
understand and will, but also produce an effect.<i>Who maketh great and 
wonderful and inscrutable works without number</i> (Job v.9).
