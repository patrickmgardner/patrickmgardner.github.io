"The understanding can understand many things
together, taking them as one, but not many things 
together, taking them as many. By 'taking them as one
or many' I mean, by one or by several intellectual
presentations. . . . . Whatsoever things therefore the
mind can understand by one presentation, it can 
understand together. Hence God sees all things by one
thing, which is His essence." -- St Thomas, <i>Sum.Theol</i>.
I, q. 85, art. 4.
