In reading this chapter, which I have not translated 
in full, one feels like an observer at work with
a telescope out of focus. The thought of the Angelic
Doctor is blurred by that fatal misconception which
it was reserved for Newton to dissipate, that, in the
heavens above, physical nature works necessarily and
uniformly, but, on the earth beneath, contingently
(so that the effect might be otherwise) and with
some anomaly and irregularity. We must say boldly
that the case is not so; that throughout all time
and all space physical nature works necessarily and
uniformly. The difference between astronomy and
such sciences as chemistry and biology comes merely
to this, that the elementary phenomena of astronomy,
the orbits of the planets, and the rotation of the
earth, depend, at first approximation, upon an 
extremely simple combination of causes, and therefore 
are readily calculable: whereas in the rest of nature 
complexity of causes and intermingling of effects
is enormous, and our reckonings are continually
thrown out by our ignorance of coexistences. The
heavens are seen from a distance, and to the naked
eye are visible only in their most general outlines.
The earth would be a simple body enough to study
with the naked eye ninety million miles away. Such
an effect as the death by lightning of a sheep in a
thunderstorm, which St Thomas would call 'contingent,' 
is really a complex physical effect, as necessary
a part of the pre-established order of physical 
causation as the alternation of day and night. <i>Positis
ponendis</i>, and leaving man out of the case, it is 
as impossible for that sheep to escape death as for the 
sun not to rise tomorrow: the only difference between the 
two cases is the multitude of <i>ponenda</i>. Cf. Chap. <A
