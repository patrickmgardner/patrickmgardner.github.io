St Thomas has five more <i>a priori</i> arguments to
the same effect, none of which, when tested by 
experience, evinces more than this, that rational creatures
have some partial control over the rest of creation. A
partial control, for, so far as we can pronounce,
what rational or intelligent creature has anything to
say to the ice at the North Pole, to the inner fires of
the earth, to the courses of the stars?
