Kant's distinction between understanding and 
reason is not to be looked for in St Thomas, nor in
his translator. St Thomas frequently uses the two 
terms indiscriminately: when he does distinguish
them, it is inasmuch as understanding is intuitive, 
reason discursive.  Understanding thus is the higher 
faculty. Understanding, not reason, is ascribed to God
and the angels.
