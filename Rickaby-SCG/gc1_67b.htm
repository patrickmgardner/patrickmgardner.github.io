This uncertainty, as I have argue in the previous 
note, is a mere incident of the ignorance and
infirmity of our minds in dealing with a complex
case of causality. To an omniscient mind there would
be no uncertainty. Such a mind would read the 
contingent event as necessarily contained in and 
necessarily following from its causes. I speak of events of
pure physical causation: for, as I have said, of such
only is there question here. I allow for the dependence 
of all physical nature upon the free will of God,
creating things, preserving them in being and activity,
fixing a certain collocation of causes from the first,
and occasionally by His own special action interfering 
(as man in an inferior way also interferes) with
the course of nature, by what is called a miracle.
