<H1>That there is Love in God.<A HREF="gc1_91a.htm">*</a></h1>

IT is of the essential idea of love, that whoever loves wishes the good 
of the object loved. But God wishes His own good and the good of other 
beings (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_75.htm">LXXV</a>); and in this respect He 
loves Himself and other beings.<p>

2. It is a requisite of true love to love the good of another inasmuch 
as it is his good. But God loves the good of every being as it is the 
good of that being, though He does also subordinate one being to the 
profit of another.<p>

3. The essential idea of love seems to be this, that the affection of 
one tends to another as to a being who is in some way one with himself. 
The greater the bond of union, the more intense is the love. And again 
the more intimately bound up with the lover the bond of union is, the 
stronger the love. But that bond whereby all things are united with 
God, namely, His goodness, of which all things are imitations, is to 
God the greatest and most intimate of bonds, seeing that He is Himself 
His own goodness. There is therefore in God a love, not only true, but 
most perfect and strong.<p> 

But some might be of opinion that God does not love one object more 
than another; for a higher and a lower degree of intensity of affection 
is characteristic of a changeable nature, and cannot be attributed to 
God, from whom all change is utterly removed. Besides, wherever else 
there is mention of any divine activity, there is no question of more 
and less: thus one thing is not known by God more than another. In 
answer to this difficulty we must observe that whereas other activities 
of the soul are concerned with one object only, love alone seems to 
tend to two. For love wishes something to somebody: hence the things 
that we desire, we are properly said to 'desire,' not to 'love,' but in 
them we rather love ourselves for whom we desire them. Every divine act 
then is of one and the same intensity; but love may be said to admit of 
'greater and less' in two ways, either in point of the good that we 
will to another, in which way we are said to love him more to whom we wish 
greater good; or again in point of the intensity of the act, in which way 
we are said to love him more to whom we wish, not indeed a greater 
good, but an equal good more fervently and effectually.  In the former 
way then there is nothing to object to in the saying that God loves one 
more than another, inasmuch as He wishes him a greater good: but, 
understood of the second way, the saying is not tenable.<p> 

Hence it appears that of our affections there is none that can properly 
be in God except joy and love, though even these are in Him not by way 
of passion, as they are in us. That there is in God joy or delight is 
confirmed by the authority of Holy Scripture. <i>I was delighted day by 
day playing before him</i>, says the Divine Wisdom, which is God (Prov. 
viii, 30).  The Philosopher also says that God ever rejoices with one 
simple delight.<A HREF="gc1_91b.htm">*</a> The Scripture also speaks of 
love in God: <i>With everlasting love I have loved thee</i> (Jer. xxxi, 
3); <i>For the Father himself loveth you</i> (John xvi, 27).<p>

But even other affections (<i>affectiones</i>), which are specifically 
inconsistent with divine perfection, are predicated in Holy Writ of 
God, not properly but metaphorically, on account of likeness of 
effects. Thus sometimes the will in following out the order of wisdom 
tends to the same effect to which one might be inclined by a passion, 
which would argue a certain imperfection: for the judge punishes from a 
sense of justice, as an angry man under the promptings of anger. So 
sometimes God is said to be 'angry,' inasmuch as in the order of His 
wisdom He means to punish some one: <i>When his anger shall blaze out 
suddenly</i> (Ps. ii, 13).  He is said to be 'compassionate,' inasmuch 
as in His benevolence He takes away the miseries of men, as we do the 
same from a sentiment of pity: <i>The Lord is merciful and compassionate, 
patient and abounding in mercy</i> (Ps. cli, 8).  Sometimes also He is 
said to be 'repentant,' inasmuch as in the eternal and immutable order 
of His providence, He builds up what He had previously destroyed, or 
destroys what He had previously made, as we do when moved by 
repentance: <i>It repenteth me that I have made man</i> (Gen. vi, 6, 7).  
God is also said to be 'sad,' inasmuch as things happen contrary to 
what He loves and approves, as sadness is in us at what happens against 
our will: <i>And the Lord saw, and it seemed evil in his eyes, 
because judgement is not: God saw that there is no man, and he was 
displeased, because there was none to meet him</i> (Isa. lix, 15, 16).
