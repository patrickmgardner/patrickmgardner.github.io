Reasoning all rests ultimately on intuitive first
principles. All men 'intue' something: but a man of
genius intues far beyond other men.  His followers take
his word an trust. To the world at large, the soundness

a slow process of reasoning. Instances are found in
Newton's <i>Principia</i> ia and the campaigns of Marlbro.
