<H1>That neither all Good Works nor all Sins are Equal<A 
HREF="gc3_140a.htm">*</a></h1>

COUNSELS are not given except of the better good. But in the divine law 
there are given counsels of poverty and continency: these then are 
better than the use of matrimony and the possession of temporal estate, 
which things however are quite consistent with virtuous action.<p> 

2. Acts are specified by their objects. The better therefore the object, 
the more virtuous will be the act according to its species. But the end 
is better than the means thereto; and in the category of means the 
better is that which comes nearer to the end. Therefore among human acts 
that is the best, which tends straight to God, the last end; and after 
that, an act is better in its species according as its object is nearer 
to God.<p> 

3. Good is in human acts according as they are regulated by reason. But
some acts come nearer to reason than others: acts which are acts of reason
itself have more of the good of reason in them than the acts of the lower
powers commanded by reason.<A HREF="gc3_140b.htm">*</a><p>

4. The commandments of the law are best fulfilled by love (Chap. 
CXXVIII). But one man may do his duty out of greater love than 
another.<p> 

6. The better act is the act of the better virtue. But one virtue is 
better than another: thus munificence is better than liberality, and 
high-souled conduct in a high position (<i>magnanimitas</i>) than 
decency in a lowly state (<i>moderantia</i>, i.e., 
<b>metriot&ecirc;s</b>).<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>He who joineth his virgin in marriage doth well: 
but he who joineth her not doth better</i> (1 Cor. vii, 38).<p> 

By the same reasons it appears that not all sins are equal: for one sin 
goes wider of the last end than another sin, is a greater perversion of 
the order of reason, and does greater harm to one's neighbour. Hence it 
is said: <i>Thou hast done more wicked things than they in all thy 
ways</i> (Ezech. xvi, 47).<p> 

But there may seem to be some reason in the position that all virtuous 
acts are equal, if we consider that every virtuous act is directed to a 
final good: hence, if there is the same final good for all virtuous 
acts, they must all be equally good. -- It is to be replied that, though 
there is one final end of goodness, nevertheless there is a difference 
of degree in the good things that are referred to that end, some of them 
being better than others and nigher to the last end. Hence there will be 
degrees of goodness in the will and its acts according to the diversity 
of good objects to which the will and its acts are terminated, though 
the ultimate end be the same.<A HREF="gc3_140c.htm">*</a><p> 

Or again it may be argued that all sins are equal, because sin in human 
acts comes solely of overpassing the rule of reason: but he overpasses 
the rule of reason who swerves from it in a small matter, equally with 
him who swerves from it in a great one; just as, if a line be drawn, not 
to be overstepped, it comes to the same thing in court whether the 
trespasser has overstepped it little or much; or as a boxer is cast, 
once he has gone outside the limits of the ring, little or much: so 
then, once a man has overstepped the bounds of reason, the amount of his 
transgression makes no difference. On careful consideration, however, it 
appears that in all cases where perfection and goodness consists in a 
certain conformity to measure, the evil will be the greater, the greater 
the departure from that due conformity. Thus health consists in a due 
blending of humours, and beauty in a due proportion of features and 
limbs, and truth in a conformity of thought or speech to fact. The 
greater the unevenness of humours, the greater the sickness: the greater 
the incongruity of features or limbs, the greater the ugliness; and the 
greater the departure from truth, the greater the falsehood: thus the 
reckoning is not so false that brings in 5 for 3 as that which brings in 
100 for 3. But the good of virtue consists in a certain conformity to 
measure: for virtue is a mean, according to due limitation under the 
circumstances, between contrary vices. Wickedness then is greater, the 
further it is out of this harmony. Nor is transgressing the limits of 
virtue like transgressing bounds fixed by a court. For virtue being of 
itself good, the transgression of it is of itself evil; and therefore 
the greater the departure from virtue, the greater the evil. But the 
transgression of a limit fixed by a court is not of itself evil, but 
only accidentally so, inasmuch as it is forbidden. But in these 
accidental connexions, though the being of one thing at all follows upon 
another's being at all, it does not follow that the being of the one 
thing in a higher degree follows upon the other's coming to be in a 
higher degree. Thus if a white body is musical, it does not follow that 
the whiter the body, the more musical: but it does follow that if 
whiteness is distinctive of vision, a stronger whiteness wilt be more 
distinctive.<A HREF="gc3_140d.htm">*</a><p> 

A noteworthy difference between sins is that between mortal and venial 
sin. A mortal sin is one that deprives the soul of spiritual life. The 
essence of spiritual life consists in two things, according to the 
likeness of natural life. Just as the body lives naturally by its union 
with the soul, which is the principle of life; and again, quickened by 
the soul, the body moves of itself, while a dead body either remains 
immovable, or is moved only by an exterior power:<A 
HREF="gc3_140e.htm">*</a> so is man's will alive, when conjoined by a 
right intention with its last end, which is its object and, as it were, 
its form; and in thus cleaving by love to God and to its neighbour, it 
is moved by an interior principle of action. But when a right intention 
of the last end and love is gone, the soul is, as it were, dead, and no 
longer moves of itself to do any right actions, but either wholly gives 
over doing them, or is led to do them only by an exterior principle, to 
wit, the fear of punishment.<A HREF="gc3_140f.htm">*</a> Whatever sins 
therefore stand not with a right intention of the last end and love, are 
mortal sins: but, so long as these finalities are attended to, any 
deficiency in point of right order of reason will not be a mortal sin, 
but venial.
