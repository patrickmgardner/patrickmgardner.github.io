Something of the sort is in <i>Eth. Nic.</i> I, 8:
"All existing facts are in harmony with truth, but
truth quickly shows itself out of harmony with falsehood." 
A false opinion on a complex issue is never
wholly false: it must be borne out by some measure
of facts; and these facts ultimately fall in with the
true opinion, and the true opinion with them.
