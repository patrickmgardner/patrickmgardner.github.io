The reference is to Aristotle, <i>Of memory and recollection</i>, I, 9 
"It is clear to which of the several portions of soul memory belongs, 
that it belongs where phantasy belongs; and the ordinary objects of 
memory are the objects of phantasy, while objects of intellect, which 
cannot be without phantasy, are incidental objects of memory." -- The 
<i>vis cogitativa</i>, or passive intellect, St Thomas refers to the 
same class as phantasy and memory.
