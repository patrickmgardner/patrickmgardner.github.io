<H1>Of the Opinion of those who withdraw from Natural Things their 
Proper Actions</h1> 

SOME have taken an occasion  of going wrong by thinking that no 
creature has any action in the production of natural effects, -- thus 
that fire does not warm, but God causes heat where fire is present. So 
Avicebron<A HREF="gc3_69a.htm">*</a> in his book, <i>The Fountain of 
Life</i>, lays it down that no body is active, but the power of a 
subsistent spirit permeating bodies does the actions which seem to be 
done by bodies. But on such theories many awkward consequences 
follow.<p> 

1. If no inferior cause, and especially no corporeal cause, does any 
work, but God works alone in all agencies, and God does not change by 
working in different agencies; no difference of effect will follow from 
the difference of agencies in which God works: but that is false by the 
testimony of sense.<p> 

2. It is contrary to the notion of wisdom for anything to be to no 
purpose in the works of the wise. But if created things in no way work 
to the production of effects, but God alone works all effects 
immediately, to no purpose are other things employed by Him.<p> 

3. To grant the main thing is to grant the accessories. But actually to 
do follows upon actually to be: thus God is at once pure actuality and 
the first cause. If then God has communicated to other beings His 
likeness in respect of being, it follows that He has communicated to 
them His likeness in respect of action.<p> 

4. To detract from the perfection of creatures is to detract from the 
perfection of the divine power. But if no creature has any action in 
the production of any effect, much is detracted from the perfection of 
the creature: for it marks abundance of perfection to be able to 
communicate to another the perfection which one has oneself.<p> 

5. God is the sovereign good (B. I, Chap. XLI). Therefore it belongs to 
Him to do the best. But it is better for good conferred on one to be 
common to many than for it to be confined to that one: for common good 
always proves to be more godlike than the good of the individual. But 
the good of one comes to be common to many when it is derived from one 
to many, which cannot be except in so far as the agent diffuses it to 
others by a proper action of its own. God then has communicated His 
goodness in such a way that one creature can transmit to others the 
good which it has received.<p> 

6. To take away order from creation is to take away the best thing that 
there is in creation: for while individual things in themselves are 
good, the conjunction of them all is best by reason of the order in the 
universe: for the whole is ever better than the parts and is the end of 
the parts. But if actions are denied to things, the order of things to 
one another is taken away: for things differing in their natures are 
not tied up in the unity of one system otherwise than by this, that 
some act and some are acted upon.<p> 

7. If effects are not produced by the action of creatures, but only by 
the action of God, it is impossible for the power of any creature to be 
manifested by its effect: for an effect shows the power of the cause 
only by reason of the action, which proceeds from the power and is 
terminated to the effect. But the nature of a cause is not known 
through its effect except in so far as through its effect its power is 
known which follows upon its nature.<A HREF="gc3_69b.htm">*</a> If then 
created things have no actions of their own productive of effects, it 
follows that the nature of a created thing can never be known by its 
effect; and thus there is withdrawn from us all investigation of 
natural science, in which demonstrations are given principally through 
the effect.<A HREF="gc3_69c.htm">*</a><p> 

Some Doctors of the Moorish Law are said to bring an argument to show 
that accidents are not traceable to the action of bodies, the ground of 
the argument being this, that an accident does not pass from subject to 
subject: hence they count it an impossibility for heat to pass from a 
hot body to another body heated by it, but they say that all such 
accidents are created by God. Now this is a ridiculous proof to assign 
of a body not acting, to point to the fact that no accident passes from 
subject to subject. When it is said that one hot body heats another, it 
is not meant that numerically the same heat, which is in the heating 
body, passes to the body heated; but that by virtue of the heat, which 
is in the heating body, numerically another heat comes to be in the 
heated body actually, which was in it before potentially. For a natural 
agent does not transfer its own form to another subject, but reduces 
the subject upon which it acts from potentiality to actuality.<A
