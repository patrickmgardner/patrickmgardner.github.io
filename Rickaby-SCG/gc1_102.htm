<H1>That the Happiness of God is most perfect, and
exceeds all other happiness</h1>

WHERE there is greater love, there is greater delight in the attainment 
of the object loved.  But every being, other things being equal, loves 
itself more than it loves anything else: a sign of which is that, the 
nearer anything is to oneself, the more it is naturally loved. God 
therefore takes greater delight in His happiness, which is Himself, 
than other blessed ones in their happiness, which is not what they 
are.<p> 

3. What is by essence, ranks above what is by participation. But God is 
happy by His essence, a prerogative that can belong to no other: for 
nothing else but God can be the sovereign good; and thus whatever else 
is happy must be happy by participation from Him.  The divine happiness 
therefore exceeds all other happiness.<p> 

4. Perfect happiness consists in an act of the understanding.  But no 
other act of understanding can compare with God's act: as is clear, not 
only from this that it is a subsistent act,<A HREF="gc1_102a.htm">*</a> 
but also because by this one act God perfectly understands Himself as 
He is, and all things that are and are not, good and evil; whereas in 
all other intellectual beings the act of understanding is not itself 
subsistent, but is the act of a subsistent subject. Nor can any one 
understand God, the supreme object of understanding, so perfectly as He 
is perfect, because the being of none is so perfect as the divine 
being, nor can any act ever be more perfect than the substance of which 
it is the act.<A HREF="gc1_102b.htm">*</a> Nor is there any other 
understanding that knows even all that God can do: for if it did, it 
would comprehend the divine power. Lastly, even what another 
understanding does know, it does not know all with one and the same 
act. God therefore is incomparably happy above all other beings.<p>

The more a thing is brought to unity, the more perfect is its power and 
excellence. But an activity that works in succession, is divided by 
different divisions of time: in no way then can its perfection be 
compared to the perfection of an activity that is without succession, 
all present together, especially if it does not pass in an instant but 
abides to eternity. Now the divine act of understanding is without 
succession, existing all together for eternity: whereas our act of 
understanding is in succession by the accidental attachment to it of 
continuity and time.  Therefore the divine happiness infinitely exceeds 
human happiness, as the duration of eternity exceeds the 'now in flux' 
of time (<i>nunc temporis fluens</i>).<p>

6. The fatigue and various occupations whereby our contemplation in 
this life is necessarily interrupted, -- in which contemplation whatever 
happiness there is for man in this life chiefly consists, -- and the 
errors and doubts and various mishaps to which the present life is 
subject, show that human happiness, in this life particularly, can in 
no way compare with the happiness of God.<p>

7. The perfection of the divine happiness may be gathered from this, 
that it embraces all happinesses according to the most perfect mode of 
each. By way of contemplative happiness, it has a perfect and 
perpetual view of God Himself and of other beings. By way of active 
life, it has the government, not of one man, or of one house, or of one 
city, or of one kingdom, but of the whole universe. Truly, the false 
happiness of earth is but a shadow of that perfect happiness.  For it 
consists, according to Boethius, in five things, in pleasure, riches, 
power, dignity and fame. God then has a most excellent delight of 
Himself, and a universal joy of all good things, without admixture of 
contrary element. For riches, He has absolute self-sufficiency of all 
good. For power, He has infinite might. For dignity, He has primacy and 
rule over all beings. For fame, He has the admiration of every 
understanding that in any sort knows Him. To Him then, who is 
singularly blessed, be honour and glory for ever and ever, Amen.<A
