<H1>Explanation of the Texts which Arius used to allege for 
himself</h1>

THAT <i>they may know thee, the only true God</i> (John xvii, 3) is not 
to be taken to mean that the Father alone is true God, as though the 
Son were not true God, but that the one sole true Godhead belongs to 
the Father, without however the Son being excluded from it. Hence John, 
interpreting these words of the Lord, attributes to the true Son both 
these titles which here our Lord ascribes to His Father: <i>That we may 
know the true God, and be in his true Son Jesus Christ: this is the 
true God and life everlasting</i> (1 John v, 20).<A 
HREF="gc4_8a.htm">*</a> But even though the Son had confessed that the 
Father alone is true God, He should not for that be understood Himself 
as Son to be excluded from Godhead; for since the Father and the Son 
are one God, whatever is said of the Father by reason of His Divinity 
is as though it were said of the Son, and conversely. Thus the Lord's 
saying: <i>No one knoweth the Son but the Father, nor does any one know 
the Father but the Son</i> (Matt. xi, 27), is not to be understood as 
excluding the Father from knowledge of Himself, or the Son either.<p> 

2. In the text, <i>Whom in his own time he will show forth, who is 
blessed and alone poweful, King of Kings and Lord of Lords</i> (1 Tim.. 
vi, 15), it is not the Father that is named, but that which is common 
to the Father and the Son. For that the Son also is King of Kings and 
Lord of Lords, is manifestly shown in the text: <i>He was clad in a 
garment sprinkled with blood, and his name was called, the Word of God: 
and he hath on his garment and on his thigh written, King of Kings and 
Lord of Lords</i> (Apoc. xix, 13, 16).<p> 

3. The sense of the text, <i>the Father is greater than I</i> (John 
xiv, 28), is taught us by the Apostle (Phil. ii, 6). For since 
'greater' is relative to 'less,' this must be understood of the Son 
according as He is made less; and He was made less in His taking the 
<i>form of a servant</i>, yet withal being equal to God the Father in 
<i>the form of God</i>. And no wonder if on this account the Father is 
said to be greater than Him, since the Apostle says that He was even 
made less than the angels: <i>That Jesus, who was made a little less than 
the angels, we have seen crowned with glory and honour for his 
suffering of death</i> (Heb. ii, 9.: cf. Ps. viii, 4-6).<p> 

4. <i>Then the Son also himself shall be subject to him who subjected 
to him all things</i>.<A HREF="gc4_8b.htm">*</a> The context here shows 
that this is to be understood of Christ as man: for as man He died, 
and as man He rose again: but in His divinity, doing all things that 
the Father does (John v, 19), He too has subjected to Himself all 
things: for <i>we look for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will 
reform the body of our lowliness, made conformable to the body of his 
glory, by the act of his power of subjecting all things to himself</i> 
(Phil. iii, 20).<p> 

5. By the Father being said to give to the Son (John iii, 35: Matt. xi, 
27), nothing else is understood than the generation of the Son, whereby 
the Father has given the Son His own nature  And this may be gathered 
from the consideration of that which is given: for the Lord says: 
<i>That which my Father hath given me is greater than all</i> (John x, 
29): where that which is <i>greater than all</i> is the divine nature, 
wherein the Son is equal to the Father.<A HREF="gc4_8c.htm">*</a><p> 

6. Hence it appears how the Son is said to be <i>taught</i> (John v, 
20: xv, 15), although He is not ignorant. It has been shown above that, 
in God, understanding and being are the same (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_45.htm">XLV</a>): hence the communication of the divine 
nature is also a communication of intelligence. But a communication of 
intelligence may be called a 'showing,' or 'speaking,' or 'teaching.' 
By the fact, then, of the Son having received the divine nature of His 
Father at His birth, He is said to have 'heard' from His Father, or the 
Father to have 'shown' Him: not that the Son was in ignorance before, 
and afterwards the Father taught Him: for the Apostle confesses 
<i>Christ the power of God and wisdom of God</i> (1 Cor. i, 24); and 
wisdom cannot be ignorant, or power weak.<p> 

7. The text, <i>The Son cannot do anything of himself</i> (John v, 19), 
argues no weakness in the Son; but since with God to act is no other 
thing than to be, it is here said that the Son cannot act of Himself, 
but has His action of the Father, as He cannot be of Himself, but only 
of the Father. Were He to be 'of Himself,' He could not be the Son. But 
because the Son receives the same nature that the Father has, and 
consequently the same power, therefore though He neither is 'of 
Himself' (<i>a se</i>) nor acts of Himself, still He is 'by Himself' 
(<i>per se</i>) and acts by Himself, since He at once is by His own 
nature, which He has received from the Father, and acts by His own 
nature received from the Father.<A HREF="gc4_8d.htm">*</a> Hence, to 
show that though the Son does not act 'of Himself,' nevertheless He 
acts 'by Himself,' the verse goes on: <i>Whatsoever things he (the 
Father) doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner</i>.<p> 

8. All the texts about the Father giving commandment to the Son, and 
the Son obeying the Father, or praying to the Father, are to be 
understood of the Son as He is subject to His Father, which is only in 
point of the humanity which He has assumed (John xiv, 31: xv, 10: Phil. 
ii, 8), as the Apostle shows (Heb. v, 7: Gal. iv, 4). 

10. His saying, <i>To sit on my right or left hand is not mine to give 
you, but to them for whom it is prepared</i> (Matt. xx, 23), does not 
show that the Son has no power of distributing the seats in heaven, or 
the participation of life everlasting, which He expressly says does 
belong to Him to bestow: <i>I give them life everlasting</i> (John x, 
27); and again it is said: <i>The Father hath given all judgement to 
the Son</i> (John v, 22): <i>He will set the sheep on his right hand 
and the goats on his left</i> (Matt. xxv, 33): it belongs then to the 
power of the Son to set any one on His right or on His left, whether 
both designations mark different degrees of glory; or the one refers to 
glory, the other to punishment. We must look to the context, whereby it 
appears that the mother of the sons of Zebedee rested on some 
confidence of kindred with the man Christ.<A HREF="gc4_8e.htm">*</a> 
The Lord then by His answer did not mean that it was not in His power 
to give what was asked, but that it was not in His power to give to 
them for whom it was asked:<A HREF="gc4_8f.htm">*</a> for it did not 
belong to Him to give inasmuch as He was the Son of the Virgin, but 
inasmuch as He was the Son of God; and therefore it was not His to 
give to any for their connexion with Him according to fleshly kindred, 
as He was the Son of the Virgin, but it belonged to Him as Son of God 
to give to those for whom it was prepared by His Father according to 
eternal predestination.<p> 

11. Nor from the text: <i>Of that day and hour no one knoweth, no, not 
the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but my Father alone</i> (Mark xiii, 
32):<A HREF="gc4_8g.htm">*</a> can it be understood that the Son did 
not know the hour of His coming, seeing that in Him are hidden all 
treasures of wisdom and knowledge (Col. ii, 3), and seeing that He 
perfectly knows that which is greater still, namely, the Father (Matt. 
xi, 27):<A HREF="gc4_8h.htm">*</a> but the meaning is that the Son, as 
a man in His place amongst men, behaved Himself after the manner of one 
ignorant in not revealing that day to His disciples. For it is a usual 
mode of speaking in Scripture for God to be said to know a thing, if He 
makes it known: thus, <i>Now I know that thou fearest the Lord</i> 
(Gen. xxii, 12), means 'I have made it known.' And contrariwise the Son 
is said not to know that which He does not make known to us.
