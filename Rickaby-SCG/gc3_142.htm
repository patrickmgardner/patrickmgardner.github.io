<H1>Of the Difference and Order of Punishments</h1>

EVIL is the privation of good: hence the order and difference of 
punishments must be according to the difference and order of good 
things. The chief good and final end of man is happiness: the higher 
good for him then is that which comes nearer to this end. Coming nearest 
to it of all is virtue, and whatever else advances man to good acts 
leading to happiness: next is a due disposition of reason and of the 
powers subject to it: after that, soundness of bodily health, which is 
necessary to unfettered action: lastly, exterior goods, as accessory 
aids to virtue.<A HREF="gc3_142a.htm">*</a> The greatest punishment 
therefore for man will be exclusion from happiness: after that, the 
privation of virtue, and of any perfection of supernatural 
(<i>supernaturalium</i>) powers in his soul for doing well: then the 
disorder of the natural powers of his soul: after that, the harm of 
his body; and finally the taking away of exterior goods.<p> 

But because it belongs to the idea of pain not only that it should be a 
privation of good, but also that it should be contrary to the will, and 
not every man's will esteems goods as they really are, but sometimes the 
privation of the greater good is less contrary to the will, and 
therefore seems less of a punishment, it so comes about that the 
majority of men, esteeming sensible and corporeal things more and 
knowing them better than the good things of the intellect and the 
spirit, dread corporeal penalties more than spiritual ones: thus in 
their estimation the order of punishments is the very reverse of that 
aforesaid. With them, injuries to the body and losses of exterior things 
make the greatest punishment: but as for disorder of the soul and loss 
of virtue and forfeiture of the enjoyment of God, in which the final 
happiness of man consists, all this they count little or nothing. Hence 
it is that they do not consider the sins of men to be punished by God, 
because they see usually sinners enjoying good health and the blessings 
of exterior fortune, of which sometimes virtuous men are deprived. This 
ought not to appear surprising to persons who look straight at the 
facts. For since all exterior things are referable to things interior, 
and the body to the soul, exterior and corporeal good things are really 
good for man in so far as they turn to the good of reason within him; 
and turn to his evil so far as they hinder that good of reason. Now God, 
the disposer of all things, knows the measure of human virtue: hence He 
sometimes supplies a virtuous man with corporeal and exterior good 
things to aid his virtue, and does him a favour in so doing: sometimes 
again He withdraws the aforesaid things, considering them to be an 
obstacle to man's virtue and enjoyment of God. Where they are such an 
obstacle, exterior good things turn to a man's prejudice, and the loss 
of them to his gain. If then punishment in every case means the 
infliction of some evil, and it is not an evil for a man to be deprived 
of exterior and corporeal good things so far as is conducive to his 
advancement in virtue, such deprivation will not be a punishment to a 
virtuous man: on the other hand a real punishment to the wicked will be 
the concession to them of exterior goods, whereby they are incited to 
evil. Hence it is said: <i>The creatures of God are turned to hate, and 
to a temptation to the souls of men, and a trap for the feet of the 
unwise</i> (Wisd. xiv, 11). But because it is of the notion of 
punishment not only to be an infliction of evil, but further an evil 
contrary to the will, the loss of corporeal and exterior goods, even 
when it makes for advancement in virtue and not for evil, is called 
punishment by a  stretch of language, inasmuch as it is contrary to the 
will.
