<H1>That the Mind of an Intelligence subsisting apart is ever in the 
act of understanding</h1> 

What is sometimes in actuality, sometimes in potentiality, is measured 
by time. But the mind of an intelligence subsisting apart is above 
time (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_96.htm">XCVI</a>). Therefore it is not at 
times in the act of understanding and at times not.<p> 

2. Every living substance has by its nature some actual vital activity 
always going on in it, although other activities are potential: thus 
animals are always repairing waste by assimilation of nourishment, 
though they do not always feel. But separately subsisting 
intelligences are living substances, and have no other vital activity 
but that of understanding. Therefore by their nature they must be 
always actually understanding.<p>
