All  graces are given  gratuitously;  but  some graces constitute the 
recipient in the state of grace, as <i>sanctifying</i>, or 
<i>habitual</i> grace: or help him in or towards the state of grace, as 
<i>actual</i> grace: these are called <i>gratia gratum faciens</i>. 
They go to sanctify the recipient. Other graces are not given for the 
recipient, but for the sake of others, and do not of themselves make   
for the sanctification of him who has them. Such graces, called 
<i>gratia gratis data</i>, include the miraculous powers discussed in 
this chapter, and in 1 Cor. xii, xiv.
