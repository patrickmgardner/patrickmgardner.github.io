<H1>How the Law of God relates a man to his Neighbour</h1>

OF all things that man makes use of, the chief are other men. Man is 
naturally a social animal, needing many things that the individual 
cannot procure by himself. The divine law therefore must needs instruct 
man to live according to the order of reason in his relations with 
other men.<p> 

2. The end of the divine law is to bring man to cleave to God. Now man 
is aided thereto by his fellow-man, as well in point of knowledge as in 
point of affection: for men help one another in the knowledge of the 
truth, and one incites another to good and restrains him from evil. 
Hence it is said: <i>Iron is sharpened by iron, and man sharpens the 
face of his friend</i> (Prov. xxvii, 17): <i>Better two together than 
one,</i> etc. (Eccles iv, 9-12).<p> 

There is then orderly concord amongst men, when to each there is 
rendered his own, which is the act of justice; and therefore it is said: 
<i>The work of justice is peace</i> (Isa. xxxii, 17). To the observance 
of this justice man is inclined both by an interior and an exterior 
principle. By an interior principle, in so far as a man has a will to 
observe the precepts of the divine law, which is done by his bearing 
love to God and to his neighbour: for whoever loves another renders him 
his due spontaneously and with pleasure, and even acts more by 
liberality: hence the whole fulfilment of the law hinges upon love 
(Rom. xiii, 10: Matt. xxii, 40). But because some are not so inwardly 
disposed as to do of their own accord what the law commands, they have 
to be dragged by an exterior force to the fulfilment of the justice of 
the law; and so they fulfil the law under fear of penalties, not as 
freemen but as slaves. Hence it is said: <i>When thou shalt do thy 
judgements upon the earth</i> by punishing the wicked, <i>the 
inhabitants of earth shall learn justice</i> (Isa. xxvi, 9). Others are 
so disposed as to do of their own accord what the law bids them. They 
are a law to themselves, having charity, which bends their wills in 
place of a law to generous conduct. There was no need of an exterior law 
being enacted for them: hence it is said: <i>The law was not made for 
the just, but for the unjust</i>: which is not to be taken to mean that 
the just are not bound to fulfil the law, as some have misunderstood 
the text, but that the just are inclined of themselves to do justice 
even without a law.
