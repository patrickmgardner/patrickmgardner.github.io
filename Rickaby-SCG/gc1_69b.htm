At the end of this chapter, St Thomas tells us
that beings are not infinite: i.e., there is not an infinite 
multitude of actual existences, and by no process 
of creation ever will there be.  God's knowledge
of infinite things then can only refer to an infinite
multitude of things possible, but nonexistent. Then
the curious question comes: how far do things, purely
possible and never existent, make number, or multitude? 
Are ten purely possible soldiers ten distinct entities? 
I think not, if they are taken to be perfectly alike.  
But possible differences are infinite.  The question has
a bearing on the reality of the abstract science of number.
