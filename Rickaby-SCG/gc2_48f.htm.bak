Action is self-determined in all animals: judgement on the 
propriety of action is self-determined in man alone among animals. That 
self-determination of judgement means free will. Free will is due to 
the power of forming universal ideas, or general concepts, of the 
suitable and the good (or to what Plato might have called the vision of 
the idea of the good -- <i>Rep.</i> VI, 505: cf. <i>Phaedrus</i>, 248, 
249). Such is the momentous teaching of St Thomas in this chapter.
