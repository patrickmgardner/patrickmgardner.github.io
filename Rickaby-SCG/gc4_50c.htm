Understand, 'in the present order of providence,' not in that possible, 
but unrealised order of mere nature, in which God never intends to 
raise His rational creature to grace and beatific vision. Cf. B. III, 
Chap. <A HREF="gc3_50.htm">L</a>, with notes. In the order of mere 
nature, what Catholic divines now understand by 'original sin' would 
have been an impossibility. Of this difficult doctrine of original sin, 
the best English exposition is in the Essay on the Immaculate 
Conception in the late Father Harper's <i>Peace through the Truth</i>, 
First Series.
