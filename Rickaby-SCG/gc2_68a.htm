If a man is, let us say, a Master of Arts, the <i>formal</i> principle, 
whereby he is such, is the degree itself; the <i>efficient</i> 
principle is the authority of the University which conferred the 
degree; while the man, on whom it is conferred, is the <i>matter</i>.  
This form is not <i>substantial</i>, but <i>accidental</i>: the man 
would be a man without it.  But without his soul he would not be a man.
