e.g., one who has no genius for painting, taking lessons in painting 
from a Murillo, is incapable of receiving a <i>form</i>, or quality, of 
<i>painter</i> like that which his master has.  Murillo is a painter of 
another species than his pupil. If both are called <i>painters</i>, 
they do not bear the designation in the same sense.
