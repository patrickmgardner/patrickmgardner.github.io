This distinction between the dictate (or exigency) 
of nature, and the divine law, answering to
what Cardinal Newman calls " the critical and the
judicial function of conscience" (<i>Grammar of Assent</i>
pp. 102-107), is of the first importance in the theory
of morals. I have endeavoured to bring it out elsewhere: 
<i>Ethics and Natural Law</i>, pp. 109-125. St
Thomas speaks of the 'divine law' as known in the
Jewish and Christian revelation. In a 'state of pure
nature,' without revelation, we should have had to
argue <i>a priori</i> that God must have willed to ratify the
exigences of human nature and natural reason, and
command their observance. What those exigences of
nature are see Chap. CXXIX.
