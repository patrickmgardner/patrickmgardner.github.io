<H1>That the Providence of God watches immediately over all Individual 
Things</h1>
 
IN matters of human administration, the higher administrator confines 
his care to the arrangement of general main issues, and leaves details 
to his subordinates, and that on account of his personal limitations, 
because, as for the state and condition of lesser things, he is either 
ignorant of them, or he cannot afford the labour and length of time 
that would be necessary to arrange for them. But such limitations are 
far from God: it is no labour for Him to understand, and it takes Him 
no time, since in understanding Himself He understands all things else 
(B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_49.htm">XLIX</a>).<p> 

4. In human administrations, the industry and care of the lower 
officials arranges matters left to their charge by their chief. Their 
chief does not bestow upon them their faculty of industry and care, but 
merely allows it free play. If the industry and care came from their 
superior, the arrangement would be the superior's arrangement; and they 
would not be authors of the arrangement, but carriers of it into 
execution. But we have seen (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_51.htm">LI</a>: 
B. III, Chap. <A HREF="gc3_67.htm">LXVII</a>) that all wisdom and 
intelligence comes from God above; nor can any intellect understand 
anything except in the power of God, nor any agent do anything except 
in the same power. God Himself therefore by His providence immediately 
disposes all things; and whoever are called providers under Him, are 
executors of His providence.<A HREF="gc3_76a.htm">*</a><p>

7. If God does not by Himself take immediate care of lower 
individualities, that must be either because He despises them, or 
because He fears to sully His dignity, as some say.<A 
HREF="gc3_76b.htm">*</a> But that is irrational, for there is greater 
dignity in devising an arrangement than in working one out. If then God 
works in all things, as has been shown (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_47.htm">LXVII</a>), and that is not derogatory to His 
dignity, nay rather befits His universal and sovereign power, an 
immediate providence over individual things is no contemptible 
occupation for Him either, and throws no slur upon His dignity.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Thou hast done the things of old and hast devised 
one thing after another</i> (Judith ix, 4).
