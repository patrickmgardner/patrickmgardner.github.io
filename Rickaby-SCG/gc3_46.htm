<H1>That the Soul in this life does not understand
itself by itself</h1>

AN apparent difficulty may be alleged against what has been said from 
some words of Augustine, which require careful treatment. He says 
(<i>De Trinitate</i>, IX, iii): "As the mind gathers knowledge of 
corporeal things by the senses of the body, so of incorporeal things by 
itself: therefore it knows itself by itself, because itself is 
incorporeal." By these words it appears that our mind understands 
itself by itself, and, understanding itself, understands separately 
subsistent intelligences, or pure spirits, which would militate against 
what has been shown above. But it is clear that such is not the mind of 
Augustine. For he says (<i>De Trinitate</i>, X, ix, 12) of the soul 
seeking knowledge of itself: "Let it not then seek to find 
(<i>cernere</i>) itself as though it were absent, but let its care be 
to discern (<i>discernere</i>) itself as it is present: let it not 
observe itself as though it did not know itself but let it distinguish 
itself from that other thing which it has mistaken for itself." Whence 
he gives us to understand that the soul of itself knows itself as 
present, but not as distinct from other things; and therefore he says 
(<i>De Trin.</i> X, x) that some have erred in not distinguishing the 
soul from things that are different from it. But by the knowledge of a 
thing in its essence the thing is known as distinct from other things: 
hence definition, which marks the essence of a thing, distinguishes the 
thing defined from all other things. Augustine then did not mean that 
the soul of itself knows its own essence. So then, according to the 
thought of Augustine, our mind of itself knows itself, inasmuch as it 
knows concerning itself that it exists: for by the very perceiving of 
itself to act it perceives itself to be. But it acts of itself. 
Therefore of itself it knows concerning itself that it exists. <A

1. But it cannot be said that the soul of itself knows concerning 
itself what it essentially is. For a cognitive faculty comes to be 
actually cognisant by there being in it the object which is known. If 
the object is in it potentially, it knows potentially: if the object is 
in it actually, it is actually cognisant: if in an intermediate way, it 
is habitually cognisant. But the soul is always present to itself 
actually, and never potentially or habitually only. If then the soul of 
itself knows itself by its essence, it must ever have an intellectual 
view of itself, what it essentially is, which clearly is not the 
case.<p> 

2 and 3. If the soul of itself knows itself in its essence, every man, 
having a soul, knows the essence of the soul: which clearly is not the 
case, for many men have thought the soul to be this or that body, and 
some have taken it for a number or harmony.<p> 

So then, by knowing itself, the soul is led to know concerning 
separately subsistent intelligences the fact of their existence, but 
not what they are essentially, which would mean understanding their 
substances. For whereas we know, either by demonstration or by faith, 
concerning these pure spirits that they are intelligent subsistent 
beings, in neither way could we gather this knowledge but for the fact 
that our soul knows from itself the meaning of intelligent being. 
Hence we must use our knowledge of the intelligence of our own soul as 
a starting-point for all that we can know of separately subsistent 
intelligences. But even granting that by speculative sciences we could 
arrive at a knowledge of the essence of our own soul, it does not 
follow that we could thereby arrive at a knowledge of all that is 
knowable about pure spirits; for our intelligence falls far short of 
the intelligence of a pure spirit. A knowledge of the essence of our 
own soul might lead to a knowledge of some remote higher genus of pure 
spirits: but that would not be an understanding of their substances.<p>
