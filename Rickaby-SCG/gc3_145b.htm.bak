In modern phraseology, St Thomas would say that death sets a bound to 
man's moral evolution, at least in respect of all specific change. That 
is true, but can philosophers prove it? What is the proof of the 
present allegation? St Thomas always seems to regard the soul as, to 
some extent, crippled by separation from the body. Cf B. II, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_75.htm">LXXV</a>, arg. 1, reply: B. II, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_94.htm">XCIV</a>, nn. 3, 4. For the capabilities of the soul 
after death, <i>a priori</i> arguments go very little way; and as for 
experience, it comes to us all, but too late.
