Cf. <i>Sum. Theol.</i> 1a-2ae, q. 87, art. 3 (<i>Aquinas
Ethicus</i>, I, 254). <i>Interminable</i> here may have two 
meanings. (1) It may mean <i>final</i> in the sense that the 
person punished shall never be brought to his last end;
but whether he shall exist for ever under privation of
it, is left an open question (notwithstanding B. II,
Chap. <A HREF="gc2_79.htm">LXXIX</a>). (2) Or it may mean <i>eternal</i> 
connoting the existence of the soul for ever under privation
of the last end. That punishment is interminable in the
second sense, is a revealed truth of faith. But, revelation 
apart, it is questionable whether the <i>a priori</i>
arguments of philosophers evince more than interminability 
in the sense of <i>finality</i>, as explained under
the former head. See <i>Ethics and Natural Law</i>, pp. 
164-166. The reader will consider how far the arguments
of this chapter carry him beyond finality to positive
eternal duration.
