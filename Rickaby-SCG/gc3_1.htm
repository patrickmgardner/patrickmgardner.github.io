<H1>Preface to the Book that Follows</h1>

<i>The Lord is a great God, and a great king above all gods.  For the 
Lord will not reject his people, because in his hands are all the ends 
of the earth, and the heights of the mountains he beholdeth.  For the 
sea is his, and he made it, and his hands have formed the dry 
land.</i> (Ps. xciv).<p>

It has been shown above (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_13.htm">XIII</a>) 
that there is one first of beings, possessing the full perfection of 
all being, whom we call God.  Out of the abundance of His perfection 
He bestows being on all things that exist; and thus He proves to be 
not only the first of beings, but also the first principle of all.  He 
bestows being on other things, not out of any necessity of his nature, 
but by the free choice of His will, as has been shown (B. II, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_23.htm">XXIII</a>).  Consequently He is master of the things 
that He has made: for we have dominion over the things that are 
subject to our will.  This His dominion over the things that He has 
brought into being is a perfect dominion, since in producing them He 
needs the aid of no exterior agent, nor any subject matter to work 
upon, seeing that He is the universal efficient cause of all being.  
Of the things produced by the will of an agent every one is directed 
by that agent to some end: for some good and some end is the proper 
object of the will: hence the things that proceed from will must be 
directed to some end.  Everything attains its last end by its own 
action, which is directed by Him who has given to things the 
principles whereby they act.  It needs must be then that God, who is 
by nature perfect in Himself and by His power bestows being on all 
things that are, should be the ruler of all beings, Himself ruled by 
none: nor is there anything exempt from His government, as there is 
nothing that does not derive being from Him.  He is then perfect in 
government, as He is perfect in being and causation.<p>

The effect of this government appears variously in various natures 
according to the difference between them.  Some creatures are brought 
into being by God to possess understanding, to bear his likeness and 
present His image.  They not only are directed, but also direct 
themselves by proper actions of their own to their due end.  If in the 
direction of themselves they remain subject to the divine guidance, 
they are admitted in course of that guidance to the attainment of their 
last end.  Other beings, devoid of understanding, do not direct 
themselves to their own end, but are directed by another.  Some of 
those are imperishable; and as they can suffer no defect in their 
natural being, so in their proper actions they never deflect one whit 
from the path that leads to the end prefixed to them, but are 
indefectibly subject to the rule of the prime ruler.<A HREF="gc3_1a.htm">*</a>  Other creatures are perishable, and liable to 
the failure of their natural being, which however is compensated by the 
gain of another: for the perishing of one is the engendering of 
another.  In like manner in their proper actions they swerve from the 
natural order from which swerving however there accrues some 
compensatory good.  Hence it appears that even apparent irregularities 
and departures from the order of the first rule escape not the power of 
the first ruler.  These perishable bodies, created as they are by God, 
are perfectly subject to His power.<p>

The Psalmist, filled with God's spirit, considering this truth , and 
wishing to point out to us the divine government of things, first 
describes to us the perfection of the first ruler, -- of His nature,  
when he says <i>God</i>; of His power, when he says, <i>is a great 
Lord</i>,<A HREF="gc3_1b.htm">*</a> needing no co-operation to work the 
effect of His power; of His authority, when he says <i>a great king 
above all gods</i>, because, though there be many rulers, all are 
subject to His rule.  Secondly he describes to us the manner of 
government, -- as well in respect of intelligent beings, which follow 
His rule and gain from Him their last end, which is Himself, and 
therefore he says, <i>for the Lord will not reject his people</i>, -- 
as also in respect of perishable beings, which, however they sometimes 
depart from their proper modes of action, still are never let go beyond 
the control of the prime ruler: hence it is said, <i>in his hands are 
all the ends of the earth</i>, -- likewise in respect of the heavenly 
bodies, which exceed all the height of the earth and of perishable 
bodies, and always observe the right order of divine rule: hence he 
says, <i>and the heights of the mountains he beholdeth</i>.  Thirdly he 
assigns the reason of this universal control, which is, because things 
created by God needs must be ruled by Him: hence he says, <i>For the 
sea is his</i>, etc.<p>

Since then in the first Book we have treated of the perfection of the 
divine nature, and in the second of the perfection of God's power, it 
remains for us in this third Book to treat of His perfect authority, or 
dignity, in as much as He is the last end and ruler of all things.  
This therefore will be our order of procedure, to treat first of God, 
as the final end of all things; secondly of His universal control, 
whereby He governs every creature; thirdly of the special control 
which He exercises in the government of creatures endowed with 
understanding.
