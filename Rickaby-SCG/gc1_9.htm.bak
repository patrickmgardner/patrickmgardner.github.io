<H1>The Order and Mode of Procedure in this Work</h1>

THERE is then a twofold sort of truth in things divine for the wise man 
to study: one that can be attained by rational enquiry, another that 
transcends all the industry of reason. This truth of things divine I do 
not call twofold on the part of God, who is one simple Truth, but on 
the part of our knowledge, as our cognitive faculty has different 
aptitudes for the knowledge of divine things.  To the declaration 
therefore of the first sort of truth we must proceed by demonstrative 
reasons that may serve to convince the adversary.  But because such 
reasons are not forthcoming for truth of the second sort, our aim ought 
not to be to convince the adversary by reasons, but to refute his 
reasonings against the truth, which we may hope to do, since natural 
reason cannot be contrary to the truth of faith. The special mode of 
refutation to be employed against an opponent of this second sort of 
truth is by alleging the authority of Scripture confirmed from heaven 
by miracles. There are however some probable reasons available for the 
declaration of this truth, to the exercise and consolation of the 
faithful, but not to the convincing of opponents, because the mere 
insufficiency of such reasoning would rather confirm them in their 
error, they thinking that we assented to the truth of faith for reasons 
so weak.<A HREF="gc1_9a.htm">*</a><P> 

     According then to the manner indicated we will bend our endeavour, 
first, to the manifestation of that truth which faith professes and 
reason searches out, alleging reasons demonstrative and probable, some 
of which we have gathered from the books of philosophers and saints, 
for the establishment of the truth and the confutation of the opponent. 
Then, to proceed from what is more to what is less manifest in our 
regard, we will pass to the manifestation of that truth which 
transcends reason, solving the arguments of opponents, and by probable 
reasons and authorities, so far as God shall enable us, declaring the 
truth of faith. Taking therefore the way of reason to the pursuit of 
truths that human reason can search out regarding God, the first 
consideration that meets us is of the attributes of God in Himself; 
secondly of the coming forth of creatures from God; thirdly of the 
order of creatures to God as to their last end.<A
