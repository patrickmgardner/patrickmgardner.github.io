Hence they who deny all causative activity, and
reduce causality to a particular case of sequence, further
conclude, logically enough, that we can know nothing
of 'natures,' 'substances,' 'essences,' and 'things in

lead them to deny all potential being and all
permanent existence, and to take up with the 
Heraclitean flux.
