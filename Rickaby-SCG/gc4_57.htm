<h1>Of the Difference between the Sacraments of the Old and of the New 
Law</h1>

THESE Sacraments, having their efficacy from the Passion of Christ, 
which they represent, must fall in and correspond with the salvation 
wrought by Christ. Before the Incarnation and Passion of Christ this 
salvation was promised, but not accomplished: it was wrought by the 
Incarnation and Passion of the Word. Therefore the Sacraments that 
preceded the Incarnation of Christ must have been such as to signify 
and promise salvation:<A HREF="gc4_57a.htm">*</a> while the Sacraments 
that follow the Passion of Christ must be such as to render salvation 
to men, and not merely show it forth by signs.<p> 

This avoids the error of the Jews, who believe that the sacred rites of 
the Law must be observed for ever, because they were instituted by God, 
who repents not and changes not. There is no change or repentance about 
an arrangement, which arranges for different things to be done 
according to the fitness of different times; as the father of a family 
gives different commands to his son in his nonage and when he is come 
of age.<A HREF="gc4_57b.htm">*</a> Still more irrational was the error 
of those who said that the rites of the Law were to be observed along 
with the Gospel; an error indeed which is self-contradictory: for the 
observance of the Gospel rites is a profession that the Incarnation and 
the other mysteries of Christ are now accomplished; while the 
observance of the rites of the Law is a profession that they are still 
to be fulfilled.
