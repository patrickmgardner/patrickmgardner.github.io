<H1>That God does not understand by Combination and Separation of 
Ideas</h1> 

THINGS mentally combinable and separable are naturally considered by 
the mind apart from one another: for there would be no need of their 
combination and separation, if by the mere apprehension of a thing as 
being it were at once understood what was in it or not in it.<A 
HREF="gc1_58a.htm">*</a> If therefore God understood by a mental 
process of combination and separation, it would follow that He did not 
take in all things at one glance, but each thing apart, contrary to 
what has been shown above (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_55.htm">LV</a>).<P> 

3.  A mind that combines and separates, forms different judgements by 
different combinations. For a mental combination does not go beyond the 
terms of the combination. Hence, in the combination, or affirmative 
judgement (<i>compositione</i>), whereby the mind judges that man is an 
animal, it does not judge that a triangle is a figure. Now combination 
or separation is an operation of the mind. If God therefore views 
things by mentally combining and separating them, His mental act will 
not be one only but manifold; and so His essence will not be one 
only.<P> 

Not for this however must we say that He is ignorant of tenable 
propositions: for His one and simple essence is the pattern of all 
things manifold and compound; and so by it God knows the whole 
multitude and complexity as well of actual nature as of the ideal world 
(<i>tam naturae quam rationis</i>).<P> 

This is in consonance with the authority of Holy Scripture: for it is 
said, <i>For my thoughts are not your thoughts</i> (Isa. lv, 8); and 
yet, <i>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men</i> (Ps. xciii, 11), which 
certainly proceed by combination and separation of ideas.
