See <i>Ethics and Natural Law</i>, p. 8, n. 4; and p. 76,
n. 4. When Milton says in the <i>Comus</i><p>
<blockquote>Virtue alone is happiness below,</blockquote><p>
he cannot reasonably mean that moral virtue is formally 
and precisely happiness, but only that it is
indispensable to happiness, and presupposed, as the
base of a tower is presupposed to the spire. Moral
virtue is more indispensable, but happiness is better.
But the privation of happiness is a less evil than the
privation of moral virtue. So it is less evil to have the
spire blown down than to have the tower on which
it rests blown up, although the spire is higher and
nobler than the substructure.<p>

The doctrine of this chapter is in Aristotle, <i>Nic.
Eth.</i> X, viii.
