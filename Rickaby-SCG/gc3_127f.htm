This curious passage is in the <i>Liber de haeresibus</i>,
printed as the genuine work of St Augustine in
Tom. viii of the Maurist edition. St Athanasius, <i>Ep.
ad Dracont.</i>, mentions married monks, though they
probably were the exception. The enforcement of
clerical celibacy originally went no further than a
prohibition of marriage subsequent to ordination.
Such a marriage came readily to fall under the 
prohibition of a second marriage, which underlies the
phrase <i>husband of one wife</i>, 1 Tim. iii, 2. Like 
some other things in the Church, clerical and monastic
celibacy developed in time from a gospel germ (Matt.
xix) and apostolic practice (1 Cor. vii, 7).
