In note [<A HREF="gc4_29b.htm">4.29b</a>] a somewhat different 
interpretation is offered according to more modern views of this 
important passage. St Thomas and the older school take the 
<i>emptying</i> (<i>exinanitio</i>, <b>ken&ocirc;sis</b>) to consist in 
the Incarnation itself. The more modern view represents it as 
consisting, not in the Incarnation itself, but in the manner of life 
chosen by the Word Incarnate, a life fraught with the miseries, needs 
and liabilities of ordinary humanity, whereas the glory and 
impassibility, which He assumed only at His resurrection, was His by 
right from His mother's womb. This is the meaning of that term, so 
celebrated in modern theology, <i>kenosis</i>. If we regard the divine 
nature, the Incarnation itself was, as St Thomas says, "no loss of 
God's own greatness," which nothing can possibly diminish. Again, if we 
regard the human nature assumed at the Incarnation, that humanity, 
again to employ St Thomas's words, "was not emptied, but exalted," -- 
and that much more by the hypostatic union than by any Nestorian 
<i>inhabitatio divinitatis</i>. Either way explained, the passage tells 
against Nestorius.
