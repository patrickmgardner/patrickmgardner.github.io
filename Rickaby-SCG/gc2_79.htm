<H1>That the Human Soul does not Perish with the Body</h1>

EVERY intelligent subsisting being is imperishable (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_55.htm"> LV</a>): but the human soul is an intelligent 
subsisting being.<p>

2. Nothing is destroyed by that which makes its perfection. But the 
perfection of the human soul consists in a certain withdrawal from the 
body: for the soul is perfected by knowledge and virtue: now in 
knowledge there is greater perfection, the more the view is fixed on 
high generalisations, or immaterial things; while the perfection of 
virtue consists in a man's not following his bodily passions, but 
tempering and restraining them by reason. -- Nor is it of any avail to 
reply that the perfection of the soul consists in its separation from 
the body in point of activity, but to be separated from the body in 
point of being is its destruction. For the activity of a thing shows 
its substance and being, and follows upon its nature: thus the activity 
of a thing can only be perfected inasmuch as its substance is 
perfected. If then the soul is perfected in activity by relinquishing 
the body and bodily things, its substance cannot fail in being by 
separation from the body.<p> 

4. A natural craving cannot be in vain.<A HREF="gc2_79a.htm">*</a> But 
man naturally craves after permanent continuance: as is shown by this, 
that while existence is desired by all, man by his understanding 
apprehends existence, not in the present moment only, as dumb animals 
do, but existence absolutely. Therefore man attains to permanence on 
the part of his soul, whereby he apprehends existence absolute and for 
all time.<p>

6. Intelligible being is more permanent than sensible being. But the 
substratum of material bodies (<i>materia prima</i>) is indestructible, 
much more the potential intellect, the recipient of intelligible forms. 
Therefore the human soul, of which the potential intellect is a part, 
is indestructible.<A HREF="gc2_79b.htm">*</a><p>

8. No form is destroyed except either by the action of the contrary, or 
by the destruction of the subject wherein it resides, or by the failure 
of its cause. Thus heat is destroyed by the action of cold: by the 
destruction of the eye the power of sight is destroyed; and the light 
of the atmosphere fails by the failure of the sun's presence, which was 
its cause. But the human soul cannot be destroyed by the action of its 
contrary, for it has no contrary, since by the potential intellect the 
soul is cognitive and receptive of all contraries. Nor again by the 
destruction of the subject in which it resides, for it has been shown 
above that the human soul is a form not dependent on the body for its 
being.<A HREF="gc2_79c.htm">*</a> Nor lastly by the failure of its 
cause, for it can have no cause but one which is eternal, as will be 
shown (Chap. LXXXVII). In no way therefore can the human soul be 
destroyed.<p>

9. If the human soul is destroyed by the destruction of the body, it 
must be weakened by the weakening of the body. But the fact is that if 
any faculty of the soul is weakened by the body being weakened, that is 
only incidentally, inasmuch as that faculty of the soul stands in need 
of a bodily organ, as the sight is weakened by the weakening of the 
organ of sight, but only incidentally, as may be shown by this 
consideration: if any weakness fell essentially upon the faculty, the 
faculty would not be restored by the restoration of the organ; but now 
we see that however much the faculty of sight seems weakened, it is 
restored, if only the organ is restored.<A HREF="gc2_79d.htm">*</a> 
Since then the soul's faculty of understanding needs no bodily organ, 
the understanding itself is not weakened, neither essentially nor 
incidentally, either by old age or by any other weakness of body. But 
if in the working of the understanding there happens fatigue or 
hindrance through bodily weakness, this is not due to weakness of the 
understanding itself, but to weakness of other faculties that the 
understanding has need of, to wit, the phantasy, the memory, and the 
cogitative faculty.<A HREF="gc2_79e.htm">*</a><p>

10. The same is evidenced by the very words of Aristotle: "Moving 
causes pre-exist, but formal causes are along with the things whereof 
they are causes: for when a man is well, then there is health. But 
whether anything remains afterwards, is a point to consider: in some 
cases there may well be something remaining: the soul is an instance, 
not the whole soul, but the intelligence: as for the whole soul 
remaining, that is perhaps an impossibility."<A 
HREF="gc2_79f.htm">*</a> Clearly then, in speaking of forms, he wishes 
to speak of the intellect, which is the form of man, as remaining after 
its matter, that is, after the body. It is clear also that though 
Aristotle makes the soul a form, yet he does not represent it as non-
subsistent and consequently perishable, as Gregory of Nyssa imputes to 
him:<A HREF="gc2_79g.htm">*</a> for he excludes the intellectual soul 
from the general category of other forms, saying that it remains after 
the body and is a subsistent being (<i>substantiam quandam</i>).<A 
HREF="gc2_79h.htm">*</a><p>

Hereby is banished the error of the impious in whose person it is said: 
<i>We were born out of nothingness, and hereafter we shall be as though 
we had never been</i> (Wisd. ii, 2); in whose person again Solomon 
says: <i>One is the perishing of man and beast, and even is the lot of 
both: as man dies, so do beasts die: all breathe alike, and man hath no 
advantage over beasts</i> (Eccles iii, 19): that he does not say this 
in his own person, but in the person of the ungodly, is clear from what 
he says at the end, as it were drawing a conclusion: <i>Till the dust 
return to the earth, from whence it came; and the spirit go back to the 
God who gave it</i> (Eccles xii, 7).<p>
