<H1>That God has Understanding</h1>

IN no order of causes is it found that an intelligent cause is the 
instrument of an unintelligent one. But all causes in the world stand 
to the prime mover, which is God, as instruments to the principal 
agent.  Since then in the world there are found many intelligent 
causes, the prime mover cannot possibly cause unintelligently.<P> 

5. No perfection is wanting in God that is found in any kind of beings 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>): nor does any manner of 
composition result in Him for all that (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_18.htm">XVIII</a>).  But among the perfections of creatures 
the highest is the possession of understanding: for by understanding a 
thing is in a manner all things, having in itself the perfections of 
all things.<A HREF="gc1_44a.htm">*</a><P> 

6. Everything that tends definitely to an end, either fixes its own 
end, or has its end fixed for it by another: otherwise it would not 
tend rather to this end than to that. But the operations of nature tend 
to definite ends: the gains of nature are not made by chance: for if 
they were, they would not be the rule, but the exception, for chance is 
of exceptional cases.  Since then physical agents do not fix their own 
end, because they have no idea of an end, they must have an end fixed 
for them by another, who is the author of nature.  But He could not fix 
an end for nature, had He not Himself understanding.<A 
HREF="gc1_44b.htm">*</a><P> 

7. Everything imperfect is derived from something perfect: for 
perfection is naturally prior to imperfection, as actuality to 
potentiality.<A HREF="gc1_44c.htm">*</a> But the forms that exist in 
particular things are imperfect, for the very reason that they do exist 
in particular, and not in the universality of their idea, or the 
fulness of their ideal being.  They must therefore be derived from some 
perfect forms, which are not under particular limitations. Such forms 
cannot be other than objects of understanding, seeing that no form is 
found in its universality or ideal fulness, except in the 
understanding. Consequently such forms must be endowed with 
understanding, if they are to subsist by themselves: for only by that 
endowment can they be operative.  God therefore, who is the first 
actuality existing by itself, whence all others are derived, must be 
endowed with understanding.<A HREF="gc1_44d.htm">*</a><P>

This truth also is in the confession of Catholic faith : for it is 
said: <i>He is wise of heart and mighty of power</i> (Job ix, 4): 
<i>With him is strength and wisdom</i> (Ibid. xii, 16): <i>Thy wisdom 
is made wonderful to me</i> (Ps. cxxxviii, 6): <i>O depth of riches, of 
wisdom and of knowledge of God</i> (Rom. vi, 33).
