<i>Non tamen totaliter sanatur</i>. Though there is nothing in this 
passage of St Thomas inconsistent with the Council of Trent, Sess. 5, 
Can. 5, still I scarcely think that the Saint would have written this 
phrase had that canon been framed in his time. The Council insists on 
the axiom that there is nothing in the baptised that God hates (<i>in 
renatis nihil odit Deus</i>).<p> 

But waiving the question of language and formularies, St Thomas here 
stands on two affirmations which every Catholic must affirm with him: 
(1) that the baptised Christian, though cleansed from original sin, is 
not endowed with 'original justice,' as above defined: (2) that the 
children of baptised parents are conceived and born in original sin.
