<H1>That one may see God more perfectly than another</h1>

THE light of glory raises to the vision of God in this, that it is a 
certain likeness to the divine understanding (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_53.htm">LIII</a>). But a thing may be likened to God with 
more or less of closeness. Therefore one may see the divine substance 
with more or less of perfection.<p>

4. The end must correspond to the means taken to gain it. But not all 
subsistent intelligences are equally prepared for their end, which is 
the vision of the divine substance: for some are of greater virtue, 
some of less, virtue being the way to happiness. Therefore there must 
be a diversity in their vision of God.<p>

Hence it is said: <i>in my Father's House there are many mansions</i> 
(John xiv, 2). In the mode of vision then there appear diverse grades 
of glory among the Blessed, but in respect of the object of vision their 
glory is the same. Hence to all the labourers in the vineyard, though 
they have not laboured equally, the Lord tells us that the same reward, 
or penny, is to be given, because the same object is given to all to see 
and enjoy, namely, God.<p>
