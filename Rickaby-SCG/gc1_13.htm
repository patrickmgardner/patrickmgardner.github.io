<H1>Reasons in Proof of the Existence of God</h1>

WE will put first the reasons by which Aristotle proceeds to prove the 
existence of God from the consideration of motion as follows.<P> 

Everything that is in motion is put and kept in motion by some other 
thing. It is evident to sense that there are beings in motion. A thing 
is in motion because something else puts and keeps it in motion. That 
mover therefore either is itself in motion or not. If it is not in 
motion, our point is gained which we proposed to prove, namely, that we 
must posit something which moves other things without being itself in 
motion, and this we call God. But if the mover is itself in motion, 
then it is moved by some other mover. Either then we have to go on to 
infinity, or we must come to some mover which is motionless; but it is 
impossible to go on to infinity, therefore we must posit some 
motionless prime mover. In this argument there are two propositions to 
be proved: that everything which is in motion is put and kept in motion 
by something else; and that in the series of movers and things moved it 
is impossible to go on to infinity.<A HREF="gc1_13a.htm">*</a><P>

The Philosopher also goes about in another way to show that it is 
impossible to proceed to infinity in the series of efficient causes, 
but we must come to one first cause, and this we call God. The way is 
more or less as follows. In every series of efficient causes, the first 
term is cause of the intermediate, and the intermediate is cause of the 
last. But if in efficient causes there is a process to infinity, none 
of the causes will be the first: therefore all the others will be taken 
away which are intermediate. But that is manifestly not the case; 
therefore we must posit the existence of some first efficient cause, 
which is God.<A HREF="gc1_13b.htm">*</a><P>

Another argument is brought by St John Damascene (<i>De Fid. 
Orthod.</i> I, 3), thus: It is impossible for things contrary and 
discordant to fall into one harmonious order always or for the most 
part, except under some one guidance, assigning to each and all a 
tendency to a fixed end. But in the world we see things of different 
natures falling into harmonious order, not rarely and fortuitously, but 
always or for the most part. Therefore there must be some Power by 
whose providence the world is governed; and that we call God.<A
