This reasoning is not very convincing. Though
God is a simple being in Himself, He is not simple
to us. We do not know Him, as we know a triangle,
or the number two, by one comprehensive apprehension, 
but by an accumulation of partial concepts. It
is not clear that error in one of these concepts spoils
our view of all the rest. There was a hermit in  the
early Church, who believed that God was a being in
human shape. When some one undeceived him, he
went ahout weeping and crying, "They have taken
away my God." In making that complaint the hermit
was mistaken. For all his anthropmorphism, he had
known God as Maker, Lord, Father, Last End; and
in all those capacities God still remained to him.
