Perhaps this celebrated text simply means that there shall be no 
further delay in the coming of the judgement. Time and motion could 
only cease together.<p> 

Science has sometimes dreamt of a final condition of things in which 
the machinery of the universe shall be completely run down, the 
energies of nature so dislocated as no longer to furnish any 
potentiality of organic life, a uniform temperature established 
everywhere, suns cooled, planetary revolutions stopped, the realisation 
in fact of the <b>homou panta chr&ecirc;mata</b>, or universal 
deadlock, which was the Greek notion of a mindless chaos. Things may 
come to this final impasse, or they may not, science cannot tell. But 
there remains God's promise  to <i>re-establish 
(</i><b>anakephalai&ocirc;sasthai</b>, <i>gather up under a new head) 
all things in Christ</i> (Eph. i, 10). "Hence it is said," quotes St 
Thomas: they are the last words of his book: "<i>I saw a new heaven and 
a new earth</i>  (Apoc. xxi, 1): <i>I will create new heavens and a new 
earth; and the things that were before shall not be in memory, neither 
shall they rise into thought; but ye shall be glad and rejoice for 
ever</i> (Isai. lxv, 17, 18)." "So be it," says Aquinas.
