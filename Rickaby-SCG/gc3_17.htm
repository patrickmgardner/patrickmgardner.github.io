<H1>That all Things are ordained to one End, which is God</h1>

The sovereign good, which is God, is the cause of goodness in all good 
things.  He is therefore also the cause of every end being an end, 
since whatever is an end is such inasmuch as it is good.  But that 
whereby another thing has an attribute, has more of that attribute 
itself.<A HREF="gc3_17a.htm">*</a> Therefore God above all things is 
the end of all.<p>

4. In every series of ends the last end must be the end of all the ends 
preceding.  But we find all things arranged in various grades of 
goodness under our sovereign good, which is the cause of all goodness; 
and thereby, since good bears the character of an end, all things are 
ordered under God as ends preceding under their last end.<p>

5. Private good is subordinated to the end of the common good: for the 
being of a part is for the sake of the being of the whole: hence the 
good of the race is more godlike than the good of the individual man. 
But the sovereign good, which is God, is the common good, since the 
good of the whole community depends on Him: while the goodness which 
marks any given thing is its own private good, and also the good of 
other things which depend upon it.  All things therefore are 
subordinate to the end of one good, which is God.<p>

7. The last end of every producer, in so far as he is a producer, is 
himself: for the things produced by us we use for ourselves; and if 
ever a man makes anything for another man, that is referred to his own 
good, -- his utility, his pleasure, or his honour.  But God is the 
productive cause of all things, either immediately or mediately.  And 
therefore He is the end of all.<p>

Hence it is said: <i>God hath wrought all things for himself</i> (Prov. 
xvi, 4): and, <i>I am alpha and omega, the first and the last</i> 
(Apoc. xxii, 13).
