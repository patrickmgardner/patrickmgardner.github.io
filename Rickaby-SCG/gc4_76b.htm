<i>Pallis</i>. The <i>palla</i> now is a small square of linen used to 
cover the chalice. But in St Thomas's time the <i>palla</i> was what is 
now called <i>corporale</i>, the linen cloth on which the consecrated 
elements are laid. The ends of it used to be turned up so as to cover 
the chalice. Both <i>corporale</i> and <i>palla</i> are now blessed by 
a simple priest with the bishop's leave.<p>
