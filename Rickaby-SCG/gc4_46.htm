<H1>That Christ was conceived by the Holy Ghost</h1>

THOUGH every divine activity, whereby anything is done in creatures, is 
common to the entire Trinity, nevertheless the formation of the body of 
Christ is appropriately attributed to the Holy Ghost: for in Scripture 
every grace is wont to be attributed to the Holy Ghost, since what is 
given gratuitously is reckoned to be bestowed out of the love of the 
giver;<A HREF="gc4_46a.htm">*</a> and there is no greater grace 
bestowed on man than his coming to be united with God in union of 
person.<A HREF="gc4_46b.htm">*</a> Still the Holy Ghost cannot be 
called the father of Christ in His human generation; because the Holy 
Ghost did not produce the human nature of Christ out of His own 
substance, but merely by an exertion of His power.
