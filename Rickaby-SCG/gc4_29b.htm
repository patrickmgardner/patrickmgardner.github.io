The term <i>likeness</i>, and its synonym <i>figure</i>, should be 
pressed more home, as in the original it is evidently emphatic. The 
meaning will be clear, if we consider the gist of the whole passage, 
Phil. ii, 3-11. The Philippians are not to be contentious or 
vainglorious, but in humility they are to give way to one another, and 
abate their pretensions to personal distinction: this on the example of 
their Lord, who being God and man, did not think the glory of the 
Godhead, as extended to His human nature, a thing to be <i>seized upon 
without paying a price for it</i> (<b>harpogmon</b>, R.V. 
<i>prize</i>), but submitted to <i>kenosis</i> in His human nature, 
being made <i>in the likeness of ordinary men</i>, and in the 
configuration and general circumstances of His humanity being found 
<i>just like any other man</i>. This He did <i>in the days of his 
flesh</i>, i.e., His mortal life, from birth to crucifixion: cf. Heb. 
v, 7-10, which is a parallel passage to this. It is to be borne in mind 
that, as God, Jesus Christ had a right to a glorified humanity from the 
first: but He waived that right, and went without the glory of His 
body, until He had purchased His glorification by His death. In this 
consisted His <i>kenosis</i>, a voluntary human act of self-abasement 
and self-renunciation on His part. This <i>kenosis</i> met with its 
great reward in the glory of His resurrection, in the triumph of His 
ascension, and in the divine honours rendered Him age by age in His 
Church.
