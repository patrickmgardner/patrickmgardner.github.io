<H1>Of Predestination, Reprobation, and Divine Election</h1>

SINCE it has been shown that by the action of God some are guided to 
their last end with the aid of grace, while others, bereft of that same 
aid of grace, fall away from their last end; and at the same time all 
things that are done by God are from eternity foreseen and ordained by 
His wisdom, as has also been shown, it needs must be that the aforesaid 
distinction of men has been from eternity ordained of God. Inasmuch 
therefore as He has from eternity pre-ordained some to be guided to the 
last end, He is said to have 'predestined' them. Hence the Apostle 
says: <i>Who hath predestined us to the adoption of sons, according to 
the purpose of his will</i> (Eph. i, 5). But those to whom from 
eternity He has arranged not to give grace,<A HREF="gc3_164a.htm">*</a> 
He is said to have 'reprobated,' or 'hated,' according to the text: 
<i>I have loved Jacob, and hated Esau</i> (Malach. i, 2). In point of 
this distinction, inasmuch as some He has reprobated and some He has 
predestined, we speak of the divine 'election,' of which it is said: 
<i>He hath elected us in him before the constitution of the world</i> 
(Eph. i, 4). Thus it appears that predestination and election and 
reprobation is a part of divine providence, according as by the said 
providence men are guided to their last end. And it may be shown that 
predestination and election do not induce necessity, by the same 
arguments whereby it was shown that divine providence does not take 
away contingency from creation (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_72.htm">LXXII</a>).<p> 

But that predestination and election have no cause in any human merits 
may be shown, not only by the fact that the grace of God, an effect of 
predestination, is not preceded by any merits, but precedes all merit, 
but also by this further fact, that the divine will and providence is 
the first cause of all things that are made. Nothing can be cause of 
the will and providence of God; although of the effects of providence, 
and of the effects of predestination, one effect may be cause of 
another.<A HREF="gc3_164b.htm">*</a> For <i>who hath first given to 
him, and recompense shall be made him? For if him and by him and in him 
are all things: to him be glory forever, Amen</i> (Rom. xi, 35, 36).
