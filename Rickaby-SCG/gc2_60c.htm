Upon careful study of this chapter, it appears that there is little in 
the above statement which St Thomas really disagrees with. He makes his 
own all the description of the 'passive intellect.' Only the conclusion 
he finds fault with; and to mark what he holds objectionable, I have 
printed it in italics. Habits of knowledge he would place in the 
'potential intellect.' The passive intellect is and must be exercised 
in the acquirement of knowledge to prepare the materials: but it can do 
no more than prepare: the intellectual assimilation of those materials 
belongs to a higher power, to intellect proper.
