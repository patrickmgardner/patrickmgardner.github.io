<H1>That by the Divine Law we are directed to the Love of our 
Neighbour</h1>

THERE should be a union of affection among those who have one common 
end:<A HREF="gc3_117a.htm">*</a> but men share in the one common last 
end of happiness, to which they are ordained of God; and therefore they 
should be united in mutual love.<p> 

2. Whoever loves another, must in consequence also love those whom that 
other loves and who are united with him.<A HREF="gc3_117b.htm">*</a>  
But men are loved by God, seeing that for them He has prepared the 
enjoyment of Himself as their last end. Therefore as one is a lover of 
God, so must he also be a lover of his neighbour.<p> 

3. Since man is naturally a social animal, he needs to be helped by 
other men to gain his proper end; and this is most aptly done by mutual 
love prevailing amongst men.<p> 

4. To attend to divine things, a man needs tranquillity and peace. Now 
the things that might trouble peace are most effectually taken away by 
mutual love. Since then the law of God orders men to attend to divine 
things, mutual love amongst men must necessarily be a provision of the 
divine law.<p> 

5. The divine law is given to man to bear out the natural law.<A 
HREF="gc3_117c.htm">*</a> But it is natural to all men to love one 
another: a sign of this is the fact that by a sort of natural instinct 
man helps any man, even a stranger, in necessity, as by calling him 
back from a wrong turn that he may have taken on his way, lifting him 
up from a fall, and the like, as though every man were kinsman and 
friend of every other man.<p>

Hence it is said: <i>This is my commandment, that ye love one 
another</i> (John xv, 12): <i>This commandment we have of God, that he 
who loveth God do love also his brother</i> (1 John iv, 21): <i>The 
second commandment is, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</i> 
(Matt. xxii, 39).
