<H1>That Creation is not a Movement nor a Change</h1>

Every movement or change is the actualisation of something that was in 
potentiality, as such: but in this action of creation there is nothing 
pre-existent in potentiality to become the object of the action.<p> 

2. The extremes of movement or change fall under the same order,<A 
HREF="gc2_17a.htm">*</a> being either of the same kind, as contraries 
are, or sharing one common potentiality of matter. But nothing of this 
can be in creation, to which no previous condition of things is 
supposed.<p> 

3. In every change or movement there must be something coming to be 
otherwise than as it was before. But where the whole substance of a 
thing is brought into being, there cannot be any permanent residuum, 
now in this condition, now in that: because such a residuum would not 
be produced, but presupposed to production.<p>
