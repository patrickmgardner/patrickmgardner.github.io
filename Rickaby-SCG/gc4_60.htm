<h1>Of Confirmation</h1>

THE perfection of spiritual strength consists in a man's daring to 
confess the faith of Christ before any persons whatsoever, undeterred 
by any shame or intimidation. This Sacrament then, whereby spiritual 
strength is conferred on the regenerate man, constitutes him a champion 
of the faith of Christ. And because those who fight under a Prince wear 
his badge, persons confirmed are signed with the sign of Christ, 
whereby He fought and conquered. They receive this sign on their 
foreheads, to signify that they do not blush publicly to confess the 
faith of Christ. The signing is done with a composition of oil and 
balsam, called 'chrism,' not unreasonably. By the oil is denoted the 
power of the Holy Ghost, whereby Christ is termed 'anointed' [Acts ii, 
36: x, 38] and from Christ [<b>christos</b>, anointed] 'Christians' 
have their name, as soldiers serving under Him. In the balsam, for its 
fragrance, the good name is shown, which they who live among worldly 
people should have, to enable them publicly to confess the name of 
Christ, to which end they are brought forth from the remote confines of 
the Church to the field of battle.<A HREF="gc4_60a.htm">*</a> 
Appropriately too is this Sacrament conferred by bishops only, who are 
the generals of the Christian army: for in secular warfare it belongs 
to the general to enroll soldiers:<A HREF="gc4_60b.htm">*</a> thus the 
recipients of this Sacrament are enrolled in a spiritual warfare, and 
the bishop's hand is imposed over them to denote the derivation of 
power from Christ.
