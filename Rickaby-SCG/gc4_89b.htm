Adopting for this verse 51 the reading of the
Vatican manuscript, <b>pantes sou koim&ecirc;sometha, pantes
de allag&ecirc;sometha</b>, I have been led to take a different
view of this chapter. "The whole chapter is written
on the theme of the resurrection of the just: the
wicked are nowhere considered" (<i>Notes on St Paul</i>
pp. 131 sq.; cf pp. 378, 381, on Romans viii, 21-39). 
It is St Paul's manner at times to prescind from
the wicked, and treat of the destiny of the normal
Christian; or, as St Thomas would put it, to tell us
of what is <i>per se</i>, and omit what is <i>per accidens</i>. 
St Thomas himself, in this very chapter, takes 1 Cor.
xv, 44, to refer only to the resurrection of the just.
Elsewhere however, on the solemn occasion of his
trial before Felix, St Paul bears witness to the 
resurrection of the wicked: <i>Having hope in God that there is
to be resurrection of the dead, both just and unjust</i> (Acts
xxiv, 15).
