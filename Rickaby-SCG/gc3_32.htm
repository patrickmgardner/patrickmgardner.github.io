<H1>That Happiness does not consist in the Goods of the Body</h1>

THE soul is better than the body. Therefore the good of the soul, as
understanding and the like, is better than the good of the body. The
good of the body therefore is not the highest good of man.<p>

3. These goods are common to man and other animals: but happiness is
the proper good of man alone.<p>

4. For goods of the body, many animals are better off than man: some 
are swifter, some are stronger, and so of the rest. If in these things 
the highest good consisted, man would not be the most excellent of 
animals.
