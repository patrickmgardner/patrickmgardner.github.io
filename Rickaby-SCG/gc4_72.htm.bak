<h1>Of the need of the Sacrament of Penance, and of the Parts 
thereof</h1>

THE Sacrament of Penance is a spiritual cure. As sick men are healed, 
not by being born again, but by some reaction (<i>alteratio</i>) set up 
in their system; so, of sins committed after baptism, men are healed by 
the spiritual reaction of Penance, not by repetition of the spiritual 
regeneration of Baptism. Now a bodily cure is sometimes worked entirely 
from within by the mere effort of nature; sometimes from within and 
from without at the same time, when nature is aided by the benefit of 
medicine. But the cure is never wrought entirely from without: there 
still remain in the patient certain elements of life, which go to cause 
health in him.<A HREF="gc4_72a.htm">*</a> A spiritual cure cannot 
possibly be altogether from within, for man cannot be set free from 
guilt but by the aid of grace (B. III, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_157.htm">CLVII</a>). Nor can such a cure be altogether from 
without, for the restoration of mental health involves the setting up 
of orderly motions in the will. Therefore the spiritual restoration, 
effected in the Sacrament of Penance, must be wrought both from within 
and from without. And that happens in this way.<p> 

The first loss that man sustains by sin is a wrong bent given to his 
mind, whereby it is turned away from the unchangeable good, which is 
God, and turned to sin.<A HREF="gc4_72b.htm">*</a> The second is the 
incurred liability to punishment (B. III, Chapp. <A HREF="gc3_141.htm"> 
CXLI</a>-CXLVI). The third is a weakening of natural goodness, 
rendering the soul more prone to sin and more reluctant to do good. The 
first requisite then of the Sacrament of Penance is a right ordering, 
or orientation of mind, turning it to God and away from sin, making it 
grieve for sin committed, and purposing not to commit it in future. All 
these things are of the essence of Contrition. This re-ordering of the 
mind cannot take place without charity, and charity cannot be had 
without grace (B. III, Chap. <A HREF="gc3_151.htm">CLI</a>). Thus then 
Contrition takes away the offence of God, and delivers from the 
liability of eternal punishment, as that liability cannot stand with 
grace and charity: for eternal punishment is in separation from God, 
with whom man is united by grace and charity.<A 
HREF="gc4_72c.htm">*</a><p> 

This re-ordering of the mind, which consists in Contrition, comes from 
within, from free will aided by divine grace. But because the merit of 
Christ, suffering for mankind, is the operative principle in the 
expiation of all sins (Chap. <A HREF="gc4_55.htm">LV</a>), a man who 
would be delivered from sin must not only adhere in mind to God, but 
also to the <i>mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus</i> 
(i Tim. ii, 5), in whom is given remission of all sins. For spiritual 
health consists in the turning of the mind and heart to God; which 
health we cannot gain otherwise than through the physician of our souls 
Jesus Christ, who <i>saves his people from their sins</i> (Matt. i, 
21); whose merit is sufficient for the entire taking away of all sins, 
since He it is that <i>taketh away the sins of the world</i> (John i, 
29). Not all penitents however perfectly gain the effect of remission; 
but each one gains it in so much as he is united with Christ suffering 
for sins. Our union with Christ in baptism comes not of any activity of 
our own, as from within, because nothing begets itself into being; it 
is all of Christ, <i>who hath regenerated us unto living hope</i> (i 
Peter i, 3): consequently the remission of sins in baptism is by the 
power of Christ, uniting us to Himself perfectly and entirely; the 
result being that not only is the impurity of sin taken away, but also 
all liability to sin is entirely cancelled, -- always excepting the 
accidental case of those who gain not the effect of the Sacrament, 
because they are not sincere in approaching it.<A 
HREF="gc4_72d.htm">*</a> But in this spiritual cure (the Sacrament of 
Penance), it is our own act, informed with divine grace, that unites us 
with Christ. Hence the effect of remission is not always gained totally 
by this union, nor do all gain it equally. The turning of mind and 
heart to God and to detestation of sin may be so vehement as to gain 
for the penitent a perfect remission of sin, including at once 
purification from guilt and a discharge of the entire debt of 
punishment. But this does not always occur. Sometimes, though the guilt 
is taken away and the debt of eternal punishment cancelled, there still 
remains some obligation of temporal punishment, to save the justice of 
God, which redresses fault by punishment.<p> 

But since the infliction of punishment for fault requires a trial, the 
penitent who has committed himself to Christ for his cure must await 
the judgement of Christ in the assessment of his punishment. This 
judgement Christ exercises through His ministers, as in the other 
Sacraments. No one can give judgement upon faults that he is ignorant 
of. Therefore a second part of this Sacrament is the practice of 
Confession, the object of which is to make the penitent's fault known 
to Christ's minister. The minister then, to whom Confession is made, 
must have judicial power as viceregent of Christ, who <i>is appointed 
judge of the living and of the dead</i> (Acts x, 42). There are two 
requisites of judicial power, authority to investigate the offence, and 
power to acquit (<i>potestas absolvendi</i>) or condemn. This science 
of discerning and this power of binding or loosing are the two keys of 
the Church, which the Lord committed to Peter (Matt. xvi, 19). He is 
not to be understood to have committed them to Peter for Peter to hold 
them alone, but that through him they might be transmitted to others; 
or else the salvation of the faithful would not be sufficiently 
provided for. These keys have their efficacy from the Passion of 
Christ, whereby Christ has opened to us the gate of the heavenly 
kingdom. As then without Baptism, in which the Passion of Christ works, 
there can be no salvation for men, -- whether the Baptism be actually 
received, or purposed in desire, when necessity, not contempt, sets the 
Sacrament aside; so for sinners after Baptism there can be no salvation 
unless they submit themselves to the keys of the Church either by actual 
Confession and undergoing of the judgement of the ministers of the 
Church, or at least by purposing so to do with a purpose to be 
fulfilled in seasonable time: because <i>there is no other name under 
heaven given to men, whereby we are to be saved</i> (Acts iv, 12).<A 
HREF="gc4_72e.htm">*</a><p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of certain persons, who said that a man 
could obtain pardon of his sins without confession and purpose of 
confession; or that the prelates of the Church could dispense a sinner 
from the obligation of confession. The prelates of the Church have no 
power to frustrate the keys of the Church, in which their whole power 
is contained; nor to enable a man to obtain forgiveness of his sins 
without the Sacrament which has its efficacy from the Passion of 
Christ: only Christ, the institutor and author of the Sacraments, can 
do that. The prelates of the Church can no more dispense a man from 
confession and absolution in order to remission of sin than they can 
dispense him from baptism in order to salvation.<p> 

But this is a point to observe. Baptism may be efficacious to the 
remission of sin before it is actually received, while one purposes to 
receive it: though afterwards it takes fuller effect in the gaining of 
grace and the remission of guilt, when it actually is received. And 
sometimes<A HREF="gc4_72f.htm">*</a> the very instant of baptism is the 
instant of the bestowal of grace and the remission of guilt where it 
was not remitted before. So the keys of the Church work their effect in 
some cases before the penitent actually places himself under them, 
provided he have the purpose of placing himself under them. But he 
gains a fuller grace and a fuller remission, when he actually submits 
himself to the keys by confessing and receiving absolution. And the 
case is quite possible (<i>nihil prohibet</i>) of a person at 
confession receiving grace and the forgiveness of the guilt of sin by 
the power of the keys in the very instant of absolution [i.e., not 
before then].<A HREF="gc4_72g.htm">*</a> Since then in the very act of 
confession and absolution a fuller effect of grace and forgiveness is 
conferred on him who by his good purpose had obtained grace and 
remission already, we clearly see that by the power of the keys the 
minister of the Church in absolving remits something of the temporal 
punishment which the penitent still continued to owe after his act of 
contrition. He binds the penitent by his injunction to pay the rest.<A 
HREF="gc4_72h.htm">*</a> The fulfilment of this injunction is called 
Satisfaction, which is the third part of Penance, whereby a man is 
totally discharged from the debt of punishment, provided he pays the 
full penalty dne. Further than this, his weakness in spiritual good is 
cured by his abstaining from evil things and accustoming himself to 
good deeds, subduing the flesh by fasting, and improving his relations 
with his neighbour by the bestowal of alms upon those neighbours from 
whom he had been culpably estranged.<p> 

Thus it is clear that the minister of the Church in the use of the keys 
exercises judicial functions. But to none is judgement committed except 
over persons subject to his court. Hence it is not any and every priest 
that can absolve any and every subject from sin:<A 
HREF="gc4_72i.htm">*</a> priest can absolve that subject only over 
whom he is given authority.
