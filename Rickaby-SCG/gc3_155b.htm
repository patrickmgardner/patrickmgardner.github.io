Not to any men now living, but to the prophets
of the Old Law, with the apostles, and some few other
saints of the New. The great revelation was that
made in Christ (Heb. i, 1), of which the Church is
the guardian and exponent. The Church gets no new
revelations. The Pope has no revelations as Pope: he
takes counsel of theologians: only a special providence,
such as might preserve him, e.g., from drowning, prevents 
his authoritatively teaching the Church any
point of faith or morals that is not a legitimate 
unfolding of the revelation of Christ.
