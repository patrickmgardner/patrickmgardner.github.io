Averroes, and after him St Thomas (II Sent.
d. 17, q. 2, a. 1), attributes this opinion to Avempace 
(Ibn-B&acirc;dja), a Moorish philosopher at Seville
and Granada in the early twelfth century. As making
the potential intellect a corporeal faculty, the opinion
is redolent of Alexander, and is rejected by Averroes.
