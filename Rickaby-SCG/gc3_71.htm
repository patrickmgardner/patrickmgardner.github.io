<H1>That the Divine Providence is not wholly inconsistent with the presence 
of Evil in Creation</h1>

PERFECT goodness could not be in creation if there were not found an 
order of goodness among creatures, some being better than others: or 
else all possible grades of goodness would not be filled up; nor would 
any creature be like God in having pre-eminence over another.<A 
HREF="gc3_71a.htm>*</a> Thus a great beauty would be lost to creation 
in the removal of the order of distinct and dissimilar beings, one 
better than the other. A dead level of goodness would be a manifest 
derogation to the perfection of creation. A higher grade of goodness 
consists in there being something which cannot fall away from goodness; 
a lower grade, in there being that which can fall away.<A 
HREF="gc3_71b.htm>*</a> The perfection of the universe requires both 
grades of goodness. But it is the care of a ruler to uphold perfection 
in the subjects of his government, not to make it less. Therefore it is 
no part of divine providence wholly to exclude from creation the 
capability of falling away from good. But upon this capability evil 
ensues: for what is capable of falling away, sometimes does fall away; 
and the mere lack of good is evil (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_7.htm">VII</a>).<p> 

3. The best rule in any government is to provide for everything under 
government according to the mode of its nature: just administration 
consists in this. As then it would be contrary to any rational plan of 
human administration for the civil government to debar its subjects 
from acting according to their offices and conditions of life, except 
perhaps in an occasional hour of emergency, so it would be contrary to 
the plan of divine government not to allow creatures to act according 
to the mode of their several natures. But by the very fact of creatures 
so acting there follows destruction and evil in the world, since by 
reason of mutual contrariety and inconsistency one thing is destructive 
of another.<A HREF="gc3_71c.htm>*</a><p> 

5. There are many good things in creation which would find no place 
there, unless evils were there also. Thus there would be no patience of 
the just, if there were not the malice of persecutors: no room for 
vindictive justice, if there were no offences: and in the physical order 
one thing cannot come to be unless something else is destroyed.<A 
HREF="gc3_71d.htm>*</a> If then evil were wholly excluded from the 
universe by divine providence, the number of good things would be 
proportionally diminished: which ought not to be, because good is more 
vigorous in goodness than evil in badness (<i>virtuosius est bonum in 
bonitate quam in malitia malum</i>), as above shown (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_12.htm">XII</a>).<p> 

6. The good of the whole takes precedence of the good of the part. It 
belongs then to a prudent ruler to neglect some defect of goodness in 
the part for the increase of goodness in the whole, as an architect 
buries the foundation under the earth for the strengthening of the 
whole house. But if evil were removed from certain portions of the 
universe, much perfection would be lost to the universe, the beauty of 
which consists in the orderly blending of things good and evil 
(<i>pulcritudo ex ordinata bonorum et malorum adunatione consurgit</i>), 
while evil things have their origin in the breaking down of good 
things, and still from them good things again take their rise by the 
providence of the ruler, as an interval of silence makes music 
sweet.<p> 

7. Other things, and particularly inferior things, are ordained to the 
end of the good of man. But if there were no evils in the world, much 
good would be lost to man, as well in respect of knowledge, as also in 
respect of desire and love of good: for good is better known in 
contrast with evil; and while evil results come about, we more ardently 
deire good results: as sick men best know what a blessing health is.<p> 

Therefore it is said: <i>Making peace and creating evil</i> (Isai. xlv, 
7): <i>Shall there be evil in the city that the Lord has not done?</i> 
(Amos iii, 6.)<p> 

Boethius (<i>De consolatione</i>, Lib. I, prosa 4) introduces a 
philosopher asking the question: 'If there is a God, how comes evil?'. 
The argument should be turned the other way: 'If there is evil, there 
is a God.' For there would be no evil, if the order of goodness were 
taken away, the privation of which is evil; and this order would not 
be, if God were not.<p> 

Hereby is taken away the occasion of the error of the Manicheans, who
supposed two primary agents, good and evil, as though evil could not have
place under the providence of a good God.<p>

We have also the solution of a doubt raised by some, whether evil 
actions are of God. Since it has been shown (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_66.htm">LXVI</a>) that every agent produces its action 
inasmuch as it acts by divine power, and that thereby God is the cause 
of all effects and of all actions (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_67.htm">LXVII</a>); and since it has been further shown 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc3_10.htm">X</a>) that in things subject to divine 
providence evil and deficiency happens from some condition of secondary 
causes, in which there may be defect; it is clear that evil actions, 
inasmuch as they are defective, are not of God, but of defective 
proximate causes; but so far as the action and entity contained in them 
goes, they must be of God, -- as lameness is of motive power, so far as 
it has anything of motion, but so far as it has anything of defect, it 
comes of curvature of the leg. <p>
