<i>Liberum de ratione judicium.  Ratio</i>, as often in St Thomas, is 
<i>ratio formalis,</i> or <A HREF="gc1_53a1.htm"><b>logos</b></a>, the 
<i>specific notion</i> rather than the <i>object of the specific 
notion,</i> which is also the object of definition.  So immediately 
above, <i>sub ratione boni</i>.  I need hardly add that every specific 
notion is also a general concept.  Not until intellect has 
universalised the object of choice and viewed it as a generality, is 
the will free.
