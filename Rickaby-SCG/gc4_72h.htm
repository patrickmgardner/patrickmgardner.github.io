It is not the present practice for the confessor regularly to impose a 
penance such as he reckons adequate to all the debt of temporal 
punishment still owing for the sins confessed. Penances comparatively 
light and easy are imposed for grievous sins: for the rest, the 
penitent is left to his own penitential efforts, to the gaining of 
indulgences, and to the justice of God. When <i>confessarius primus</i> 
has imposed a penance smacking of the old canonical rigour, 
<i>confessarius secundus</i> finds next time that the penance has not 
been performed, nor is going to be.
