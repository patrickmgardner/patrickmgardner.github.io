But a 'natural cause,' or physical agent, as such
(<i>res naturalis</i>), as distinguished from a moral agent,
does always act in the same way <i>under the same circumstances</i>. 
It is the circumstances that vary, not the
behaviour of the natural cause. Compare Newton's
second law of motion. And so natural, or physical,
events come about under an hypothetical necessity.
They always happen in the same way, if the antecedents, 
positive and negative, are the same.<p>

In this chapter St Thomas is concerned to obviate
a difficulty unlikely to occur to modern minds, --
how it is consistent with divine providence for 
terrestrial events, such as the weather, the growth of
the crops, the healthy development of animals, not
to run in regular calculable cycles, like the ordinary
celestial phenomena, sunrise and sunset, equinox and
solstice, the waxing and waning of the moon. From
Plato and Aristotle to Newton, celestial phenomena
were 'necessary,' terrestrial 'contingent.' The real
difference is one of simplicity and plurality of causes.
Professor Stewart, <i>Notes on Nicomachean Ethics</i>,
vol. II, p. 9, writes: "There is no contingency in
things, but there is often failure on the part of
organic beings to cope with the complexity of the
necessary laws which thing obey": a remark which
is true, so far as things do obey necessary laws. But
there is a contingency in acts of free will, and in
things so far as they are consequent upon such acts.
To take another point of view. Contingency, like
chance, has been predicated of co-existences, or 
coincidences, rather than of sequences; and necessity
has been made out for sequence better than for 
co-existence. The study of co-existences carries us far
back into the dim past, even to that 'primitive
collocation of materials,' which, it is argued, must
have been the work of intelligence and free will.
