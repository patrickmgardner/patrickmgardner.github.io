'Nothing operates where it is not,' is the rejection of <i>actio in 
distans</i>. The axiom has been disputed, especially since the 
discovery of the law of gravitation. Presence has been distinguished 
into 'local' and 'virtual'; a distinction coming near to that conveyed 
by the two Latin verbs, <i>adsum</i> and <i>intersum</i>. Presence 
indeed is not easy to define. Does presence belong to the term 
<i>whence</i> action comes, or to the term <i>whither</i> it goes, or 
to both? e.g., is the sun in any sense present on the earth? The mind 
is present in the body: is it not present too, although with a 
different presence; in the fixed stars, when it thinks about them? The 
presence of God, as St Thomas well lays down (B. III, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_68.htm">LXVIII</a>), is best defined by His action. 'Where 
God acts, God is': that statement of the axiom is sufficient for the 
argument in this case.
