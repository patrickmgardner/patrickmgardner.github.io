This reads like an early version of the saying,
<i>Man proposes, but God disposes</i>, interpreted to mean
that man's proposing is not of God. We must 
remember that man is upheld by God in action as he
is upheld by God in existence: that <i>esse, posse, agere</i>
in man are all of God. Sin is a certain defect of
action, a lack of proportion, of order, or opportuneness. 
But on its physical side sin is not evil, and as a
physical thing it is wrought by God and man jointly,
like any other action.
