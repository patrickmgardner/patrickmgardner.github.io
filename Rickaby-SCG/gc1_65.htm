<H1>That God Knows Individual Things</h1>

GOD knows things in so far as He is the cause of them. But the 
substantial effects of divine causation are individual things, 
universals not being substantial things, but having being only in 
individuals.<P>

2. Since God's cognitive act is His essence, He must know all that is 
in any way in His essence; and as this essence is the first and 
universal principle of being and the prime origin of all, it virtually 
contains in itself all things that in any way whatsoever have being.<P>

5. In the gradation of faculties it is commonly found that the higher 
faculty extends to more terms, and yet is one; while the range of the 
lower faculty extends to fewer terms, and even over them it is 
multiplied, as we see in the case of imagination and sense, for the 
single power of the imagination extends to all that the five senses 
take cognisance of, and to more.  But the cognitive faculty in God is 
higher than in man: whatever therefore man knows by the various 
faculties of understanding, imagination and sense, God is cognisant of 
by His one simple intuition.  God therefore is apt to know the 
individual things that we grasp by sense and imagination.<P>

6. The divine mind, unlike ours, does not gather its knowledge from 
things, but rather by its knowledge is the cause of things; and thus 
its knowledge of things is a practical knowledge. But practical 
knowledge is not perfect unless it descends to individual cases: for 
the end of practical knowledge is work, which is done on individuals. 
<P> 

9. As the Philosopher argues against Empedocles, God would be very 
wanting in wisdom, if He did not know individual instances, which even 
men know.<P>

This truth is established also by the authority of Holy Scripture, for 
it is said: <i>There is no creature invisible in his sight</i>: also 
the contrary error is excluded by the text: <i>Say not, I shall be 
hidden from God; and from the height of heaven who shall mind me?</i> 
(Ecclus xvi, 16).<P> 

From what has been said it is evident how the objection to the contrary 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc1_63.htm">LXIII</a>, i) is inconclusive: for though 
the mental presentation whereby divine understanding understands is 
immaterial, it is still a type both of matter and form, as being the 
prime productive principle of both.
