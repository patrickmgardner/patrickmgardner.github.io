<H1>That the Variety of Creatures has not arisen from Variety of 
Merits and Demerits</h1>

ORIGEN in his book <b>Peri Arch&ocirc;n</b> says that God out of mere bounty 
in His  first production of creatures made them all equal, all 
spiritual and rational, and they by free will behaved in various ways, 
some adhering to God more or less, and others receding from Him more or 
less; and thus by order of divine justice various grades ensued among 
spiritual substances, some appearing as angels of various orders, some 
as human souls also of various states and conditions, some again as 
demons in various states. He also said that it was through this variety 
of rational creatures that God instituted a variety also of material 
creatures, so that the nobler spiritual substances should be united to 
the nobler bodies, and that in divers other ways the material creation 
might serve to express the variety of spiritual substances. According 
to Origen, man, sun, and stars are composed of rational substances 
united with corresponding bodies. Now all this opinion can be shown to 
be manifestly false.<p>

1. The better a thing is, the higher place does it hold in the 
intention of the agent who produces it. But the best thing in creation 
is the perfection of the universe, which consists in the orderly 
variety of things:<A HREF="gc2_44a.htm">*</a> for in all things the 
perfection of the whole is preferable to the perfection of parts and 
details. Therefore the diversity of creatures does not arise from 
diversity of merits, but was primarily intended by the prime agent.<p>

2. If all rational creatures were created equal from the beginning, we 
should have to allow that they do not depend for their activity one on 
another. What arises by the concurrence of divers causes working 
independently of one another is matter of chance; and thus the 
diversity and order of creation comes by chance, which is impossible.<A 
HREF="gc2_44b.htm">*</a><p>

12. Since a spiritual creature, or angel, does not deserve to be 
degraded except for sin, -- and it is degraded from its high, invisible 
estate, by being united with a visible body, -- it seems that visible 
bodies have been added to these spiritual creatures because of sin; 
which comes near to the error of the Manicheans, who laid it down that 
the visible creation proceeded from an evil principle.  Origen seems 
not to have given sufficient weight to the consideration that, when we 
give, not in discharge of any debt, but out of liberality, it is not 
contrary to justice if we give in unequal measure: but God brought 
things into being under no debt, but of sheer liberality (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_28.htm">XXVIII</a>): therefore the variety of creatures does 
not presuppose variety of merits.<p>
