If an ear mistakes a sound or the eye a colour, the aurist, or 
the oculist, at once infers that the organ is unhealthy; as sound 
is the "proper object" of hearing, and colour of sight.  But a 
mistake about the direction of a sound, or the distance of a 
hill, shows, not an unhealthy, but an untrained ear or eye; as 
direction and distance are "accidental objects" of hearing and 
sight. In like manner the understanding in health, or the normal 
understanding, never errs when it says, 'Here's something': this 
is the cognition of "abstract being," the "proper object " of the 
understanding.
