It would be superfluous to translate this chapter. 
The one point of interest which it contains is
the enumeration of wonders ascribed to magicians in
the thirteenth century. Such wonders are answers
given about the whereabouts of things stolen, about
buried treasures, about future events, also about
points of science: speaking apparitions: statues that
move and speak: locks opening on a person's mere
approach: people becoming invisible. St Thomas
writes: "If any one says that such apparitions are
not in the external sense but are simply imaginary,
that explanation has its difficulties: for no one takes
imaginary forms for true ones except in cases of
alienation of the mind from exterior impressions:
only when the natural judgement of sense is impaired 
can phantoms be attended to as though they
were realities: but these conversations and apparitions 
occur to men who have the full use of their
external senses." He mentions "statues made by the
necromantic art," but does not explicitly refer to
that evocation of the spirits of the departed, which
is the pretence of modern spiritualism.<p>
