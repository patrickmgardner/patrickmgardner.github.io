<H1>That nothing can be a Cause to the Divine Will</h1>

THOUGH some reason may be assigned for the divine will, yet it does not 
follow that there is any cause of that will's volition. For the cause 
of volition is the end in view: now the end in view of the divine will 
is its own goodness: that then is God's cause of willing, which is also 
His own act of willing. But of other objects willed by God none is to 
God a cause of willing, but one of them is cause to another of its 
being referred to the divine goodness, and thus God is understood to 
will one for the sake of another. But clearly we must suppose no 
passing from point to point of God's will, where there is only one act, 
as shown above of the divine intellect (Chap. <a 
href="gc1_57.htm">LVII</a>). For God by one act wills His own goodness 
and all other things, as His action is His essence. By this and the 
previous chapter the error is excluded of some who say that all things 
proceed from God by sheer will, so that no reason is to be rendered of 
anything that He does beyond the fact that God so wills. Which position 
is even contrary to divine Scripture, which tells us that God has done 
all things according to the order of His wisdom: <i>Thou hast done all 
things in wisdom</i> (Ps. ciii, 24) ; and <i>God has shed wisdom over 
all his works</i> (Ecclus i,10).
