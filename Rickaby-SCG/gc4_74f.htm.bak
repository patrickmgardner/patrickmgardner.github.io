The deniers of the Objective Presence deny that
there is any sacramental union where, owing to sin,
there is no spiritual union. According to them, Christ
is not except where He is received with faith and love;
and an unworthy Communion is no Communion at
all. In the theology of the Catholic Church, the one
Sacrament which is invalidated by an illicit reception
is the Sacrament of Penance, of which the acts of the
penitent are a constituent part.<p>
