For Scripture authority St Thomas might have
quoted: <i>The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory
above the heavens</i> (Ps. CXII). God's free will is 
contained in His real physical distinctness from the 
universe, His sovereign pre-eminence over it, and absolute
independence of it.  Identify God with the universe,
and logically He is no longer free. Pushed to 
extremity, Idealism means Pantheism, and Pantheism
Determinism. For if God has no free will, still less
has man.
