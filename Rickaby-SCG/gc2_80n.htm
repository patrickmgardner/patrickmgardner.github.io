'Phantasm' here cannot be taken to mean a consciously portrayed picture 
in the imagination. Reading a book, or writing a letter, would be very 
low work, if every act of understanding had to be thus sensibly 
illustrated. The use of what may be called the algebra of language ` 
is to deliver us from the necessity of all this actual delineation. 
And this raises the question: 'Do departed souls carry their knowledge 
of language with them?' It is hard to determine such questions <i>a 
priori</i>.
