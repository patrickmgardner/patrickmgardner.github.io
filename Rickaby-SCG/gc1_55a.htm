There is no idealism in this statement.  See
Aristotle, <i>De Anima</i>, iii, 8. The act of understanding
consists in forming in the mind an image of the thing
understood. The mind in understanding becomes an
image, and the object in being understood becomes that
same image.  So St Thomas explains in the opening of
Chapter <A HREF="gc1_53.htm">LIII</a>.
