The second of the Newtonian laws of motion warns us that all physical 
tendencies to motion work themselves out concurrently and 
instantaneously <i>as tendencies</i>. St Thomas's reasoning however is 
beset with this difficulty, that, parted from the body, the soul, on 
his showing, still retains a physical tendency to union with the body: 
is there any more difficulty, anything of greater violence, in a soul 
having to wait for its first union with the body than in its having to 
wait, as it certainly does wait for centuries, for its reunion in the 
resurrection?<p> 

The two telling arguments against the pre-existence of souls are, 
first, that <i>pace Platonis et Origenis</i> it is wholly unproved; 
secondly, that a spirit, that had once existed free, would suffer 
violence by becoming the 'form' of a body under conditions of 
mortality.<p> 

There are those who venture to think, although St Thomas does not think 
so, that while the soul in the body is properly called an 'incomplete 
substance,' -- for otherwise it would not be the 'form of the body,' -- 
yet, parted from the body, it expands into the completeness of pure 
intelligence, and has no 'natural craving' for union with the body any 
more. Resurrection then is not within the purview of philosophy, as it 
is not the fulfilment of any natural exigence; and, at least in the 
resurrection of the just, the soul shall be in the body on quite other 
conditions than those under which she now dwells in this prison-house of 
flesh. But of this in the fourth Book.
