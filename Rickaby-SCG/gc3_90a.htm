Aristotle, <i>Eth. Nic.</i> X, ix, 13: "If; as is 
commonly supposed, the gods have any care of men, we
may well believe them to take delight in that which
is best and most akin to themselves: . . . . the 
intellectual worker then will be best loved of heaven."
This is not Christianity, but may be turned that way.
