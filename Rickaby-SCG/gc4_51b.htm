All this would be clearer if Averroes's theory
were tenable, of one common human mind, or soul,
one common psychic stock, as it were, sprouting out
into various branches, or personalities, something
like an aquatic plant, with many heads showing
above water, and these distinct, but all meeting in
one root under water. Then we might argue that
the common stock remained infected with original
sin, though individuals were cleansed. The theory
is, I suppose, utterly untenable; or, if there is any
truth in it, it is a truth that no man hitherto
has been able to formulate without grave and
dangerous error. We cannot impute such a notion to
the great opponent of Averroism. But St Thomas's
distinction between nature and person in this 
connexion would be plainer, and his whole argument
more telling, on Averroistic principles. See his own
remark on Averroism in Chap. XLI.
