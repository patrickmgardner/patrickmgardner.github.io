<H1>That Happiness does not consist in any Act of the Will<A 
HREF="gc3_26a.htm">*</a></h1>

SINCE a subsistent intelligence in its activity arrives at God, not by 
understanding alone, but also by an act of the will desiring and loving 
Him and taking delight in Him, some one may think that the last end and 
final felicity of man is not in knowing God, but rather in loving Him, 
or exercising some other act of the will upon Him; especially seeing 
that the object of the will is good, which bears the character of an 
end, whereas truth, which is the object of the intellect, does not bear 
the character of an end except in so far as it (<i>ipsum</i>) too is 
good. Hence it seems that man does not attain his last end by an act of 
intellect, but rather by an act of will. But this position is 
manifestly proved to be untenable.<p> 

1. Happiness, being the peculiar good of an intelligent nature, must 
attach to the intelligent nature on the side of something that is 
peculiar to it. But appetite is not peculiar to intelligent nature, but 
is found in all things, though diversely in diverse beings: which 
diversity however arises from the different ways in which they stand to 
consciousness. Things wholly devoid of consciousness have only natural 
appetite, or physical tendency. Things that have sensitive 
consciousness have sensible appetite, under which the irascible and 
concupiscible are included. Things that have intellectual consciousness 
have an appetite proportionate to that consciousness, namely, the will. 
The will therefore, as being an appetite, is not a peculiar 
appurtenance of an intelligent nature, except so far as it is dependent 
on the intelligence: but intelligence in itself is peculiar to an 
intelligent nature. Happiness therefore consists in an act of the 
intellect substantially and principally rather than in an act of the 
will.<p> 

2. In all powers that are moved by their objects the objects are 
naturally prior to the acts of those powers. But such a power is the 
will, for the desirable object moves desire. The object therefore of 
the will is naturally prior to the act. The prime object of will then 
precedes every act of will. No act of will therefore can be the prime 
object of volition. But the prime object of will is the last end, which 
is happiness. Happiness therefore cannot possibly be itself an act of 
will.<p> 

3. In all powers that can reflect on their own acts, the act of that 
power must first fix on some object, and then fix on its own act. For 
if the intellect understands that it understands, we must suppose that 
it first understands some thing, and afterwards understands its own 
understanding of that thing: for the act of understanding, which the 
intellect understands, means the understanding of some object. Hence we 
must either proceed to infinity; or, coming to some first object of 
understanding, this object, we must say, will not be a sheer act of 
understanding, but some intelligible thing. Similarly the first object 
of will cannot be any sheer act of willing, but some other good. But 
the first object of will to an intelligent nature is happiness: for it 
is for the sake of happiness that we will whatever we do will. 
Happiness therefore cannot possibly consist essentially in any act of 
will.<p> 

4. Everything has the truth of its nature by having the constituents of 
its substance: for a real man differs from a painted one by the 
constituents of the substance of man. But true happiness does not 
differ from false happiness in respect of the act of will: for the will 
is in the same attitude of desire, or love, or delight, whatever the 
object proposed to it for its sovereign good, true or false: but 
whether the object so proposed be the true sovereign good or a 
counterfeit, that difference is decided by intellect. Happiness 
therefore consists essentially in intellect rather than in any act of 
will.<p> 

5. If any act of will were happiness itself, that act would be either 
desire or love or delight. Now it is impossible for desire to be the 
last end: for desire obtains inasmuch as the will tends to something 
which it has not yet got: but such straining after the absent is 
inconsistent with the idea of an achieved last end. Love again cannot 
be the last end: for good is loved not only in its presence but also in 
its absence: for it is from love that good not possessed is sought for 
by desire. And though the love of good already attained is more 
perfect, that access of perfection is to be ascribed to the attainment 
and established possession of the good loved. The attainment of good 
then, which is the end, is a different thing from the love of good, 
which love is imperfect before attainment, and perfect after attainment. 
In like manner neither is delight the last end: for the very possession 
of good is the cause of delight, while we either feel the good now 
possessed, or remember the good possessed before, or hope for the good 
to be possessed in future: delight therefore is not the last end. No 
act of will therefore can be the substance of happiness.<p> 

6. If delight were the last end, it would be desirable of itself. But 
that is false: for it makes a difference what delight is desired, 
considering the object from which delight ensues: for the delight which 
follows upon good and desirable activities is good and desirable: but 
that which follows upon evil activities is evil and to be shunned. 
Delight therefore has its goodness and desirability from something 
beyond itself. Therefore it is not itself the final end, happiness.<p> 

7. The right order of things coincides with the order of nature, for 
natural things are ordained to their end without mistakes. But in 
natural things delight is for activity, and not the other way about: 
for we see that nature has attached delight to those activities of 
animals which are manifestly ordained to necessary ends, as in the use 
of food, which is ordained to the preservation of the individual, and 
in the intercourse of the sexes, which is ordained to the preservation 
of the species: for if delight were not in attendance, animals would 
abstain from the aforesaid necessary acts. It is impossible therefore 
for delight to be the final end.<p> 

8. Delight seems to be nothing else than a rest of the will in some 
befitting good, as desire is an inclination of the will to the gaining 
of some good. Now it is ridiculous to say that the end of movement is 
not the coming to be in one's proper place, but the satisfaction of the 
inclination whereby one tended to go there. If the principle aim of 
nature were the satisfaction of the inclination, it would never give 
the inclination. It gives the inclination, that thereby one may tend to 
one's proper place: when that end is gained, there follows the 
satisfaction of the inclination: thus the satisfaction of the 
inclination is not the end, but a concomitant of the end.<p> 

9. If any exterior thing is to be any one's end, we must assign the 
title of last end to that activity whereby the thing is first gained: 
thus to people who make money their end, the getting of the money is 
the end, not the love or desire of it. But the last end of a subsistent 
intelligence is God. That activity then in man makes the substance of 
his happiness, whereby he first attains to God. But that is the 
activity of understanding: for we cannot will what we do not 
understand. The final happiness of man then substantially consists in 
knowing God by the understanding, and not in any act of the will.<p> 

From what has been said we may solve the objections to the contrary. 
The fact of the sovereign good being the object of the will does not 
necessitate sovereign good being substantially the act of the will 
itself, as was the tenor of the argument first proposed: nay, from the 
fact of its being the first object, it follows that it is not the 
act.<p> 

<i>Arg. 2</i>. The last perfection of activity is delight, which 
perfects activity as beauty does youth.<A HREF="gc3_26b.htm">*</a>  If 
then any perfect activity is the last end, it seems that the last end 
is rather in the activity of the will than of the intellect.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. There are two ways of being a perfection to a thing. In 
one way there is a perfection to a thing already complete in its 
species: in another way there is a perfection going to make up the 
species. Thus the perfection of a house, considered as complete in its 
species, is that use for which the house is intended, namely, being 
inhabited: hence this should be put in the definition of a house, if 
the definition is to be adequate. A perfection going to make up the 
species of a house may be one of the constituents and substantial 
principles of the species: or it may be something that goes to the 
preservation of the species, as the buttresses made to prop the house 
up: lastly, under this head we must count whatever makes the house more 
comely for use, as its beauty. That therefore which is the perfection 
of a thing, considered as already complete in its species, is the end 
of a thing, as being inhabited is the end of a house. And in like 
manner the proper activity of each thing, which is a sort of use of it, 
is the end of the thing. But the perfections which go to make up the 
species are not the end of the thing: rather the thing is their end. 
Thus matter and form are for the species. In like manner the 
perfections that preserve a thing in its species, as health and 
nutrition, though they perfect the animal, are not the end of its 
existence, but rather the other way about. Those perfections also 
whereby a thing is fitted to discharge the proper activities of its 
species and gain its due end more becomingly, are not the end of the 
thing, but rather the other way about, e.g., a man's beauty and bodily 
strength, and other accomplishments, of which the philosopher says that 
they minister to happiness instrumentally.<A HREF="gc3_26c.htm">*</a> 
Now when we say that delight is the perfection of activity, we do not 
mean that activity specifically considered is directed to the purpose 
of delight, -- the fact is, it is ordained to other ends, as eating is 
ordained to the preservation of the individual, -- we mean that delight 
ranks among the perfections which go to make up the species of a thing: 
for through the delight that we take in any action we apply ourselves 
to it more attentively and becomingly.<p>

<i>Arg. 3</i>. Delight seems to be so desired for its own sake as never 
to be desired for the sake of anything else: for it is foolish to ask 
of any one why [he] wishes to be delighted.* But this is the condition 
of the last end, to be desired for its own sake. Therefore the last end 
is rather in an act of the will than of the understanding, so it seems.<p>

<i>Reply</i>. Delight, though it is not the last end, is still a 
concomitant of the last end, since from the attainment of the last end 
delight supervenes.<p>

<i>Arg. 4</i>. In the desire of the last end there is the greatest 
agreement amongst all men, because it is natural. But more seek delight 
than knowledge. Therefore it seems that delight is the end rather than 
knowledge.<p>

<i>Reply</i>. There are not more seekers of the delight that there is 
in knowing than there are seekers of knowledge: but there are more 
seekers after sensible delights than there are seekers of intellectual 
knowledge and the delight thence ensuing; and the reason is because 
external things are more known to the majority of men, as human 
knowledge starts from objects of sense.<p>
 
<i>Arg. 5</i>. The will seems to be a higher power than the 
understanding: for the will moves the understanding to its end: for 
when there is the will so to do, then it is that the understanding 
actually considers the knowledge which it habitually possesses. The 
action therefore of the will seems to be nobler than the action of the 
understanding; and therefore the final end of happiness seems in the 
act of will rather than in the act of understanding.<p>

<i>Reply</i>. It is manifestly false to say that the will is higher 
than the understanding as moving it; for primarily and ordinarily the 
understanding moves the will. The will, as such, is moved by its 
object, which is the good apprehended: but the will moves the 
understanding, we may say, incidentally, inasmuch as the act of 
understanding itself is apprehended as good and so is desired by the 
will. Hence it follows that the understanding actually understands, 
and in this has the start of the will; for never would the will desire 
to understand, unless first the understanding apprehended the act 
of understanding itself as good. And again the will moves the 
understanding to actual activity in the way in which an efficient cause 
is said to move: but the understanding moves the will in the way in 
which a final cause moves, for good understood is the end of the will. 
Now the efficient cause is posterior in motion to the final cause, for 
the efficient cause moves only for the sake of the final cause. Hence 
it appears that, absolutely speaking, the understanding is higher than 
the will, but the will is higher than the understanding accidentally 
and in a qualified sense.
