<H1>That not all Sexual Intercourse is Sin</h1>

THE members of the body being the instruments of the soul, the end of 
every member is the use of it, as in the case of any other instrument. 
But there are members of the body the use of which is for the 
intercourse of the sexes: that therefore is their end. But that which 
is the end of any natural thing cannot be in itself evil, because the 
things of nature are ordinances of divine providence. Therefore the 
intercourse of the sexes cannot be in itself evil.<p> 

3. Natural inclinations are put into things by God, who is the prime 
mover of all. Therefore it is impossible for the natural inclination of 
any species to be directed to an object in itself evil. But in all 
full-grown animals there is a natural inclination to sexual union, 
which union therefore cannot be in itself evil.<p> 

4. That without which something good and excellent cannot be, is not in 
itself evil.<A HREF="gc3_126a.htm">*</a> But the perpetuity of the 
species in animals is not preserved except through generation, which is 
of sexual intercourse.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>She sinneth not, if she marry</i> (1 Cor. vii, 36).<p>

Hereby is excluded the error of those who totally condemn marriage, 
which some do because they believe that temporal things proceed not 
from a good but from an evil principle.<A HREF="gc3_126b.htm">*</a>
