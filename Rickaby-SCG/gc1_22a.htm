That is to say, it is the same thing for God to
be at all and to be exactly what He is.  'Godhead'
and 'this God' are identical. No one possibly could
be God save Him alone who actually is God. In God
the ideal order and the actual order coincide, the
order of thought (essence) and the order of being
(existence).
