The body being the principle of individuation, when that principle is 
taken away, it would seem that nothing is left to differentiate one 
soul from another. St Thomas would reply that the soul is 
individualised, not by the body, but by adaptation to one particular 
body which it animates and informs, which adaptation continues after 
that body is dead and gone. See Chap. <A HREF="gc2_75.htm">LXXV</a>, 
arg. 1, with reply and <A HREF="gc2_75a.htm">note</a>; and in this 
chapter the reply to the second argument.
