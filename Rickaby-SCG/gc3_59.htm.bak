<H1>How they who see the Divine Substance see all things</h1>

SINCE the vision of the divine substance is the final end of every 
subsistent intelligence, and the natural desire of every being is at 
rest when it has attained to its final end, the natural desire of every 
intelligence that sees the divine substance must be perfectly set at 
rest. But it is the mind's natural desire to know the genera and 
species and capabilities of all things and the whole order of the 
universe, as is shown by the zeal of mankind in trying to find out all 
these things.<A HREF="gc3_59a.htm">*</a> Every one therefore of those 
who see the divine substance will know all the above-mentioned 
objects.<p>

2. In this is the difference between sense and intellect, as shown in 
<i>De anima</i>, III, iv, that sense is spoilt or impaired by 
brilliant or intense sensible objects, so that afterwards it is unable 
to appreciate similar objects of lower degree: but intellect, not being 
spoilt or checked by its object, but simply perfected, after 
understanding an object in which there is more to understand, is not 
less but better able to understand other objects which afford less scope 
for understanding. But the highest in the category of intelligible 
beings is the divine substance. When then an understanding is raised by 
divine light to see the substance of God, much more is it perfected by 
the same light to understand all other objects in nature.<p>

4. Though of those who see God one sees Him more perfectly than an 
other, every one nevertheless sees Him with such perfection as to fill 
all his natural capacity, nay, the vision transcends all natural 
capacity (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_52.htm">LII</a>). Every one therefore, 
seeing the divine substance, must know in that substance all things to 
which his natural capacity extends. But the natural capacity of every 
intelligence extends to the knowledge of all genera and species and the 
order of creation. These things therefore every one of those who see God 
will know in the divine substance.<p> 

Hence to Moses asking for a sight of the divine substance the Lord 
replied: <i>I will show thee all good</i> (Exod. xxxiii, 19); and 
Gregory says (<i>Dialogues</i> iv, 33): "What is it that they do not 
know, who know Him who knows all things?"<p> 

But on careful reflection upon what has been said it appears that they 
who see the divine substance in one way know all things, and in one way 
they do not. If by 'all things' is meant whatever belongs to the 
perfection of the universe, the arguments alleged prove that they do 
see all things.<A HREF="gc3_59b.htm">*</a> To the perfection of natural 
being belong specific natures, with their properties and powers: for 
the intention of nature fixes on specific natures: as for individuals, 
they are for the species.<A HREF="gc3_59c.htm">*</a> It belongs then to 
the perfection of a subsistent intelligence, that it should know the 
natures and capabilities and proper accidents of all species. And by 
the knowledge of natural species individuals also existing under these 
species are known by the intelligence that sees God.<A 
HREF="gc3_59d.htm">*</a><p>

But if by 'all things' is meant all things that God knows by seeing His 
essence, no created intelligence sees all things in the substance of 
God, as has been shown above (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_56.htm">LVI</a>).<A 
HREF="gc3_59e.htm">*</a>  This may be verified in various respects. 
First, as regards things that God can do, but neither does nor ever 
means to do. All such things cannot be known without a thorough 
comprehension of His power, which is not possible to any created 
intelligence (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_55.htm">LV</a>). Hence it is said: 
<i>Perchance thou wilt seize upon the footprints of God and perfectly 
discover the Almighty. He is higher than heaven, and what wilt thou do? 
He is deeper than hell, and whence shalt thou know? Longer than the 
earth is his measure, and broader than the sea</i> (Job xi, 7-9). 
Secondly, as regards the plans of things made, no intelligence can know 
them all without comprehending the divine goodness. For the plan of 
every thing made is taken from the end which the maker intends; and the 
end of all things made by God is the divine goodness: the plan 
therefore of things made is the diffusion of the divine goodness in 
creation. To know then all the plans of things made, one would have to 
know all the good things that can come about in creation according to 
the order of the divine wisdom: which would mean comprehending the 
divine goodness and wisdom, a thing that no created intelligence can 
do. Hence it is said: <i>I understood that of all the works of God man 
cannot find out the plan</i> (Eccles. viii, 17). Thirdly, as regards 
things that depend on the mere will of God, as predestination, 
election, justification, and the like, which belong to the 
sanctification of the creature, it is said: <i>The things that are in 
man none knoweth but the spirit of man that is in him: in like manner 
the things that are of God none knoweth but the Spirit of God</i> (1 
Cor. ii, 11).
