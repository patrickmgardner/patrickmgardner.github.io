<H1>Of Miracles</h1>

THINGS that are done occasionally by divine power outside of the usual 
established order of events are commonly called miracles (wonders). We 
wonder when we see an effect and do not know the cause. And because one 
and the same cause is sometimes known to some and unknown to others, it 
happens that of the witnesses of the effect some wonder and some do not 
wonder: thus an astronomer does not wonder at seeing an eclipse of the 
sun, at which a person that is ignorant of astronomy cannot help 
wondering.<A HREF="gc3_101a.htm">*</a> An event is wonderful relatively 
to one man and not to another. The absolutely wonderful is that which 
has a cause absolutely hidden. This then is the meaning of the word 
'miracle,' an event of itself full of wonder, not to this man or that 
man only. Now the cause absolutely hidden to every man is God, inasmuch 
as no man in this life can mentally grasp the essence of God (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_47.htm">XLVII</a>). Those events then are properly to be 
styled miracles, which happen by divine power beyond the order commonly 
observed in nature.<p> 

Of these miracles there are several ranks and orders. Miracles of the 
highest rank are those in which something is done by God that nature 
can never do.<A HREF="gc3_101b.htm">*</a> Miracles of the second rank 
are those in which God does something that nature can do, but not in 
that sequence and connexion. Thus it is a work of nature that an animal 
should live, see and walk: but that it should live after death, see 
after blindness, walk after lameness, these things nature is powerless 
to effect, but God sometimes brings them about miraculously. A 
miracle of the third rank is something done by God, which is usually 
done by the operation of nature, but is done in this case without the 
working of natural principles, as when one is cured by divine power of 
a fever, in itself naturally curable, or when it rains without any 
working of the elements.<A HREF="gc3_101c.htm">*</a>
