<H1>That Subsistent Intelligence is not Corporeal</h1>

IF the understanding were a corporeal substance, intelligible ideas of 
things would be received in it only as representing individual things. 
At that rate, the understanding would have no conception of the 
universal, but only of the particular, which is manifestly false.<p>

4. If the understanding were a corporeal substance, its action would 
not transcend the order of corporeal things, and therefore it would 
understand nothing but corporeal things, which is manifestly false, for 
we do understand many things that are not corporeal.<p>

5. There can be no infinite power in any finite body: but the power of 
the understanding is in a manner infinite in the exercise of 
intelligence: for it knows the universal, which is virtually infinite 
in its logical extension.<p>

7 and 8.<A HREF="gc2_49a.htm">*</a> Of no bodily substance is the 
action turned back upon the agent. But the understanding in its action 
does reflect and turn round upon itself: for as it understands an 
object, so also it understands that it does understand, and so 
endlessly.  Hence Holy Scripture calls intelligent subsistent beings by 
the name of 'spirits,' using of them the style which it is wont to use 
for the incorporeal Deity, according to the text, <i>God is a 
Spirit</i> (John iv, 24).  Hereby is excluded the error of the ancient 
natural philosophers, who admitted no substance but corporeal 
substance: which opinion some have endeavoured to foist into the 
Christian faith, saying that the soul is an effigy of the body, a sort 
of outline contour of the human body.<A HREF="gc2_49b.htm">*</a><p>
