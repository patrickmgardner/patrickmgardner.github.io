<h1>Of the General Cause of Immutability in all Souls after their 
Separation from the Body</h1>

THE end is in matters of desire like the first principles of 
demonstration in the abstract sciences. These principles are naturally 
known, and any error concerning them could come only from a perversion 
of nature  [verging on idiotcy]: hence a man could not be moved from a 
true understanding of such principles to a false one, or from a false 
to a true, except through some change in his nature. It is impossible 
for those who go wrong over first principles to be brought right by 
other and more certain principles; or for any one to be beguiled from a 
true understanding of such principles by other principles more 
plausible. So it is in regard of the last end. Every one has a natural 
desire of the last end; and the possession of a rational nature, 
generically as such, carries with it a craving for happiness: but the 
desire of happiness and the last end in this or that shape and aspect 
comes from a special disposition of nature: hence the Philosopher says 
that as the individual is himself, so does the end appear to him.<A 
HREF="gc4_95a.htm">*</a> If then the frame of mind under which one 
desires a thing as his last end is fixed and immovable, the will of 
such a person is unchangeably fixed in the desire of that end. But 
these frames of mind, prompting such desires, can be removed from us so 
long as the soul is united with the body. Sometimes it is an impulse of 
passion that prompts us to desire a thing as our last end: but the 
impulse of passion quickly passes away, and with it is removed the 
desire of that end. In other cases the frame of mind, provocative of 
such desire, amounts to a habit; and that frame of mind is not so 
easily got rid of, and the desire of an end thence ensuing is 
consequently stronger and more lasting: yet even a habit is removable 
in this life. We have seen then that so long as the frame of mind 
lasts, which prompts us to desire a thing as our last end, the desire 
of that particular end is irremovable, because the last end, or 
whatever be taken for such, is desired above all things else; and no 
other object of greater desire can ever call us away from the desire of 
that which we take for our last end. Now the soul is in a changeable 
state so long as it is united with the body, but not after it is parted 
from the body.<A HREF="gc4_95b.htm">*</a> Separated therefore from the 
body, the soul will be no longer apt to advance to any new end, but 
must rest for ever in the end already attained. The will then will be 
immovable in its desire of what it has taken for its last end. But on 
the last end depends all the goodness or wickedness of the will. 
Whatever good things one wills in view of a good end, he does well to 
will them,<A HREF="gc4_95c.htm">*</a> as he does ill to will anything 
in view of an evil end. Thus the will of the departed soul is not 
changeable from good to evil, although it is changeable from one 
object of volition to another, its attitude to the last end remaining 
constant.<p> 

Nor is such fixedness of will inconsistent with free will. The act of 
free will is to choose, and choice is of means to the end, not of the 
last end.<A HREF="gc4_95d.htm">*</a> As then there is nothing 
inconsistent with free choice in our will being immovably fixed in the 
desire of happiness and general abhorrence of misery, so neither will 
our faculty of free choice be set aside by our will being resistlessly 
carried to one definite object as its last end.<A 
HREF="gc4_95e.htm">*</a> As at present our common nature is immovably 
fixed in the desire of happiness in general, so hereafter by one 
special frame of mind we shall be fixed in the desire of this or that 
particular object as constituting our last end.
<A HREF="gc4_95f.htm">*</a><p> 

Nor is it to be thought that when souls resume their bodies at the 
resurrection, they lose the unchangeableness of their will, for in the 
resurrection bodies will be organised to suit the requirements of the 
soul (Chapp. <A HREF="gc4_86.htm">LXXXVI</a>, <A 
HREF="gc4_89.htm">LXXXIX</a>): souls then will not be changed by 
re-entering their bodies, but will remain permanently what they were.
