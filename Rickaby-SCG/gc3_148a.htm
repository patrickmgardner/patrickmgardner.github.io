In the 'beatific vision,' cf. Chapp. <A HREF="gc3_50.htm">L</a> - <A 
HREF="gc3_51.htm">[LI]</a> - <A HREF="gc3_52.htm">LII</a>, which should 
here be re-read. This beatific vision is the 'supernatural end' of man; 
and all that properly and of itself leads to that end belongs to the 
'supernatural order.' The study of the supernatural order belongs to 
'revealed,' or 'dogmatic, theology,' not to philosophy, which deals 
with man, as man, -- with man in the natural order; and does not 
presuppose any revelation. In the above-mentioned chapters, Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc3_50.htm">L</a> - <A HREF="gc3_51.htm">[LI]</a> - <A 
HREF="gc3_52.htm">LII</a>, St Thomas has argued that after death the 
disembodied soul requires a special divine assistance to enable it to 
see God. In these present chapters his argument deals with man in this 
life, arguing that he needs special divine endowments, called 'grace,' 
enabling him so to live on earth as to be found worthy of divine vision 
when he comes to die. As he cannot see God face to face by his natural 
powers, so neither can he lead a life worthy of that vision by the mere 
strength and rectitude of human nature.
