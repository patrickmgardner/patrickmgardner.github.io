This 'dispensation,' frequently mentioned by St Thomas, seems to have 
been nothing more than <b>paresis hamart&ecirc;mat&ocirc;n</b>, that 
<i>overlooking of</i> (what in a more perfect stage of society would 
have been) sins, mentioned by St Paul (Rom. iii, 25, where, because the 
text is much misunderstood, I am compelled to refer to my <i>Notes on 
St Paul h.l.</i>). This <i>overlooking</i> appears again in Acts xvii, 
30 (<b>huperisd&ocirc;n</b>); and is referred to in Romans v, 13: 
<i>Sin is not imputed when there is no law</i>. At the time spoken of 
there was no perfect law, either revealed or natural, because a very 
rude society could not bear such perfection. I may refer to <i>Aquinas 
Ethicus</i>, I, 284, 301: <i>Political and Moral Essays</i>, pp. 184-188: 
and the conference on <i>Progressive Morality</i> in <i>Oxford and Cambridge 
Conferences</i>, Second Series, pp. 203-214. I make these somewhat 
egotistic references, because among Catholics the science of morals is 
handled sometimes as law, with canons and authorities; sometimes as 
an exact science, like mathematics, lying out of the category of time; 
seldom with much regard to history and anthropology, aspects which have 
opened out so widely since St Thomas' day.<p>
