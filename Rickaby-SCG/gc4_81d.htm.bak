What is here said is answer sufficient to the
difficulty about cannibalism, which St Thomas next
goes into. The discussion of the man who all his life
had eaten nothing but human flesh (<i>solis carnibus humanis

reared on the same peculiar fare, reads like an afternoon 
<i>causerie</i> of the Angelic Doctor with some rather
young undergraduates on the bank of the Seine.<p>
