Therefore we call God 'good' as being the
origin of goodness, and creatures 'good' as being
effects of divine goodness. But at that rate, it 
appears, we ought to know the goodness of God before
we know the goodness of creatures, which seems not
to be the case. This objection St Thomas proceeds
to clear away.
