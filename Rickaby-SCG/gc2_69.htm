<H1>Solution of the Arguments alleged to show that a Subsistent Intelligence
cannot be united with a Body as the Form of that Body<A HREF="gc2_69a.htm">*</a></h1>

The arguments wherewith Averroes endeavours to establish his
opinion do not prove that the subsistent intelligence is not united
with the body as the form of the same.<p>

1. The words of Aristotle about the potential intellect, that it is 
"impassible, unmixed, and separate,"<A HREF="gc2_69b.htm">*</a> do not 
necessitate the admission that the intellectual substance is not united 
with the body as its form, giving it being. They are sufficiently 
verified by saying that the intellectual faculty, which Aristotle calls 
the 'speculative faculty,'<A HREF="gc2_69c.htm">*</a> is not the 
actualisation of any organ, as exercising its activity through that 
organ.<p> 

2. Supposing the substance of the soul to be united in being with the 
body as the form of the body, while still the intellect is not the 
actualisation of any organ, it does not follow that intellect falls 
under the law of physical determination, as do sensible and material 
things: for we do not suppose intellect to be a harmony, or function 
(<i>ratio</i>, <b>logos</b>) of any organ, as Aristotle says that sense 
is.<A HREF="gc2_69d.htm">*</a><p> 

3. That Aristotle is saying that the intellect is 'unmingled,' or 
'separate,' does not intend to exclude it from being a part, or 
faculty, of the soul, which soul is the form of the whole body, is 
evident from this passage, where he is arguing against those who said 
that there were different parts of the soul in different parts of the 
body: -- "If the whole soul keeps together the body as a whole, it is 
fitting that each part of the soul should keep together some part of 
the body: but this looks like an impossibility: for it is difficult 
even to imagine what part of the body the intellect shall keep 
together, or how."<A HREF="gc2_69e.htm">*</a><p>
