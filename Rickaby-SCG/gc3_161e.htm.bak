The upshot of the foregoing chapter is this, that a man in mortal sin 
has got himself into a false position; and his position will go on 
growing morally worse unless he makes strenuous efforts to get out of 
it, turning to God and asking His aid: if he will not do that, he must 
be answerable for the growing deterioration of his state. He sins 
therefore, but it is not always easy to say precisely when he sins. In 
general, he sins when he could help himself to do better, and will 
not.
