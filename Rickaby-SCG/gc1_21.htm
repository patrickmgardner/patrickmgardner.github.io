<H1>That God is His own Essence<A HREF="gc1_21a.htm">*</a><P></h1>

IN everything that is not its own essence, quiddity, or nature, there 
must be some composition. For since in everything its own essence is 
contained, -- if in anything there were contained nothing but its 
essence, the whole of that thing would be its essence, and so itself 
would be its own essence.  If then anything is not its own essence, 
there must be something in that thing besides its essence, and so there 
must be in it composition. Hence also the essence in compound things is 
spoken of as a part, as humanity in man. But it has been shown that in 
God there is no composition. God therefore is His own essence.<P> 

2. That alone is reckoned to be beyond the essence of a thing, which 
does not enter into its definition: for the definition declares what 
the thing essentially is. But the accidents of a thing are the only 
points about it which fall not within the definition: therefore the 
accidents are the only points about a thing besides its essence. But in 
God there are no accidents, as will be shown (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_23.htm">XXIII</a>): therefore there is nothing in Him besides 
His essence.<P> 

3. The forms that are not predicable of subsistent things, whether in 
the universal or in the singular, are forms that do not of themselves 
subsist singly, individualised in themselves.  It is not said that 
Socrates or man or animal is whiteness; because whiteness is not 
anything subsisting singly in itself, but is individualised by the 
substance in which it exists.  Also the essences or quiddities of 
genera or species are individualised according to the definite matter 
of this or that individual, although the generic or specific quiddity 
includes form and matter in general: hence it is not said that Socrates 
or man is humanity. But the Divine Essence is something existing singly 
by itself, and individualised in itself, as will be shown (Chap.  
XLII).  The Divine Essence therefore is predicated of God in such a way 
that it can be said: 'God is His own essence.'<A
