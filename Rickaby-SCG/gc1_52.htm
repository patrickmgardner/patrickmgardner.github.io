<H1>Reasons to show how the Multitude of intelligible Ideal 
Forms has no Existence except in the Divine Understanding</h1>

IT is not to be supposed that the multitude of intelligible ideal forms 
is in any other understanding save the divine, say, the understanding 
of an angel. For in that case the divine understanding would depend, at 
least for some portion of its activity, upon some secondary intellect, 
which is impossible: for as substances are of God, so also all that is 
in substances: hence for the being of any of these forms in any 
secondary intellect there is prerequired an act of the divine 
intelligence, whereby God is cause.<P>

2. It is impossible for one intellect to perform an intellectual 
operation by virtue of another intellect being disposed to that 
operation: that intellect itself must operate, which is disposed so to 
do. The fact then of many intelligible forms being in some secondary 
intellect cannot account for the prime intellect knowing the multitude 
of such forms.
