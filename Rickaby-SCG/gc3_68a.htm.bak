"God is in all things by <i>power</i>, inasmuch as all
things are subject to His power. He is in all things
by <i>presence</i>, inasmuch as <i>all things are naked and open
to his eyes</i> (Heb. iv, 13). He is in all things by
<i>essence</i>, because His substance is at hand to all things
as the cause of their being" (<i>Sum. Theol.</i>, 1, q. 8,
art. 3). For the scholastic meaning of 'place' see
note [<A HREF="gc2_32g.htm">2.32g</a>]. 'Space' scarcely engaged St Thomas's
attention. Nor does he discuss immensity as an attribute 
of God. He declares: "We say that there was no
place or space before the world was" (<i>Sum. Theol.</i>, 1,
q. 46, art. 1, ad 4). This is tantamount to saying
that God is everywhere where creatures are; but that,
apart from creation, there is no meaning in speaking
of God as being everywhere.
