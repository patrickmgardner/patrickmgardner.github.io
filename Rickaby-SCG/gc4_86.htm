<h1>Of the Qualities of Glorified Bodies</h1>

BRIGHTNESS. Though by the merit of Christ the defect of natare [i.e., 
death] is taken away from all, good and bad alike, at the resurrection, 
there will still remain a difference between the good and bad in their 
personal attributes. It is of the essence of nature that the human soul 
be the form of the body, quickening it and preserving it in being; 
while by personal acts the soul deserves to be raised to the glory of 
the vision of God, or to be shut out from the order of this glory 
through its own fault. The bodies of all men alike will be organised as 
befits the soul, so that the soul shall be an imperishable form giving 
imperishable being to the body, because to this effect the power of God 
will entirely subject the matter of the human body to the human soul.<A 
HREF="gc4_86a.htm">*</a> But from the brightness and excellence of the 
soul that is raised to the vision of God, the body, united to such a 
soul, shall gain a further advantage. It will be entirely subject to 
the soul, God's power so disposing, not in being only, but in all its 
actions, experiences, motions and bodily qualities. As then the soul in 
the enjoyment of the vision of God will be replenished with a spiritual 
brightness, so by an overflow from soul to body, the body itself, in 
its way, will be clad in a halo and glory of brightness. Hence the 
Apostle says: <i>It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory</i> (1 
Cor. xv, 43): because our body, which now has no light of its own, shall 
then be bright and shining, according to the promise: <i>The just shall 
shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father</i> (Matt. xiii, 
43).<p> 

II. <i>Agility</i>. The soul that shall enjoy the vision of God, being 
conjoined to its last end, will find its desire fulfilled in all 
things. And because the body moves at the desire of the soul, the body 
in this case will absolutely obey the beck of the spirit in its every 
command to move: hence the bodies of the risen will be agile; and this 
is what the Apostle means, when he says: <i>It is sown in weakness: it 
shall rise in power</i> (ib.) We experience weakness in the body, in 
that it proves incapable of satisfying the soul in the movements and 
actions which the soul commands. This weakness shall then be entirely 
removed by virtue overflowing into the body from the soul united to 
God. Hence it is said of the just that <i>they shall run hither and 
thither like sparks in a dry bed of reeds</i> (Wisd. iii, 7).<p> 

III. <i>Impassibility</i>. As the soul that enjoys God will have its 
desire fulfilled in respect of the gaining of all good, so also in 
respect of the removal of all evil. The body therefore, being made 
perfect in proportion to the soul, shall be free from all evil, actual 
and potential. As for actuality, there will be in the risen no 
corruption, no deformity, no defect. In point of potentiality, the 
risen Saints will be beyond the possibility of suffering aught that 
could give them pain: they will thus be impassible. Still this does 
not bar in them that sensibility which is proper to sentient beings: 
for they will use the senses to their delight in things that are not 
inconsistent with their state of incorruption. This impassibility is 
declared by the Apostle: <i>It is sown in corruption, it shall rise in 
incorruption</i>.<p> 

IV. <i>Subtlety</i>.<A HREF="gc4_86b.htm">*</a> As the soul enjoying 
God shall perfectly adhere to Him, and share in His goodness to the 
full height of its capacity; so the body shall be perfectly subject to 
the soul, and share in its attributes so far as possible, in clearness 
of sense, in seemliness of bodily appetite, and in general perfection 
of the entire organism: for a natural object is more perfect, the more 
perfectly its matter is subject to its form. Therefore the Apostle says 
(1 Cor. xv, 44): <i>There is sown an animal body, there shall rise a 
spiritual body</i>. The risen body will be spiritual, not as being a 
spirit, but as being wholly subject to the spirit; as the present body 
is called <i>animal</i>, not because it is an animal,<A 
HREF="gc4_86c.htm">*</a> but because it is subject to animal appetites 
and needs food.<p> 

It appears by what has been said that the risen body shall be bright and
shining, incapable of suffering, moving without difficulty and labour, and
most perfectly actuated by its form.
