<H1>That the Human Soul is not transmitted by Generation<A 
HREF="gc2_86a.htm">*</a></h1>

Where the activities of active principles suppose the concurrence of a 
body, the origination also of such principles supposed bodily 
concurrence: for a thing has existence according as it has activity: 
everything is active according to its being. But when active 
principles have their activities independent of bodily concurrence, the 
reverse is the case: the genesis of such principles is not by any 
bodily generation. Now the activity of the vegitative and sentient soul 
cannot be without bodily concurrence (Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc2_57.htm">LVII</a>, <A HREF="gc2_68.htm">LXVIII</a>): but the 
activity of the intellectual soul has place through no bodily organ 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc2_69.htm">LXIX</a>). Therefore the vegitative and 
sentient souls are generated by the generation of the body, and date 
their existence from the transmission of the male <i>semen</i>, but not 
the intellectual soul.<A HREF="gc2_86b.htm">*</a> <p> 

2. If the human soul owed its origin to the transmission of the male 
<i>semen</i>, that could be only in one of two ways. Either we must 
suppose that the soul is actually in the male <i>semen</i>, being as it 
were accidentally separated from the soul of the generator as the 
<i>semen</i> is separated from the body: -- we see something of this 
sort in Annelid animals,<A HREF="gc2_86c.htm">*</a> that live when cut 
in pieces: these creatures have one soul actually and many potentially; 
and when the body is divided, a soul comes to be actually in every 
living part: -- or in another way it may be supposed that there is in 
the male <i>semen</i> a power productive of an intellectual soul, so 
that the intellectual soul may be taken to be in the said <i>semen</i> 
virtually, not actually. The first of these suppositions is impossible 
for two reasons. First, because the intelligent soul being the most 
perfect of souls and the most potent, the proper subject for it to 
perfect is a body having a great diversity of organs apt to respond to 
its manifold activities: hence the intellectual soul cannot be in the 
male <i>semen</i> cut off from the body (<i>in semine deciso</i>), 
because neither are the souls of the lower animals of the more perfect 
sort multiplied by cutting them in pieces (<i>per decisionem</i>), as 
is the case with Annelid animals. Secondly, because the proper and 
principal faculty of the intelligent soul, the intellect, not being the 
actualisation of any part of the body,<A HREF="gc2_86d.htm">*</a> 
cannot be accidentally divided with the division of the body: therefore 
neither can the intelligent soul. The second supposition (that the 
intelligent soul is virtually contained in the male <i>semen</i>) is 
also impossible. For the active power in the <i>semen</i> is effectual 
to the generation of an animal by effecting a bodily transmutation: 
there is no other way for a material power to take effect. But every 
form, which owes its being to a transmutation of matter, has being in 
dependence on matter: for (n. 3) every form, educed into existence by a 
transmutation of matter, is a form educed out of the potentiality of 
matter: for this is the meaning of a transmutation of matter, that 
something is educed into actuality out of potentiality. But an 
intelligent soul cannot be educed out of the potentiality of matter: 
for it has been shown above (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_68.htm">LXVIII</a>) 
that the intelligent soul transcends the whole power of matter, as it 
has an immaterial activity (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_69.htm">LXIX</a>). 
Therefore the intelligent soul is not induced into being by any 
transmutation of matter, and therefore not by the action of any power 
that is in the male <i>semen</i>.<p> 

5. It is ridiculous to say that any subsistent intelligence is either 
divided by division of the body or produced by any corporeal power. 
But the soul is a subsistent intelligence (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_68.htm">LXVIII</a>). Therefore it can neither be divided by 
the separation of the <i>semen</i> from the body, nor produced by any 
active power in the same.<p> 

6. If the generation of <i>this</i> is the cause of <i>that</i> coming 
to be, the destruction of <i>this</i> will be the cause of <i>that</i> 
ceasing to be. But the destruction of the body is not the cause of the 
human soul ceasing to be (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_79.htm">LXXIX</a>). 
Neither then is the generation of the body the cause of the soul 
commencing to be.<p>
