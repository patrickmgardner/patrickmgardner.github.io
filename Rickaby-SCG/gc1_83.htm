<H1>That God wills anything else than Himself
with an Hypothetical Necessity<a href="gc1_83a.htm">*</a></h1>

IN every unchangeable being, whatever once is, cannot afterwards cease 
to be. Since then God's will is unchangeable, supposing Him to will 
anything, He cannot on that supposition not will it.<p> 

2. Everything eternal is necessary. But God's will for the causation of 
any effect is eternal: for, as His being, so His willing is measured by 
eternity.  That will therefore is necessary, yet not absolutely so, 
since the will of God has no necessary connexion with this objection 
willed. It is therefore necessary hypothetically, on a supposition.<p> 

3. Whatever God once could do, He can still. His power does not grow 
less, as neither does His essence. But He cannot now not-will what He 
is already supposed to have willed, because His will cannot change: 
therefore He never could not-will whatever He once willed (<i>nunquam 
potuit non velle quidquid voluit</i>).<a href=gc1_83b.htm>*</a> It is 
therefore hypothetically necessary for Him to have willed whatever He 
has willed, as it is for Him to will whatever He does will: but in 
neither case is the necessity absolute.<p> 

4. Whoever wills anything, necessarily wills all that is necessarily 
requisite to that purpose, unless there be some defect on his part, 
either by ignorance, or because his will sometimes is drawn away by 
some passion from a right choice of means to the end: nothing of which 
can be said of God. If God then in willing Himself wills anything else 
besides Himself, He needs must will all that is necessarily required 
to the effecting of the thing willed, as it is necessary that God should 
will the being of a rational soul, if He wills the being of a man.<a
