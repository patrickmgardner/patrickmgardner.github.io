<i>Appetitum naturalem</i>. It is not easy to kill a
willow tree, nor to break up an atom of water. Unstable 
compounds are easily broken up; but the more
perfect and stable, with difficulty. This resistance
offered to destruction is the 'physical <i>nisus</i>,' often
spoken of by the schoolmen under the name of
<i>appetitus naturalis</i>.  The will is <i>appetitus rationalis</i>; and
the region of soul in which passion dwells is a
<i>appetitus sensibilis</i>.
