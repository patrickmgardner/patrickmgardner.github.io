Cf.  Vatican Council, Sess. 2, cap. 2: "Though
it is due to divine revelation that truths of God, in
themselves not inaccessible to human reason, in the
present condition of mankind can be known by all
readily, with firm certitude, and without admixture
of error; still not on that account is revelation to be
called absolutely necessary, but because God in His
infinite goodness has destined man to a supernatural
end, that is, to a share in the good things of God,
which altogether surpass the intelligence of the human
mind."  Faith is the indispensable prelude to the
beatific vision, the supernatural end of man.  Both are
immediate knowledges of God, faith the hearing of
His word on earth, vision the seeing of His face in
heaven.  Without revelation there would be some
natural knowledge of God, but not the knowledge of faith.
