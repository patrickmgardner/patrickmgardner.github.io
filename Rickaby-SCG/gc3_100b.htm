This would be a pretty argument, were all 
instruments alike capable of all things, and not limited
in efficiency each by its own nature. As it is, the word
<i>qualitercunque</i> seems to have crept into the conclusion
without being in the premises. Instruments have their
several natures and capacities, and cannot be used 
indifferently one for another. A looking-glass will not
serve for a drinking-cup. Even God could not set an
ox to govern a State, nor make a three pound weight
in a fair balance, without interference natural or 
preternatural, outweigh five pounds. Miracles are not
wrought in that way, which indeed, so far as words
go, is the very thesis of St Thomas in this chapter.
