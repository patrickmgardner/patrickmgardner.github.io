St Thomas has seven chapters (XXXIX-XLV) discussing the variety 
of creatures, why the universe is not uniform but diversified, and how 
it has come to consist of such diverse components. As regards living 
creatures, the discussion is familiar to us from Darwin's <i>Origin of 
Species</i> and the theory of Evolution. St Thomas ventures on a larger 
question, the origin of all species, inanimate as well as animate. He 
states and rejects various archaic theories; but the point of supreme 
interest to the modern mind is never raised. In all the seven chapters 
there is not one word pointing to evolution. I have been driven to make 
large omissions, omissions which I feel sure the Saint would have 
sanctioned, had he been face to face with the cosmogonies of our day. 
Life is short art is long: the ground of philosophy must not be 
cumbered with obsolete machinery.<p>  

It is pleaded on St Thomas's behalf that the question before him is a 
metaphysical one, independent altogether of the manner in which actual 
species have come into existence.<p>
