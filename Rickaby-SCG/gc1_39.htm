<H1>That in God there can be no Evil</h1>

ESSENTIAL being, and essential goodness, and all other things that bear 
the name of 'essential,' contain no admixture of any foreign element; 
although a thing that is good may contain something else besides being 
and goodness, for there is nothing to prevent the subject of one 
perfection being the subject also of another. Everything is contained 
within the bounds of its essential idea in such sort as to render it 
incapable of containing within itself any foreign element. But God is 
goodness, not merely good. There cannot therefore be in Him anything 
that is not goodness, and so evil cannot be in Him at all.<P> 

3. As God is His own being, nothing can be said of God that signifies 
participation. If therefore evil could be predicated of Him, the 
predication would not signify participation, but essence.  Now evil 
cannot be predicated of any being so as to be the essence of any: for 
to an essentially evil thing there would be wanting being, since being 
is good.<A HREF="gc1_39a.htm">*</a> There cannot be any extraneous 
admixture in evil, as such, any more than in goodness. Evil therefore 
cannot be predicated of God.<P> 

5. A thing is perfect in so far as it is in actuality: therefore it 
will be imperfect inasmuch as it is failing in actuality. Evil 
therefore is either a privation, or includes a privation, or is 
nothing.  But the subject of privation is potentiality; and that cannot 
be in God: therefore neither can evil.<P>

This truth also Holy Scripture confirms, saying: <i>God is light, and 
there is no darkness in Him,</i> (I John i, 5)  <i>Far from God impiety, 
and iniquity from the Almighty</i> (Job xxxiv, 10).
