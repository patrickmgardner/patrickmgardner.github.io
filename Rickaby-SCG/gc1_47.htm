<H1>That God perfectly understands Himself</h1>

WHEN by an impression on the understanding that power is brought to 
bear on its object, the perfection of the intellectual act depends on 
two things: one is the perfect conformity of the impression with the 
thing understood: the other is the perfect fixing of the impression on 
the understanding: which perfection is the greater, the greater the 
power of the understanding to understand. Now the mere divine essence, 
which is the intelligible representation whereby the divine 
understanding understands, is absolutely one and the same with God 
Himself and with the understanding of God.  God therefore knows Himself 
most perfectly.<P> 

6. The perfections of all creatures are found at their best in God.  
But of perfections found in creatures the greatest is to understand 
God: seeing that the intellectual nature is pre-eminent above other 
natures, and the perfection of intellect is the act of understanding, 
and the noblest object of understanding is God.  God therefore 
understands Himself perfectly.<P> 

This also is confirmed by divine authority, for the Apostle says: 
<i>The spirit of God searcheth into even the deep things of God</i> (i 
Cor. ii, 10).
