<H1>Of the Relation of Human Reason to the first Truth of Faith<A 
HREF="gc1_8a.htm">*</a></h1>

THE things of sense, from whence human reason takes its beginning of 
knowledge, retain in themselves some trace of imitation of God, 
inasmuch as they are, and are good; yet so imperfect is this trace that 
it proves wholly insufficient to declare the substance of God Himself.  
Since every agent acts to the producing of its own likeness, effects in 
their several ways bear some likeness to their causes: nevertheless the 
effect does not always attain to the perfect likeness of the agent that 
produces it. In regard then to knowledge of the truth of faith, which 
can only be thoroughly known to those who behold the substance of God, 
human reason stands so conditioned as to be able to argue some true 
likenesses to it: which likenesses however are not sufficient for any 
sort of demonstrative or intuitive comprehension of the aforesaid 
truth. Still it is useful for the human mind to exercise itself in such 
reasonings, however feeble, provided there be no presumptuous hope of 
perfect  comprehension or demonstration. With this view the authority 
of Hilary agrees, who says (<i>De Trinitate</i>, ii, 10), speaking of 
such truth : "In this belief start, run, persist; and though I know 
that you will not reach the goal, still I shall congratulate you as I 
see you making progress. But intrude not into that sanctuary, and 
plunge not into the mystery of infinite truth; entertain no 
presumptuous hope of comprehending the height of intelligence, but 
understand that it is incomprehensible."<P>
