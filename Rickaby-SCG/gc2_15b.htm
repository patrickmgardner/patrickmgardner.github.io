This argument rests unfortunately on a theory of physical nature, to 
which there is no counterpart <i>in rerum natura</i>, the theory of the 
'four elements,' a physical presentation of Plato's doctrine of Ideas. 
<i>Fire</i> was taken to be ideally <i>hot</i>, and the cause of all 
heat: <i>air</i> ideally <i>cold</i>, and the cause of all cold: 
<i>water</i> ideally <i>humid</i>, and cause of all humidity; 
<i>earth</i> ideally <i>dry</i>, and cause of all dryness. The 
mediaeval mind delighted in this ~ocurrence to unity, ascribing all the 
particulars of a kind to some one source and cause, the perfect 
expression of that kind. Thus motion was traced to one <i>primum 
mobile</i>, political power to the Emperor, etc. The unities of nature 
are not so easy to discern in the light of our increased knowledge. 
Nature is more manifold and broken into detail than as St Thomas knew 
it. It is true that the sun, "warmest and brightest of beings," is the 
chief cause of heat and light that make human existence on earth 
possible; -- to the sun we owe the coal-forests, -- and we may observe 
that the sun is thus an image of God in the universe: but this is an 
analogy, not an argument. St Thomas's conclusion, so far as I see, 
gains no support from modern physics: but, metaphysically, it may be 
urged thus. -- God is <i>ex hypothesi</i> the ideal Being, the fulness 
of Being: the name 'God' means no less than that. If then there be a 
God at all, all other being must be derived from Him.
