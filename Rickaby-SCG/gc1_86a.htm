Reason is absolutely assignable for the volitions
of God regarding the universe: but <i>relatively to us</i>,
we can assign it but vaguely, and, revelation apart,
with much uncertainty. By aid of the Aristotelian
and Ptolemaic cosmogonies, mediaeval writers had
much to say of "the perfection of the universe,"
over which sayings the modern astronomer stands
amazed, murmuring low to himself, if he is a pious
man, <i>Nimis profundae factae sunt cogitationes tuae</i>
(Ps. xci). A characteristic of the Middle Ages is
idealisation of unity, permanence, and systematic
completeness in the social, political, religious, and
even in the cosmic order. To us "the perfection of
the universe" is a less obvious ground of argument,
There is such a perfection, doubtless, as the Creator
is wise and good; and much of the wisdom and
beauty of His work is manifest to our eyes; but the
entirety is beyond us. We cannot comprehend it, as
we cannot comprehend Him.
