That Aristotle, in common with the plain man, held every man's 
intelligence to be in him, of him, and his, and not extrinsic to him, I 
think is evident from these citations. On the other hand, that 
Aristotle did not take these separate human intelligences somehow to be 
effluxes of one great Intelligence, to which they returned, and were 
re-united with it in death, is not so clear. We are at a loss to assign 
his exact meaning in such passages as <i>De anima</i>, II, iii, 5; III, 
v, 3; and especially <i>De gen. animal</i>, II, iii, 10. <b>leipetai de 
ton noun monon thurathen epeisienai kai theion einai monon</b> (the 
conclusion remains, that intelligence alone comes in from without and 
is alone divine). Some pre-existence of the intellectual soul seems 
necessary in the Aristotelian system, as Aristotle nowhere recognises 
the notion of creation out of nothing, any more than Plato. He differs 
from Plato in being opposed to the transmigration of souls (<i>De 
anima</i>, I, iii, 26); and in his reticence upon a point upon which 
Plato was very explicit, the individuality of separate souls after 
death.
