This argument is confidently urged by St Ambrose, <i>De Spiritu 
Sancto</i>, ii, 6, from whom St Thomas takes it. The value of it 
depends on a variant reading in the Greek. The <i>textus receptus</i> 
has <b>hoi pneumati the&ocirc; latreuontes</b>; and such must have been 
the reading of St Chrysostom, who explains <b>pneumati, toutestin, 
pneumatik&ocirc;s</b>: with this interpretation, he cannot have read 
<b>theou</b>, as MSS represent him. The Vulgate agrees, <i>qui spiritu 
Deo servimus</i>, 'we who in spirit serve the Lord.' So too &agrave; 
Lapide. with this reading, <b>the&ocirc;</b>, which St Thomas also 
supposes, the interpretation which he gives cannot stand. <i>We who 
serve the Spirit of God</i>, would require <b>hoi the&ocirc; t&ocirc; 
pneumati latreuontes</b>. For the text as it stands, 'we who serve God 
as a Spirit,' is quite a possible translation (cf. John iv, 24), though 
that is not to St Thomas's purpose. But there is another reading, 
<b>theou</b>, adopted by Westcott and Hort. St Thomas was a stranger to 
this reading, but it is the making of his argument. <b>hoi pneumati 
theou latreuontes</b> can only mean 'we who serve the Spirit of God.' I 
am inclined, however, to think that the Vulgate is right, that 
<b>the&ocirc;</i> is the reading, that <b>pneumati</b> means 
<b>pneumatik&ocirc;s</b> and that the argument is untenable.
