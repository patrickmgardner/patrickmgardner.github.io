<H1>How one separately subsisting Intelligence knows another</h1>

AS separately subsisting intelligences understand proper terms of 
intellect; and the said intelligences are themselves such terms, -- for 
it is independence of matter that makes a thing be a proper term of 
intellect; it follows that separately subsisting intelligences 
understand other such intelligences, finding in them their proper 
objects. Every such intelligence therefore will know both itself and 
its fellows.<A HREF="gc2_98a.htm">*</a> It will know itself, but in a 
different way from that in which the human potential intellect knows 
itself. For the potential intellect is only potentially intelligible, 
and becomes actually such by being impressed with an intellectual 
impression. Only by such an impression does it become cognisant of 
itself. But separately subsisting intelligences by their nature are 
actually intelligible<A HREF="gc2_98b.htm">*</a>: hence every one of 
them knows himself by his own essence, not by any impression 
representative of another thing.<p> 

<i>A difficulty:</i> Since all knowledge, as it is the knowing mind, is 
a likeness of the thing known, and one separately subsistent 
intelligence is like another generically, but differs from it in 
species (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_93.htm">XCIII</a>), it appears that one 
does not know another in species, but only so far as the two meet in 
one common ratio, that of the genus.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i> With subsistent beings of a higher order than we are, 
the knowledge contained in higher generalities is not incomplete, as it 
is with us. The likeness in the mind of 'animal,' whereby we know a 
thing generically only, yields us a less complete knowledge than the 
likeness of 'man,' whereby we know an entire species. To know a thing 
by its genus is to know it imperfectly and, as it were, potentially; to 
know it by its species is to know it perfectly and actually. Holding 
as it does the lowest rank among subsistent intelligences, our 
intellect stands in such pressing need of particular detailed 
likenesses, that for every distinct object of its knowledge it requires 
a distinct likeness in itself: hence the likeness of 'animal' does not 
enable it to know 'rational,' consequently not 'man' either, except 
imperfectly. But the intellectual presentation in an intelligence 
subsisting apart is of a higher power, apt to represent more, and leads 
to a knowledge, not less perfect, but more perfect. By one 
presentation such an intelligence knows both 'animal' and the several 
specific <i>differentias</i> which make the several species of animals: 
this knowledge is more or less comprehensive according to the 
hierarchical rank of the intelligence.<A HREF="gc2_98c.htm">*</a> We 
may illustrate this truth by contrasting the two extremes, the divine 
and human intellect. God knows all things by the one medium of His 
essence; man requires so many several likenesses, images or 
presentations in the mind, to know so many several things. Yet even in 
man the higher understanding gathers more from fewer presentations: 
slow minds on the other hand need many particular examples to lead them 
to knowledge. Since a separately subsistent intelligence, considered 
in its nature, is potentially open to the presentations whereby 'being' 
in its entirety (<i>totum ens</i>) is known, we cannot suppose that 
such an intelligence is denuded of all such presentations, as is the 
case with the potential intellect in use ere it comes to understand.<A 
HREF="gc2_98d.htm">*</a> Nor again can we suppose that this separately 
subsistent intelligence has some of these presentations actually, and 
others, potentially only. For separate intelligences do not change 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc2_97.htm">XCVII</a>); but every potentiality in them 
must be actualised. Thus then the intellect of the separately 
subsistent intelligence is perfected to the full extent of its capacity 
by intelligible forms, so far as natural knowledge goes.<A
