<H1>That Subsistent Intelligences are Voluntary Agents</h1>

GOOD is what all things yearn after, and in all beings there is a 
craving  (<i>appetitus</i>) for good. In beings unendowed with any sort 
of cognition,  this craving is called 'physical appetite' (<i>appetitus 
naturalis</i>) .<A HREF="gc2_47a.htm">*</a> In beings that have 
sensitive cognition it is called 'animal appetite,' and is divided into 
'concupiscible' and 'irascible.'<A HREF="gc2_47b.htm">*</a> In 
intelligent beings it is called the 'intellectual' or 'rational 
appetite,' otherwise the 'will.'<p>
