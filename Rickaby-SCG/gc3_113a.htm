<i>Naturalia non sunt in nobis</i>, the natural being marked off from 
the voluntary (<A HREF="gc3_106a.htm">note [3.106a]</a>). The natural 
appetites, apart from their voluntary gratification to this or that 
effect, do not induce acts of the individual man, but acts of the species 
man. Such acts are not the acts of Charles or James: they are racial, 
not personal; and so long as they remain racial, and are not in any 
way brought about or taken up by the will of the person in whom they 
occur, they are outside of the category of morality, being neither 
moral nor immoral, but organic.
