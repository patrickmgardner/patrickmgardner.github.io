<H1>That in Created Subsistent Intelligences there is  
Actuality and Potentiality</h1>

IN whatever being there are found two elements, the one complementary  
to the other, the proportion of the one element to the other is as the 
proportion of potential to actual: for nothing is completed except by 
its own actuality. But in a created intelligent subsistent being there 
are two elements, the substance itself and the existence thereof which 
is not the same thing as the substance. Now that existence is the 
complement of the existing substance: for everything actually exists by 
having existence. It follows that in every one of the aforesaid 
substances there is a composition of actuality and potentiality.<p>

2. What is in any being, and comes of the agent that produced it, must 
be the actuality of that being: for it is an agent's function to make a 
thing be in actuality. But, as shown above (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_15.htm">XV</a>), all other substances have their existence of 
the prime agent: indeed their being created substances consists 
precisely in this, that they have their existence of another. Existence 
itself therefore is in these created substances as a sort of 
actualisation of the same. But that in which actuality is received is 
potentiality: for actuality is such in relation to potentiality. In 
every created subsistent being therefore there is potentiality and 
actuality.<p>
