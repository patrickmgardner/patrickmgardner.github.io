The proof referred to rests principally on this, that the Creator works 
not upon any pre-existent material. But this and the other arguments of 
Chap. <A HREF="gc2_22.htm">XXII</a> do not touch the idealist and 
pantheist position, that the Supreme Mind thinks in necessary grooves 
or forms; that what theologians call 'creatures' are but the necessary 
thoughts of God; and that nothing is really possible but what thus 
actually comes to be. This position is taken account of more in Chap. 
<A HREF="gc2_26.htm">XXVI</a>. It may be also met thus. We may lay down 
a psychological proof of the freedom of the human will; and thence 
argue that a perfection so conspicuous in the human mind cannot be 
denied to the Supreme Mind. -- see <i>Free-will in God and Man</i> in 
<i>Oxford and Cambridge Conferences</i>, 1900, 1901, pp. 142 sq. (Sands 
and Co., London).
