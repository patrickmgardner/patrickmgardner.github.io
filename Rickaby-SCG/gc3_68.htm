<H1>That God is everywhere and in all things</h1>

AN incorporeal thing is said to be <i>in</i> a thing by contact of 
power. Therefore if there be anything incorporeal fraught with infinite 
power, that must be everywhere. But it has been shown (B. I Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_43.htm">XLIII</a>) that God has infinite power. He is 
therefore everywhere.<p>

4. Since God is the universal cause of all being, in whatever region 
being can be found there must be the divine presence.<p>

6. An efficient cause must be together with its proximate and immediate 
effect. But in everything there is some effect which must be set down 
for the proximate and immediate effect of God's power: for God alone 
can create (B. II, Chap. <A HREF="gc2_21.htm">XXI</a>); and in 
everything there is something caused by creation, -- in corporeal 
things, primordial matter; in incorporeal beings, their simple essences 
(B. II, Chapp. <A HREF="gc2_15.htm">XV</a>, sq). God then must be in 
all things, especially since the things which He has once produced from 
not-being to being He continually and always preserves in being (Chap. 
<A HREF="gc3_65.htm">LXV</a>).<p>

Hence it is said: <i>I fill heaven and earth</i> (Jer. xxiii, 24): <i>If 
I ascend into heaven, thou art there: if I descend into hell, thou art 
there</i> (Ps. cxxxviii, 8).<p>

God is indivisible, and wholly out of the category of the continuous: 
hence He is not determined to one place, great or small, by the 
necessity of His essence, seeing that He is from eternity before all 
place: but by the immensity of His power He reaches all things that are 
in place, since He is the universal cause of being. Thus then He is 
whole everywhere, reaching all things by His undivided power.
