<h1>That Risen Bodies shall be of the same Nature as before</h1>

SOME have supposed that in the resurrection our bodies are transformed 
into spirit, because the Apostle says: <i>There is sown an animal body, 
there shall rise a spiritual body</i> (1 Cor. xv, 40).<A 
HREF="gc4_84a.htm">*</a> And the text, <i>Flesh and blood shall not 
possess the kingdom of God</i> (i Cor. xv, 50), has prompted the 
conjecture that risen bodies shall not have flesh and blood. But this 
is a manifest error.<p> 

1. Our resurrection shall be on the model of the resurrection of 
Christ, <i>who will reform the body of our humiliation, so that it 
shall become conformable to the body of his glory</i> (Phil. iii, 21). 
But Christ after His resurrection had a body that could be felt and 
handled, as He says: <i>Feel and see, because a spirit hath not flesh 
and bones as you see me to have</i> (Luke xxiv, 39): in like manner 
therefore also other risen men.<p> 

5. For numerically the same man to rise again, his essential parts must
be numerically the same. If then the body of the risen man shall not consist
of these muscles and these bones of which it is now composed, the risen man
will not be numerically the same.<A HREF="gc4_84b.htm">*</a><p>

6. The supposition of the body passing into a spirit is altogether 
impossible: for those things only pass into one another which have some 
matter in common [cf. Chap. <A HREF="gc4_63.htm">LXIII</a>].<p> 

7. If the body passes into a spiritual substance, it must either pass 
into that spiritual substance which is the soul, or into some other. If 
into that which is the soul, then in the resurrection there will be 
nothing in man but soul, and he will be exactly as he was before the 
resurrection. But if into another spiritual substance, then two 
spiritual substances will be one in nature, which is impossible, since 
every spiritual substance subsists by itself.<p> 

9. He who rises again must be an animal, if he is to be a man.<A
