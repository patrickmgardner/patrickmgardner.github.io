<h1>That in the Resurrection there will be no use of Food or 
Intercourse of the Sexes</h1>

WHEN our perishable life is over, those things which serve the
needs of a perishable existence must also come to an end. One such
thing is food, which serves to supply the waste of the body.<A 
HREF="gc4_83a.htm">*</a><p>

The use of the intercourse of the sexes is for generation. If then such 
intercourse is to continue after the resurrection, unless it is to 
continue to no purpose, many men will come to exist after the 
resurrection, who did not exist before.<A HREF="gc4_83b.htm">*</a><p> 

But if any one says that in the risen Saints there will be use of food 
and sexual intercourse, not for the preservation of the individual and 
of the species, but solely for the pleasure that goes with such acts, 
to the end that no pleasure may be lacking in man's final reward, -- 
such a saying is fraught with many absurdities. In the first place, the 
life of the risen Saints will be better ordered than our present life. 
But in this present life it is a disorderly and vicious thing to make 
use of food and procreation solely for pleasure, and not for the need 
of sustaining the body or rearing children. For the pleasures that 
attend such actions are not the ends of those actions, but rather the 
action is the end and purpose of the pleasure, nature having arranged 
for pleasure as a concomitant of such actions, lest for the labour that 
goes with them animals should desist from these actions necessary to 
nature, as they certainly would desist, were they not enticed by 
pleasure. It is therefore a perversion of order and an indecency for 
actions to be done solely for the pleasure that goes with them (B. III, 
Chap. <A HREF="gc3_27.htm">XXVII</a>). This then shall nowise be the 
case with the risen Saints, whose life we must assume to be a life of 
perfect order and propriety. Moreover the notion is ridiculous of 
seeking bodily pleasures, common to us with brute animals, where there 
are in view the highest delights, shared with the angels, in the vision 
of God (B. III, Chap. <A HREF="gc3_51.htm">LI</a>). Hence the Lord 
says: <i>In the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be given in 
marriage, but shall be as the angels of God</i> (Matt. xxii, 30).<p> 

As for the alleged example of Adam, the perfection of Adam was 
personal, but human nature was not yet entirely perfect, as the race of 
mankind was not yet multiplied. Adam then was constituted in the 
perfection proper to the origin of the human race, for the 
multiplication of which he needed to beget children, and consequently 
to make use of food.<A HREF="gc4_83b.htm">*</a> But the maturity of the 
risen state is when human nature shall have come to its full 
perfection, and the number of the elect shall be complete. Then shall 
generation no more have place, nor the use of food. Therefore the 
immortality and incorruption of the risen Saints shall be different 
from that which was in Adam. The immortality and incorruption of the 
risen Saints will consist in their being incapable of death, or of the 
dissolution of any part of their bodily frame. The immortality of Adam 
consisted in his being capable of immortality, provided he did not sin, 
and capable of death, if he did sin; and this was secured, not by the 
prevention of all bodily waste in him, but by the aid of food to 
counteract an entire dissolution. <p> 

The Scripture texts that seem to promise the use of food after the 
resurrection, are to be understood in  a spiritual sense. What is said 
in the Apocalypse, xx, 4, of the <i>thousand years</i>, is to be 
understood of the resurrection of souls rising from sin, -- cf. Eph. v, 
14, <i>Rise from the dead, and Christ shall enlighten thee</i>; and the 
thousand years means the whole period of Church history, during which 
the martyrs reign with Christ, and the other saints, as well in that 
kingdom of God which is the Church on earth, as in the heavenly country 
of departed souls.<p> 

Hence we may finally conclude that all the activities of the active 
life shall cease, as they all bear upon the use of food, and the 
getting of children, and other necessities of a perishable existence. 
Alone left in the risen Saints shall be the occupation of the 
contemplative life: wherefore it is said of the contemplative Mary: 
<i>Mary hath chosen the better part, which shall not be taken from 
her</i> (Luke x, 42).<p>
