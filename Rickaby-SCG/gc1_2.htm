<H1>Of the Author's Purpose</h1>

OF all human pursuits, the pursuit of wisdom is the more perfect, the more 
sublime, the more useful, and the more agreeable. The more perfect, because in 
so far as a man gives himself up to the pursuit of wisdom, to that extent he 
enjoys already some portion of true happiness. <i>Blessed is the man that shall 
dwell in wisdom</i> (Ecclus xiv, 22). The more sublime, because thereby man 
comes closest to the likeness of God, who <i>hath made all things in wisdom</i> 
(Ps.  ciii, 24).  The more useful, because by this same wisdom we arrive at the 
realm of immortality. <i>The desire of wisdom shall lead to an everlasting 
kingdom</i> (Wisd.  vi, 21).  The more agreeable, because <i>her conversation 
hath no bitterness, nor her company any weariness, but gladness and joy</i> 
(Wisd. viii, 16).<P>

But on two accounts it is difficult to proceed against each particular
error: first, because the sacrilegious utterances of our various erring 
opponents are not so well known to us as to enable us to find reasons, drawn from
their own words, for the confutation of their errors: for such was the 
method of the ancient doctors in confuting the errors of the Gentiles, whose
tenets they were readily able to know, having either been Gentiles 
themselves, or at least having lived among Gentiles and been instructed in their
doctrines. Secondly, because some of them, as Mohammedans and Pagans,
do not agree with us in recognising the authority of any scripture, 
available for their conviction, as we can argue against the Jews from the Old
Testament, and against heretics from the New. But these receive neither:
hence it is necessary to have recourse to natural reason, which all are obliged
to assent to. But in the things of God natural reason is often at a loss.
