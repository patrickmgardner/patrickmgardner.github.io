<i>In a great house there are not only vessels of gold
and silver, but also of wood and earthenware, and some
unto honour, some unto dishonour</i> (2 Tim. ii, 20). Yes,
but we should like to have every vessel good of its
kind; sound earthenware as well as 22-carat gold.
<i>Per se</i> it is so, <i>per accidens</i> often not. The human
spirit ever finds some retort upon these justifications.
Investigable up to a certain point, the dark continent
of evil stretches away beyond into mystery; and there
is nothing for it but to trust God.
