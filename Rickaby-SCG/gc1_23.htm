<H1>That in God there is no Accident</h1>

EVERYTHING that is in a thing accidentally has a cause for its being 
therein, seeing that it is beside the essence of the thing wherein it 
is. If then there is anything in God accidentally, this must be by some 
cause.  Either therefore the cause of the accident is the Divinity 
itself, or something else. If something else, that something must act 
upon the divine substance: for nothing induces any form, whether 
substantial or accidental, in any recipient, except by acting in some 
way upon it, because acting is nothing else than making something 
actually be, which is by a form. Thus God will be acted upon and moved 
by some agent, which is against the conclusions of Chapter XIII.  But 
if the divine substance itself is the cause of the accident supposed to 
be in it, then, -- inasmuch as it cannot possibly be the cause of it in 
so far as it is the recipient of it, because at that rate the same 
thing in the same respect would actualise itself, -- then this 
accident, supposed to be in God, needs must be received by Him in one 
respect and caused by Him in another, even as things corporeal receive 
their proper accidents by the virtue of their matter, and cause them by 
their form.  Thus then God will be compound, the contrary of which has 
been above proved.<A HREF="gc1_23a.htm">*</a><P>
 
4. In whatever thing anything is accidentally, that thing is in some 
way changeable in its nature: for accident as such may be and may not 
be in the thing in which it is.  If then God has anything attaching to 
Him accidentally, it follows that He is changeable, the contrary of 
which has above been proved (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_13.htm">XIII</a>, <A 
HREF="gc1_15.htm">XV</a>).<P> 

5. A thing into which an accident enters, is not all and everything 
that is contained in itself: because accident is not of the essence of 
the subject.  But God is whatever He has in Himself.  Therefore in God 
there is no accident. -- The premises are proved thus.  Everything is 
found more excellently in cause than in effect.<A 
HREF="gc1_23b.htm">*</a> But God is cause of all: therefore whatever is 
in Him is found there in the most excellent way possible.  But what 
most perfectly attaches to a thing is the very thing itself. This unity 
of identity is more perfect than the substantial union of one element 
with another, e.g., of form with matter; and that union again is more 
perfect than the union that comes of one thing being accidentally in 
another. It remains therefore that God is whatever He has.<P> 

Hence Augustine (<i>De Trinitate</i>, v, c. 4, n. 5): "There is nothing 
accidental in God, because there is nothing changeable or perishable." 
The showing forth of this truth is the confutation of sundry Saracen 
jurists, who suppose certain "ideas" superadded to the Divine 
Essence.<A HREF="gc1_23c.htm">* </a>
