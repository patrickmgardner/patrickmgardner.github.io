The force of this admission will appear in the next two chapters. Two 
propositions must be kept apart: --<p> 

(a) The origin of the intellectual soul of man is synchronous with the 
moment of conception.<p> 

(b) The intellectual soul of man is, as the body of man, simply a 
product of conception.<p> 

St Thomas denies both these propositions. Modern Catholic theologians 
usually are content with denying the second only.<p>
