Eusebius, <i>De paraparitione evangelii</i>, B. V, Chapp.
vii-x, quotes the Neo-Platonist Porphyry's Letter to
Anebo the Egyptian. St Augustine, <i>De civitate Dei</i>,
B. X, Chap. xi, also quotes him; and from St Augustine 
St Thomas borrows his quotations. The passages
of Eusebius and Augustine are worth reading, as 
contributing to the literature of Spiritualism. Eusebius
calls Anebo an Egyptian prophet. Porphyry's Letter
to him exists only in fragments.
