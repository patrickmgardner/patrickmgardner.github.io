<H1>Arguments against Voluntary Poverty, with Replies</h1>

THERE have been found persons to condemn voluntary poverty, thereby 
going against the teaching of the gospel, Of these Vigilantius was the 
first. He has had imitators, men <i>making themselves out to be doctors 
of the law, not understanding either what they say or about what they 
affirm</i> (i Tim. i, 7).<A HREF="gc3_132a.htm">*</a> They have been 
led by these and the like reasons.<p> 

<i>Arg. 1</i>. Animals that cannot find the necessaries of life at any 
time of the year, have a natural instinct for gathering such 
necessaries at a time when they can be found, and laying them up, as we 
see in bees and ants. But men need many things for the preservation of 
their life, which cannot be found any time. Therefore man has a natural 
tendency to gather together and lay up such things, and it is against 
the law of nature to scatter them again.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. Still it is not necessary for every one to be busy with 
this task of gathering: as even among bees not all have the same duty, 
some gather honey, others make cells out of wax, -- to say nothing of 
the queen-bees being exempt from all such occupations. And so it must 
be with men: for many things being necessary to human life, for which 
one man by himself cannot suffice, different functions have to be 
undertaken by different men, -- some have to labour in the fields, some 
to tend cattle, and some to build. And because human life needs not 
only corporal but also spiritual aids, some have to devote themselves 
to spiritual things for the benefit of the rest; and these persons 
should be set free from the care of temporals.<p> 

<i>Arg. 2</i>. As every one is bound by natural law to preserve his 
life, so also his exterior substance, as being the means whereby life 
is preserved.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. For them who relinquish temporal things there still 
remains every likelihood and hope of finding the sustenance necessary 
for life, either through their own labour, or the benefactions of 
others, whether in the shape of possessions held in common or of food 
daily given: for what we can do through our friends, in a manner we can 
do of ourselves, as the Philosopher says (<i>Eth. Nic.</i> VIII, xi).<p> 

<i>Arg. 3</i>. Man is by nature a social animal. But society cannot be 
maintained among men except on a system of mutual aid. To take their 
part in this system of aid they render themselves incapable, who fling 
away their exterior substance.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. It is a greater thing to aid another in spirituals than 
in temporals, spiritual things being the more necessary to the end of 
final happiness. Hence he who by voluntary poverty strips himself of 
the ability to aid others in temporals, in order to the acquirement of 
spiritual good, whereby he may aid others to better advantage, does 
nothing against the good of human society.<p> 

<i>Arg. 4</i>. If it is an evil thing to have worldly substance, a good 
thing to rid neighbours of evil, and an evil thing to lead them into 
evil, it follows that to give any of the substance of this world to a 
needy person is evil, and to take away such substance from him who has 
it is good: which is absurd. It is therefore a good thing to have 
worldly substance, and to fling it entirely away by voluntary poverty 
is evil.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. Wealth is a good thing for man, so far as it is directed 
to rational good, but not in itself:<A HREF="gc3_132b.htm">*</a> hence 
poverty may very well be better than wealth, if by poverty man finds 
his way to a more perfect good.<p> 

<i>Arg. 5</i>. Occasions of evil are to be shunned. But poverty is an 
occasion of evil, leading men on to thefts, flatteries, perjuries, and 
the like.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. Neither riches, nor poverty, nor any other exterior 
condition is of itself the good of man. Such things are good only as 
tending to the good of reason. Hence vice may arise out of any of them, 
when they are not turned to man's use according to the rule of reason. 
Still not for that are they to be accounted simply evil, but only the 
abuse of them is evil.<p> 

<i>Arg. 6</i>. Virtue, lying in the mean, is spoilt by either extreme. 
There is a virtue called liberality, which consists in giving where one 
should give, and holding one's hand where one should hold it. On the 
side of defect is the vice of stinginess, which holds its hand in all 
cases indiscriminately. On the side of excess is the vice of lavish 
giving away of everything, as is done by those who embrace voluntary 
poverty, a vice akin to prodigality.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. The golden mean is not determined according to quantity 
of exterior goods, but according to the rule of reason. Hence sometimes 
it happens that what is extreme in quantity of some exterior commodity 
is the mean according to the rule of reason. There is none who tends to 
great things more than the magnanimous man, or who in expenditure 
surpasses the munificent, or princely man.<A HREF="gc3_132c.htm">*</a> 
The rule of reason does not measure the mere quantity of commodity 
employed, but the condition of the person and his intention, fitness of 
place, time, and the like, also many conditions of virtue. Therefore 
one does not run counter to virtue by voluntary poverty, even though 
one abandon all things. Nor is this an act of prodigality, seeing that 
it is done with a due end and other due conditions. To expose oneself 
to death, under due conditions, is an act of fortitude and a virtue: 
yet that is going far beyond the abandonment of one's possessions.
