But all our experience of life involves change.  Our experience lends 
itself more readily to the conception of eternal death than of eternal 
life. To our eye, the motionless and changeless is the dead, the effete 
and exhausted, or the inanimate.  Yet we dare to predicate eternity of 
a <i>living God</i>! The difficulty is met in the next chapter, where 
it is argued that God is <i>pure actuality</i>, an activity and life so 
full as to be above change.
