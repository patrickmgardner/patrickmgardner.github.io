<H1>That not all Punishments nor all Rewards are Equal</h1>

AS there are degrees in virtuous actions and in sins (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_140.htm">CXL</a>), so there must be degrees of rewards and 
punishments: for so the equality of distributive justice requires, that 
unequal returns be made for unequal services.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>According to the measure of the sin shall also be 
the measure of the stripes</i> (Deut. xxv, 2).
