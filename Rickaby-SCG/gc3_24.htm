<H1>That all Things seek good, even Things devoid of 
Consciousness</h1>

As the heavenly sphere is moved by a subsistent intelligence (Chap. 
XXIII), and the movement of the heavenly sphere is directed to 
generation in sublunary creatures, the generations and and movements of 
these sublunary creatures must originate in the thought of that 
subsistent intelligence.  Now the intention of the prime agent and of 
the instrument is bent upon the same end.  The heavenly spheres then 
(<i>coelum</i>) are the cause of sublunary motions by virtue of their 
own motion, which is impressed upon them by a spirit.  It follows that 
the heavenly spheres are the instrument of spirit.  Spirit then is the 
prime agent, causing and intending the forms and motions of sublunary 
bodies; while the heavenly spheres are the instruments of the same.  
But the intellectual outlines of all that is caused and intended by an 
intelligent agent must pre-exist in his mind, as the forms of works of 
art pre-exist in the mind of the artificer, and from that mind (<i>et 
ex eo</i>) those forms must pass into the things made.  All the forms 
then that are in sublunary creatures, and all their motions, are 
determined by the forms that are in the mind of some subsistent 
intelligence, or intelligences.  Therefore Boethius says that the forms 
which are in matter have come from forms apart from matter.  In this 
respect the saying of Plato is verified, that forms existing apart are 
the originating principles of the forms that are in matter: only, Plato 
supposed these forms to subsist by themselves, and to be immediate 
causes of the forms of sensible things; we suppose them to exist in a 
mind, and to cause sublunary forms through the instrumentality of the 
motion of the heavenly spheres.<p>

Thus it is not difficult to see how natural bodies, devoid of 
intelligence, move and act for an end.  For they tend to their end, 
being directed thereto by a subsistent intelligence, in the way that an 
arrow tends to its end, directed by the archer: as the arrow from the 
impulse of the archer, so do natural bodies receive their inclination 
to their natural ends from natural moving causes, whence they derive 
their forms and virtues and motions.  Hence it is plain that every work 
of nature is the work of a subsistent intelligence.<A 
HREF="gc3_24a.htm">*</a>  The credit of an effect rests by preference 
with the prime mover, who guides instruments to their purpose, rather 
than with the instruments which he guides.  Thus we find the operations 
of nature proceeding in due course and order to an end, like the the 
operations of a wise man.  It is evident therefore that even agents 
devoid of consciousness can work for an end, and strive after good with 
a natural appetite, and seek the divine likeness and their own 
perfection.  It is further evident that, the more perfect the power and 
the more eminent the degree of goodness, the more general is the 
appetite for good, and the more distant from self are the objects for 
which good is sought and unto which good is done.  For imperfect beings 
tend solely to the good of the individual; perfect beings to the good 
of the species; more perfect beings to the good of the genus; and God, 
who is the most perfect in goodness, to the good of all being.  Hence 
some say, not without reason, that goodness as such is diffusive of 
itself.<p>
