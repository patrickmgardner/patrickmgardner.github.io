If asked, 'Why does the train start at 6.30?' I should answer, 'Because 
the traffic manager has so arranged it.' He might have taken the train 
off, or put it at another hour, or, with the concurrence of the 
Directors, have suspended traffic altogether. The Time Tables represent 
the Manager's will: yet by no means his arbitrary will. A Time Table 
drawn up at hap-hazard would result in a block of the whole line: it 
would not work. The Time Tables consequently are drawn up with much 
care and forethought for the natures of trains and the exigencies of 
traffic. The Manager controls actualities, but not possibilities and 
conveniences. He must make his actual appointments tally with what he 
finds possible and convenient.<p> 

In like manner all actuality in creatures depends on the mere will of 
God. And God need not will to create anything at all. He might have 
acquiesced in His own existence, with nothing but Himself alone in any 
way existing. So says St Thomas, and so the Catholic Church, in 
opposition to the determinist idealism of Hegel, who makes the universe 
and its on-goings consist of the irreversible thoughts and 
thought-processes of Deity. On the other hand God's power of creating 
is not an arbitrary power to create anything and everything that a 
foolish fancy may call up. He cannot give reality to intrinsic 
absurdities. He cannot, we may venture to think, create a race of 
mortal men without stomachs, or animals whose natural food should be 
stones, or a circle having the properties of a cycloid, or a politician 
licensed to lie. If He creates, He must create according to the eternal 
exemplars, the natures of things, as He views them in order of 
possibility in Himself.  These eternal exemplars, or 'intelligible 
essences' as the schoolmen call them, represent whatever of truth there 
was in Plato's Ideas. They are founded upon the divine nature, as 
imitable outside of God: they are discerned in the divine intellect: 
they do not depend, formally speaking, on the divine will. God's will 
and decree does not make and unmake possibilities. These 
intelligibilia, on the lines of which creation must take place, if 
creation there is to be at all, are treated of in B. I, Chapp. 
XLIX-LIV. They were ignored by the ultra-Nominalists, who took all 
meaning out of the phrase 'the nature of things,' and, like those 
'doctors of the Mohammedan law' whom St Thomas mentions, ascribed all 
events without distinction to the arbitrary will of the Creator.<p> 

With these archetypal Ideas, according to which creation is laid out, 
and athwart of which it cannot run, we are very imperfectly acquainted. 
Consequently our predication cannot travel far, when we undertake to 
pronounce what things are intrinsically possible and what impossible, 
what things absolutely God could do, and what things He absolutely 
could not. More things probably are intrinsically impossible than we 
are aware of. Among the meshes of this necessary system of the nature 
of things (a necessity founded upon the divine nature itself) the 
divine will ranges free, electing to actualise this possibility in 
creation, and to leave that unactualised.<p> 

From this chapter of St Thomas I have been constrained to excise much 
obsolete physics. To examine the plan of creation, in an age when men 
knew nothing of physical nature, microscopic and telescopic, molecular 
and sidereal, beyond what their unassisted senses could detect, and 
knew that little ill, -- was a laudable effort, but could lead to no 
more than provisional results. A modern Aquinas, dwelling, as St Thomas 
loved to dwell, on the variety of creation and the differences of 
things, cannot but feel himself in face of the question, how all these 
differences arose; whether they were explicit in the first creation, or 
whether, out of a creation originally homogeneous, things came to be 
differentiated by a primitive plastic power, called Evolution, which 
has turned out an oak, or a sycamore, to be head and representative of 
one line of development, and a lion, or an eagle, of another. And, if 
he chooses Evolution, he will have to consider the part of God's 
providence therein.<p> 

This chapter should be read in the light of the teleological Psalm 
ciii, and of St Thomas's own declaration of his purpose in B. II, Chap. 
<A HREF="gc2_4.htm">IV</a>. In the untranslated portion occurs this 
curious aphorism: "The first thing aimed at in creatures is their 
multiplication (<i>prima ratio in creaturis est eorum numerositas</i>), 
and to the gaining and securing of this end all things else seem to be 
subordinate."<p>
