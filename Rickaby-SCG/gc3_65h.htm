Read <i>desitionis</i> (from <i>desino</i>) not <i>decisionis</i>. This
<i>accidens desitionis</i> may after all perhaps be no other
than the <i>forma cadaverica</i>, supposed by some school
men to replace the soul as the 'form' of the body
after death. These 'Moors' (Arabian commentators
on Aristotle) evidently were in possession of the
atomic theory of Leucippus and Democritus, a theory
embraced by Epicureans, but no favourite with
Aristotelians.
