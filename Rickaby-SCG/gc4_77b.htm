Holiness does not make the priest, nor does
wickedness unmake him: for <i>contrariorum eadem est
ratio</i>. By 'administration' here is meant 'valid administration,' 
not 'licit.' It is a mortal sin to administer
a Sacrament, being oneself in mortal sin. But that is
the affair of the minister, not of the recipient.
