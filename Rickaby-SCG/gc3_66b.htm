This is a bit of Platonism that has passed through
Aristotle to St Thomas. St Thomas gives the example
of fire being the cause of all things fiery. But there
is no essential element of fire, any more than there
is any essential beauty, outside of God. There is no
actual essential nature anywhere in creation. Thus
there is no actual essential humanity, by participation 
in which all men are men. Aristotle's doctrine
of the four elements, <i>fire</i> being essentially <i>hot</i>, <i>air</i>
essentially <i>cold</i>, <i>earth</i> essentially <i>dry</i>, and <i>water</i> 
essentially <i>moist</i>, is really a scheme of Platonic Ideas
operating as physical causes. For all his protests
against the Ideas, Aristotle never became quite
emancipated from their control.
