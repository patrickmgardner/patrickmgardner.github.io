So the imperfect and fickle beauties on earth
are reduced to the Self-Beauty. Upon this axiom Plato
constructed his theory of Ideas. And though the Ideas
were exaggerated and then discarded, the axiom held
its ground throughout the Middle Ages, and often
appears in St Thomas. The axiom has little vogue in
modern philosophy. It may be stated thus: 'There is
ever some perfect being somewhere at the back of the
imperfect.' The axiom is enforced with reference to
the Old Covenant, as compared with the New, in the
Epistle to the Hebrews ix and x. If I may add a
criticism, I should say that the axiom is more readily
apparent in exemplar causes than in efficient causes, --
not that I deny it of the latter. See
