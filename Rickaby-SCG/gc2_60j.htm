Plato's <b>thumos</b> and <b>epithumia</b>. Plato, curiously enough, 
makes no provision for the will, a neglect connected with his 
determinism. "Plato, following Socrates, is from first to last a 
thorough determinist: he always assumes that to know good is to do it: 
he never contemplates the case of a man looking away from the good that 
he knows, or failing to regard it steadily" (<i>Political and Moral 
Essays</i>, 249, 250).
