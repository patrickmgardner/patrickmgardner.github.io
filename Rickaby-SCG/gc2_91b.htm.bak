There is a vast lacuna in nature, if nothing in the scale of being 
intermediates between man and God.  It may be said that disembodied 
spirits so intermediate, especially if we allow, what St Thomas does 
not, that, once parted from the body, the soul expands into a perfect 
spiritual substance, with no remaining natural exigency of reunion with 
the body.  Yet even so, if spirits exist which have been in bodies, why 
not other spirits which never have been in bodies?  Throughout this 
argument we cannot travel beyond congruity.  For the fact of the 
existence of angels we require either experience, which we have not, or 
divine revelation, which we have.
