expressing some particular substance, as 'this steam,' the latter some 
particular quality, as 'the whiteness of these washed garments.'<p>

The argument lies open to this difficulty. -- Effects answer 
proportionally to their causes: but 'being, simply as such,' is an 
abstract effect: therefore it answers to an abstract cause: which 
argues the Creator to be an abstract Being: now abstract Being is mere 
mental fiction. -- St Thomas would not admit this Nominalist position, 
that abstract Being is mere mental fiction. Force, Energy, Work, Life, 
surely are not mere mental fictions, and yet they are abstract beings. 
Abstract Being does not exist as abstract: it is a reality in these and 
these particulars. St Thomas, in one place, if indeed the argument is 
really his, calls God an abstract Being: see B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_42.htm">XLII</a>, n. 13, with note. He means that God is a 
Being of ideal perfection. God is ideal Being, actualised: He is the 
actuality of ideality.<p>
