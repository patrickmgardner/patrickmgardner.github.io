<H1>That every Agent acts to some End</h1>

In the case of agents that manifestly act to some end, we call that the 
end to which the effort of the agent tends.  Gaining that, he is said 
to gain his end; and missing that, he is said to miss his intended end.  
Nor on this point does it make any difference whether the end be tended 
to with knowledge or not: for as the target is the end of the archer, 
so is it also the end of the path of the arrow.<A 
HREF="gc3_2a.htm">*</a>  The effort of every agent tends to some 
certain end.  Not any and every action can proceed from any and every 
power.  Action is sometimes terminated to some product, sometimes not.  
When action is terminated to some product, the effort of the agent 
tends to the same.  When action is not terminated to any product, the 
effort of the agent tends to the action itself.  Every agent therefore 
must intend some end in his action, sometimes the action itself, 
sometimes something produced by the action.<p> 

3. It is impossible for the chain of actions to extend to infinity: 
there must then be something, in the getting of which the effort of 
the agent comes to rest.  Therefore every agent acts to some end.<p>

6. Actions are open to criticism only so far as they are taken to be 
done as means to some end.  It is not imputed as a fault to any one, 
if he fails in effecting that for which his work is not intended.  A 
physician is found fault with if he fails in healing, but not a 
builder or a grammarian.  We find fault in points of art, as when a 
grammarian does not speak correctly; and also in points of nature, 
as in monstrous births.  Therefore both the natural agent, and the 
agent who acts according to art and with a conscious purpose, acts 
for an end.<p>

7. To an agent that did not tend to any definite effect, all effects 
would be indifferent.  But what is indifferent to many things, does 
not do one of them rather than another: hence from an agent open to 
both sides of an alternative (<i>a contingente ad utrumque</i>) 
there does not follow any effect, unless by some means it comes to 
be determined to one above the rest: otherwise it could not act at 
all.  Every agent therefore tends to some definite effect, and that 
is called its end.<p>

Still there are actions that do not seem to be for any end, as 
things done for sport, and acts of contemplation, and things done 
without advertence, as the stroking of the beard and the like: from 
which instances one may suppose that there is such a thing as an 
agent acting not for any end.  But we must observe that though acts 
of contempation are not for any other end, they are an end in 
themselves: as for things done in sport, sometimes they are their 
own end, as when one plays solely for the amusement that he finds 
in play; sometimes they are for an end, as when we play that 
afterwards we may resume work more vigorously: while things done 
without advertence may proceed not from the understanding, but from 
some phantasy or physical principle; yet even these acts tend to 
certain ends, though beyond the scope of the intellect of the agent.<p>

Hereby is banished the error of certain ancient natural philosophers 
(Empedocles and Democritus, mentioned in Aristotle, <i>Physics</i> 
II, ii, 6) who supposed all things to happen by necessity of matter, 
and eliminated final causes from the universe.
