<H1>That there is no Habitual Knowledge in God</h1>

IN whatever minds there is habitual knowledge, not all things are known 
together: but some things are known actually, others habitually. But in 
God all things are known actually (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_55.htm">LV</a>). 
<P>

2. He who has a habit of knowledge, and is not adverting to what he 
knows, is in a manner in potentiality, although otherwise than as he 
was before he understood at all: but the divine mind is nowise in 
potentiality.<P>

3. In every mind that knows anything habitually, the mind's essence is 
different from its intellectual activity, which is the act of attentive 
thought. To such a mind, in habitual knowledge, activity is lacking, 
though the essence of the mind itself cannot be lacking.<A 
HREF="gc1_56a.htm">*</a> But in God His essence is His activity (Chap. 
<A HREF="gc1_45.htm">XLV</a>).<P>

4. A mind that knows habitually only, is not in its ultimate perfection:
hence that best of goods, happiness, is not taken to be in habit but in act.  
If then God is habitually knowing, He will not be all-perfect (contrary to
Chap. <A HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>).<P>

5. As shown in chapter <A HREF="gc1_46.htm">XLVI</a>, God has 
understanding by His essence, not by any intelligible forms superadded 
to His essence.  But every mind in habitual knowledge understands by 
some such forms: for a habit is either a predisposition of the mind to 
receive mental impressions, or forms, whereby it comes actually to 
understand; or it is an orderly aggregation of such forms, existing in 
the mind, not in complete actuality, but in some manner intermediate 
between potentiality and actuality.<A HREF="gc1_56b.htm">*</a><P> 

6. A habit is a quality: but in God there can be neither quality nor 
any other accident (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_23.htm">XXIII</a>): habitual 
knowledge therefore is not proper to God. Because the mental state of 
thinking, or willing, or acting habitually only, is like the state of a 
sleeper, David says, by way of removing all habitual states from God: 
<i>Lo, he shall not slumber or sleep who keepeth Israel</i> (Ps. cxx, 
4).  And again it is said: <i>The eyes of the Lord are far brighter 
than the sun</i> (Ecclus xxiii, 28), for the sun is always in the act 
of shining.
