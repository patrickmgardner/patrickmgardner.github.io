<H1>How Likeness to God may be found in Creatures</h1>

EFFECTS disproportionate to their causes do not agree with them in name and 
essence. And yet some likeness must be found between such effects and their 
causes: for it is of the nature of an agent to do something like itself. 
Thus also God gives to creatures all their perfections; and thereby He has 
with all creatures a likeness, and an unlikeness at the same time. For this 
point of likeness, however, it is more proper to say that the creature is 
like God than that God is like the creature. For that is said to be like a 
thing, which possesses its quality or form. Since then that which is found 
to perfection in God is found in other beings by some manner of imperfect 
participation, the said point of likeness belongs to God absolutely, but not 
so to the creature. And thus the creature has what belongs to God, and is 
rightly said to be like to God: but it cannot be said that God has what 
belongs to the creature, nor is it fitting to say that God is like the 
creature; as we do not say that a man is like his picture, and yet his 
picture is rightly pronounced to be like him.
