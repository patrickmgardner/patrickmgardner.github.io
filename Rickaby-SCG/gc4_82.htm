<h1>That Men shall rise again Immortal</h1>

THAT cannot be said to have been destroyed, which is to go on for ever. 
If then men were to rise again always with the prospect of another 
death, in no way could death be said to have been destroyed by the 
death of Christ. But it has been destroyed, -- for the present, 
causally, as was foretold: <i>I will be thy death, O death (Osee xiii, 
14): and in the end it shall be destroyed actually: <i>the last enemy 
to be destroyed is death</i> (i Cor. xv, 26).<p> 

3. The effect is like its cause. But the resurrection of Christ is the 
cause of our resurrection; and <i>Christ rising from  the dead dieth now 
no more</i> (Rom. vi, 9).<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>The Lord shall cast out death for ever</i> (Isa. 
xxv, 8): <i>Death shall be no more</i> (Apoc. xxi, 24).<p> 

Hereby entrance is denied to the error of certain Gentiles of old, who 
believed that times and temporal events recurred in cycles. For 
example, in that age one Plato, a philosopher in the city of Athens, 
and in the school that is called Academic, taught his scholars thus, 
that in the course of countless revolving ages, recurring at long but 
fixed intervals, the same Plato, and the same city, and the same 
school, and the same scholars would recur, and so would be repeated 
again and again in the course of countless ages.<A

same that shall be. There is nothing new under the sun: nor can any one 
say, Lo, this is fresh: for it hath already gone before in the ages 
that have preceded us</i> (Eccles i, 9): it is to be understood of 
events like in kind, but not in number.<A HREF="gc4_82b.htm">*</a>
