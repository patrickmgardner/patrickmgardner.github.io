<H1>That they who see God will see Him for ever</h1>

WHATEVER now is, and now is not, is measured by time. But the vision 
that makes the happiness of intellectual creatures is not in time, but 
in eternity (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_61.htm">LXI</a>). It is impossible 
therefore that from the moment one becomes partaker of it he should 
ever lose it.<p>

2. An intelligent creature does not arrive at its last end except when 
its natural desire is set at rest. But as it naturally desires 
happiness, so it naturally desires perpetuity of happiness: for, being 
perpetual in its substance, whatever thing it desires for the thing's 
own sake, and not for the sake of something else, it desires as a thing 
to be had for ever.<A HREF="gc3_62a.htm">*</a> Happiness therefore would 
not be the last end, if it did not endure perpetually.<p> 

3. Everything that is loved in the having of it brings sadness, if we 
know that at some time we must part with it. But the beatific vision, 
being of all things most delightful and most desired, is of all things 
most loved by them who have it. They could not therefore be otherwise 
than saddened, if they knew that at some time they were to lose it. But 
if it were not meant to last for ever, they would be aware of the fact: 
for in seeing the divine substance, they also see other things that 
naturally are (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_59.htm">LIX</a>).<A 
HREF="gc3_62b.htm">*</a><p>

6. It is impossible for one to wish to resign a good thing that he 
enjoys, except for some evil that he discerns in the enjoyment of that 
good, or because he reckons it a hindrance to greater good. But in the 
enjoyment of the beatific vision there can be no evil, since it is the 
best thing to which an intelligent creature can attain: nor can he who 
enjoys that vision possibly think that there is any evil in it, or 
anything better than it, since the vision of that sovereign truth 
excludes all false judgement.<A HREF="gc3_62c.htm">*</a><p>  

5. Nothing that is viewed with wonder can grow tedious: as long as it 
is an object of wonder, the desire of seeing it remains. But the divine 
substance is always viewed with wonder by any created intelligence, 
since no created intelligence can comprehend it. Therefore such 
intelligence can never find that vision tedious.<p> 

9. The nearer a thing comes to God, who is wholly unchangeable, the 
less changeable it is and the more enduring. But no creature can draw 
nearer to God than that which beholds His substance. The intelligent 
creature then gains in the vision of God a certain immutability, and 
cannot fall from that vision.<p>

Hence it is said: <i>Blessed are they who dwell in thy house, O Lord: 
they shall praise thee for ever and ever</i> (Ps. lxxxiii, 5): <i>He 
shall never be moved from his place, that dwelleth in Jerusalem 
</i>(Ps. cxxiv, 1): <i>Whoever shall overcome, I will make him a pillar 
in the temple of my God, and he shall not go out any more</i> (Apoc. 
iii, 12).
