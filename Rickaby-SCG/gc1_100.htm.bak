<H1>That God is Happy</h1>

HAPPINESS is the proper good of every intellectual nature. Since then 
God is an intellectual being, happiness will be His proper good. 
But God in regard of His proper good is not as a being that is still
tending to a proper good not yet possessed: that is the way with a nature
changeable and in potentiality; but God is in the position of a being that
already possesses its proper good. Therefore He not only desires happiness,
as we do, but is in the enjoyment of happiness.<p>

2. The thing above all others desired or willed by an intellectual 
nature is the most perfect thing in that nature, and that is its 
happiness.  But the most perfect thing in each is its most perfect 
activity: for power and habit are perfected by activity: hence the 
Philosopher says that happiness is a perfect activity.<A 
HREF="gc1_100a.htm">*</a> Now the perfection of activity depends on four 
conditions.  First, on its kind, that it be immanent in the agent. I 
call an activity 'immanent in the agent,' when nothing else comes of it 
besides the act itself: such are the acts of seeing and hearing: such 
acts are perfections of the agents whose acts they are, and may have a 
finality of their own in so far as they are not directed to the 
production of anything else as an end.  On the other hand, any activity 
from which there results something done besides itself, is a perfection 
of the thing done, not of the doer: it stands in the relation of a 
means to an end, and therefore cannot be the happiness of an 
intellectual nature.  Secondly, on the principle of activity, that it 
be an activity of the highest power: hence our happiness lies not in 
any activity of sense, but in an activity of intellect, perfected by 
habit. Thirdly, on the object of activity; and therefore our happiness 
consists in understanding the highest object of understanding.  
Fourthly, on the form of activity, that the action be perfect, easy, 
and agreeable.  But the activity of God fulfils all these conditions: 
since it is (1) activity in the order of understanding; and (2) His 
understanding is the highest of faculties, not needing any habit to 
perfect it; and (3) His understanding is bent upon Himself, the highest 
of intelligible objects; and (4) He understands perfectly, without any 
difficulty, and with all delight. He is therefore happy.<p> 

3. Boethius says that happiness is a state made perfect by a gathering 
of all good things.  But such is the divine perfection, which includes 
all perfection in one single view (Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>, <A HREF="gc1_54.htm">LIV</a>).<p> 

4. He is happy, who is sufficient for himself and wants nothing.  But
God has no need of other things, seeing that His perfection depends on 
nothing external to Himself; and when He wills other things for Himself as
for an end, it is not that He needs them, but only that this reference befits
His goodness.<p>

5. It is impossible for God to wish for anything impossible (Chap.  <A 
HREF="gc1_84.htm">LXXXIV</a>).  Again it is impossible for anything to 
come in to Him which as yet He has not, seeing that He is nowise in 
potentiality (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_16.htm">XVI</a>).  Therefore He cannot 
wish to have what He has not: therefore He has whatever He wishes; and 
He wishes nothing evil (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_95.htm">XCV</a>). Therefore 
He is happy, according to the definition given by some, that "he is 
happy who has what he wishes and wishes nothing evil." His happiness 
the Holy Scriptures declare: <i>Whom he will show in his own time, the 
blessed and powerful one (i Tim. vi, 15).
