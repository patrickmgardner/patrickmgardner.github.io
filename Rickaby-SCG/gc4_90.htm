<h1>How Incorporeal Subsistent Spirits suffer from Corporeal Fire, and 
are befittingly punished with Corporeal Punishments</h1> 

WE must not suppose that incorporeal subsistent spirits, -- as the 
devil, and the souls of the lost before the resurrection, -- can suffer 
from fire any disintegration of their physical being, or other change, 
such as our perishable bodies suffer from fire. For incorporeal 
substances have not a corporeal nature, to be changed by corporeal 
things. Nor are they susceptible of sensible forms except 
intellectually; and such intellectual impression is not penal, but 
rather perfective and pleasurable.<A HREF="gc4_90a.htm">*</a> Nor can 
it be said that they suffer affliction from corporeal fire by reason of 
a certain contrariety,<A HREF="gc4_90b.htm">*</a> as their bodies shall 
suffer after the resurrection: for incorporeal subsistent spirits have 
no organs of sense nor the use of sensory powers. Such spirits shall 
suffer then from corporeal fire by a sort of <i>constriction 
(alligatio)</i>. For spirits can be tied to bodies, either as their 
form, as the soul is tied to the human body to give it life; or without 
being the body's form, as magicians by diabolic power tie spirits to 
images.<A HREF="gc4_90c.htm">*</a> Much more by divine power may 
spirits under damnation be tied to corporeal fire; and this is an 
affliction to them to know that they are tied to the meanest creatures 
for punishment.<A HREF="gc4_90d.htm">*</a><p> 

1. Every sin of the rational creature comes of its not submitting in 
obedience to God. Now punishment ought to correspond and be in 
proportion to offence, so that the will may be penally afflicted by 
enduring something the very reverse of what it sinfully loved. 
Therefore it is a proper punishment for a sinful rational nature to 
find itself subject by a sort of 'constriction' to bodily things 
inferior to itself.<p> 

2. The pain of sense answers to the offence in respect of its being an 
inordinate turning to some changeable good, as the pain of loss answers 
to the offence in respect of its being a turning away from the 
Unchangeable Good (B. III, Chap. <A HREF="gc3_146.htm">CXLVI</a>). But 
the rational creature, and particularly the human soul, sins by 
inordinate turning to bodily things. Therefore it is a befitting 
punishment for it to be afflicted by bodily things.<p> 

Though the promises in Scripture of corporal rewards, like meat and 
drink (Isai. xxv, 6: lxv, 13: Luke xxii, 29: Apoc. xxii, 2), for the 
Blessed, are to be taken in a spiritual sense, nevertheless some 
corporal punishments, with which the wicked are threatened in 
Scripture, are to be understood as corporal punishments in the proper 
sense of the terms used. For though it is not becoming for a higher 
nature to be rewarded by the use of something inferior to itself: 
rather its reward should consist in union with something higher than 
itself: nevertheless the punishment of a superior nature may fittingly 
consist in its being rated with things inferior to it. Some, however, 
of the corporeal imagery that we find in Scripture, speaking of the 
pains of the lost, may very well be interpreted in a spiritual and 
figurative sense. Thus in the saying, <i>Their worm dieth not</i> 
(Isai. lxvi, 24: Mark ix, 44), by the worm may be understood the 
remorse of conscience with which the wicked will be tormented: for it 
is impossible for a material worm to gnaw a spiritual substance, or so 
much as the bodies of the damned, which will be imperishable. 
<i>Weeping and gnashing of teeth</i> too (Matt. xiii, 42) can only be 
understood metaphorically of subsistent spirits; although in the bodies 
of the lost after the resurrection the phrase may be taken to have its 
bodily fulfilment, -- not that there can be any flow of tears, for there 
can be no secretion from such bodies, but the weeping will mean pain 
of heart, trouble of eyes and head, and such usual accompaniments of 
weeping.
