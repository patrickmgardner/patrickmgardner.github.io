<H1>That Reason can be assigned for the Divine Will<A 
HREF="gc1_86a.htm">*</a></h1>

THE end is a reason for willing the means. But God wills His own 
goodness as an end, and all things else as means thereto: His goodness 
therefore is a reason why He wills other things different from 
Himself.<p> 

2. The good of a part is ordained to the end of the good of the whole, 
as the imperfect to the perfect.  But things become objects of the 
divine will according as they stand in the order of goodness. It 
follows that the good of the universe is the reason why God wills every 
good of any part of the universe.<p> 

3. Supposing that God wills anything, it follows of necessity that He 
wills the means requisite thereto. But what lays on others a necessity 
for doing a thing, is a reason for doing it. Therefore the 
accomplishment of a purpose, to which such and such means are 
requisite, is a reason to God for willing those means.<p> 

We may therefore proceed as follows. God wishes man to have reason, to 
the end that he may be man: He wishes man to be, to the end of the 
completion of the universe: He wishes the good of the universe to be, 
because it befits His own goodness.<a href="gc1_86b.htm">*</a> The same 
proportion however is not observable in all three stages of this 
ratiocination. The divine goodness does not depend on the perfection of 
the universe, and receives no accession thereby.  The perfection of the 
universe, though depending necessarily on the good of some particular 
components, which are essential parts of the universe, has no necessary 
dependence on others, although even from them some goodness or beauty 
accrues to the universe, such things serving solely for the 
fortification (<i>munimentum</i>) or embellishment of the rest. But any 
particular good depends absolutely on the elements that are requisite 
to it: and still even such goods have adjuncts that go merely to better 
their condition. Sometimes therefore the reason of the divine will 
involves mere becomingness, sometimes utility, sometimes also 
hypothetical necessity, but never absolute necessity, except when the 
object of God's volition is God Himself.
