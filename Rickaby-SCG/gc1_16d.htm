'Every agent acts inasmuch as it is in actuality,'
is a favourite axiom of the schoolmen, to which there
is a reciprocal: 'Everything that is acted upon is
acted upon inasmuch as it is in potentiality': which
is also put thus, 'Everything received is received 
according to the mode of the recipient.' 'To be in
actuality,' is something akin to the modern conception
of 'energy.' Every agent then acts according to its
proximately available energy.  A man does only what
he is 'up to doing.'
