<i>De anima</i>, I, v, 29, where Aristotle seems to assume that 
intellect is a part, <b>morion</b>, of the soul. Averroes however might 
have replied that is a mere <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> against Plato, 
who did suppose so.  In n. 25 however Aristotle says clearly, <b>to 
gin&ocirc;skein t&ecirc;s psuch&ecirc;s esti k.t.l.</b>, which see.  
But Aristotle is so careless a writer, so regardless of his own 
injunctions and definitions, that the minute analysis of his language, 
far from settling a point, may be positively misleading.  In reading 
him you have often to think, not so much of what he says, as of what on 
his own showing he should say.<p> 

When St Thomas teaches that the soul is the form of the body by its 
substance, but not by the faculty of intelligence, he supposes a real 
distinction between the soul and its faculties, a distinction not 
admitted by the earlier scholastics, sometimes called 'Augustinians.'  
In his ruling that the intelligence has no corporeal organ, one 
naturally thinks of the brain. But the brain, in the Aristotelian 
system, had quite another function; it acted as a refrigerator to cool 
down the vital heat of the body.  See the curious chapter, <i>De 
partibus animalium</i>, II, 7.  St Thomas however assigned to the brain 
some share in sensory processes: see <i>De potentiis animae</i>, cap. 
iv, quoted in Dr Maher's <i>Psychology</i>, pp. 568-9, ed. 4.
