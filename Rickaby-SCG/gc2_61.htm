<H1>That the aforesaid Tenet is contrary to the Mind of Aristotle</h1>

ARISTOTLE defines soul, "the first actuality of a natural, organic 
body, potentially alive"; and adds, "this definition applies 
universally to every soul." Nor does he, as the aforesaid Averroes 
pretends, put forth this latter remark in a tentative way, as may be 
seen from the Greek copies and the translation of Boethius. Afterwards 
in the same chapter he adds that there are "certain parts of the soul 
separable," and these are none other than the intellectual parts. The 
conclusion remains that the said parts are actualisations of the 
body.<A HREF="gc2_61a.htm">*</a><p> 

2. Nor is this explanation inconsistent with Aristotle's words 
subjoined: "About the intellect and the speculative faculty the case is 
not yet clear: but it seems to be another kind of soul."<A 
HREF="gc2_61b.htm">*</a> He does not hereby mean to separate the 
intellect from the common definition of 'soul,' but from the peculiar 
natures of the other parts of soul: as one who says that fowls are a 
different sort of animal from land animals, does not take away from the 
fowl the common definition of 'animal.' Hence, to show in what respect 
he called it "another kind," he adds: "And of this alone is there 
possibility of separation, as of the everlasting from the perishable." 
Nor is it the intention of Aristotle, as the Commentator aforesaid 
pretends, to say that it is not yet clear whether intellect be soul at 
all, as it is clear of other and lower vital principles. For the old 
text has not, "Nothing has been declared," or "Nothing has been said," 
but "Nothing is clear," which is to be understood as referring to the 
peculiar properties of intellect, not to the general definition (of 
soul). But if, as the Commentator says, the word 'soul' is used not in 
the same sense of intellect and other varieties, Aristotle would have 
first distinguished the ambiguity and then made his definition, as his 
manner is: otherwise his argument would rest on an ambiguity, an 
intolerable procedure in demonstrative sciences.<p>

3. Aristotle reckons 'intellect' among the 'faculties' of the soul.<A 
HREF="gc2_61c.htm">*</a> Also, in the passage last quoted, he names 
'the speculative faculty.' Intellect therefore is not outside the human 
soul, but is a faculty thereof.<p> 

4. Also, when beginning to speak of the potential intellect, he calls 
it a part of the soul, saying: "Concerning the part of the soul whereby 
the soul has knowledge and intellectual consciousness."<A 
HREF="gc2_61d.htm">*</a><p>

5. And still more clearly by what follows, declaring the nature of the 
potential intellect: "I call intellect that whereby the soul thinks and 
under stands":<A HREF="gc2_61e.htm">*</a> in which it is manifestly 
shown that the intellect is something belonging to the human soul.<p>

The above  tenet (of Averroes) therefore is contrary to the mind of 
Aristotle and contrary to the truth: hence it should be rejected as 
chimerical.<A HREF="gc2_61f.htm">*</a>
