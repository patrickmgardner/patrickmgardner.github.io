<H1>How the aforesaid Relations are predicated of God</h1> 

It cannot be said that the aforesaid relations are things existing 
outside of God.<A HREF="gc2_13a.htm">*</a> For since God is first of 
beings and highest of excellencies, we should have to consider other 
relations of God to those relations, supposing them to be things; and 
if the second relations again were things, we should have to invent 
again a third set of relations, and so on to infinity.<A 
HREF="gc2_13b.htm">*</a> Again, there are two ways in which a 
denomination may be predicated. A thing is denominated from what is 
outside it, as from place a man is said to be 'somewhere,' and from 
time 'once'; and again a thing is denominated from what is within it, 
as 'white' from whiteness. But from relation nothing is found to bear a 
denomination as from something outside itself, but only as from 
something within itself: thus a man is not called 'father' except from 
the paternity that is in him. It is impossible therefore for the 
relations, whereby God has relation to the creature, to be anything 
outside God. Since then it has been shown that they are not in Him 
really and yet are predicated of Him, the only possible conclusion is 
that they are attributed to Him merely by our mode of thought, inasmuch 
as other beings are in relation to Him: for when our understanding 
conceives that A is related to B, it further conceives that B is 
related to A, even though sometimes B is not really so related.<p> 

Hence it is also clear that the aforesaid relations are not predicated 
of God in the same way that other things are predicated of God: for all 
other things, as wisdom or will, are predicated of His essence, while 
the aforesaid relations are by no means so predicated, but only 
according to our mode of thought. And yet our thought is not at fault: 
for, by the very fact of our mind knowing that the relations of effects 
of divine power have God himself for their term it predicates some 
things of Him relatively.<p>
