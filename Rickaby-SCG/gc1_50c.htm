St. Thomas does not use the word <i>collocatio</i>.
His repeated phrase is <i>distinctio rerum</i>, which I have
rendered 'distinct arrangement and collocation,' first,
because such is really the meaning, and, secondly, 
because this argument has attracted attention, and been
acknowledged to have weight, in respect of what is
called the 'primitive collocation' of the materials of
the universe, a collocation impossible to explain by
any physical causation, and pointing evidently to some
ordering and disposing Intelligence.
