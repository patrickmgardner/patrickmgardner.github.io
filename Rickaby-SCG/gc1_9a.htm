I invite the reader, especially if he be an 
'adversary,' carefully to read this sentence and bear it
in mind throughout the book.  The arguments 
alleged are never fanciful or frivolous, if you 
understand them, except where they involve some 
mediaeval ignorance of physics, cases usually omitted in this
translation.  But they frequently fall short 
of demonstration, as their author was well aware, who was
often content with probabilities.
