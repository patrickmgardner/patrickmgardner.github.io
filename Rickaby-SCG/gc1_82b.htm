God in willing His own goodness is not thereby 
necessitated to will the existence of, let us say, St
Augustine, as though, if there were no Augustine, the
goodness of God would be incomplete. This argument 
of God's absolute self-sufficiency, His supreme
independence of creation, and consequent perfect
liberty to create or not, is, I am informed, the tenet
of some at least of the wisest Brahmins of India.
