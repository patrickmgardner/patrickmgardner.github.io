And the higher the effect, the fuller the presence. There is more of 
God in the war-horse than in the worm, more of Him in mind than in 
matter; and, what is to the point here, there is a presence of God in 
the just which is denied to the wicked, the presence that goes with 
sanctifying grace (B. III, Chapp. <A HREF="gc3_151.htm">CLI</a>, <A
