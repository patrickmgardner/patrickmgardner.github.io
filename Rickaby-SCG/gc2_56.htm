<H1>How a Subsistent Intelligence may be united with a Body, with a 
Solution of the Arguments alleged to prove that a Subsistent 
Intelligence cannot be united with a Body as its Form</h1>

A SUBSISTENT intelligence Cannot be united with a body by any manner of 
combination: for combined elements, when the combination is complete, 
do not remain actually, but virtually only: for if they remained 
actually, it would not be a combination, but a mere mechanical 
mixture.<A HREF="gc2_56a.htm">*</a>  But this combination and 
consequent cessation of actual existence cannot befall subsistent 
intelligences; for they are imperishable.<p> 

It is likewise evident that a subsistent intelligence cannot be united 
with a body by any manner of contact, properly so called. For contact 
is only of bodies: those things are in contact, the extremities of 
which are together,<A HREF="gc2_56b.htm">*</a> as points, or lines, or 
circumferences, which are the extremities of bodies.<p>

Still there is one mode of contact whereby a subsistent intelligence 
may be mingled with a body. For natural bodies in touching one another 
involve a change, and  thus are united together, not only in their 
quantitative extremities, but also by likeness of one same quality or 
form, the one in pressing its form on the other. And though, if we 
regard only quantitative extremities, the contact must be mutual in all 
cases, yet, if we consider action and passion, there will be found some 
cases of touching without being touched, and some cases of being 
touched without touching. Any cases that may be found of contact without 
contact in quantitative extremities must still be ca]led instances of 
contact, inasmuch as they are instances of action: thus we say that he 
who saddens another 'touches' him.<A HREF="gc2_56c.htm">*</a> According 
to this mode of touch it is possible for a subsistent intelligence to 
be united to a body by contact: for subsistent intelligences act upon 
bodies and move them, being more highly actualised than bodies are.<A 
HREF="gc2_56d.htm">*</a><p>

This contact is not quantitative but virtual, and differs from bodily 
contact in three respects. First, because in this contact the 
indivisible can touch the divisible, which cannot happen in bodily 
contact: for only that which is indivisible can be touched by a 
point,<A HREF="gc2_56e.htm">*</a> whereas a subsistent intelligence, 
indivisible though it be, can touch a divisible quantity by acting upon 
it. The point and the subsistent intelligence are not indivisible in 
the same way. The point is indivisible as a term of quantity, and has a 
definite situation in a continuous surface, beyond which it cannot be 
thrown:<A HREF="gc2_56f.htm">*</a> whereas a subsistent intelligence is 
indivisible by being outside of the category of quantity altogether: 
hence no indivisible element of quantity is marked out for contact with 
it. Secondly, because quantitative contact is only with extremities, 
but virtual contact is with the whole subject touched: for the subject 
is touched inasmuch as it is acted upon and moved; but that is inasmuch 
as it is in potentiality; and potentiality extends to the whole, not 
merely to the extremities of the whole: hence the whole is touched. 
From this appears a third difference: because in quantitative touch, 
which is of extremities, the touching body must be outside of the 
touched, and cannot pervade it, but is stopped by it;<A 
HREF="gc2_56g.htm">*</a> whereas the virtual contact, which is proper 
to subsistent intelligences, reaching to the inmost recesses of things, 
makes the touching substance be within the touched and pervade it 
without let or hindrance. Thus then a subsistent intelligence may be 
united with a body by virtual contact.<A HREF="gc2_56h.htm">*</a><p> 

Elements united by such contact are not absolutely one: they are one in 
action and in being acted upon, which does not involve absolute oneness 
of being. Such absolute oneness may be in three ways: in the way of 
indivisibility, in the way of continuity, and in the way of natural 
unity. Now out of a subsistent intelligence and a body there cannot be 
made an indivisible unity: it must be a compound of two things. Nor 
again a continuous unity, because the parts of a continuum are 
quantitative. It remains to be enquired whether out of a subsistent 
intelligence and a body there can result such a unity as means oneness 
of nature.<A HREF="gc2_56i.htm">*</a> But out of two permanent elements 
there results no being one by nature except that which results of the 
union of substantial form with matter: for out of substance and 
accident there results no being one by nature, for the nature or 
essence of 'man' and 'whiteness' is not the same.<A 
HREF="gc2_56j.htm">*</a> This question then remains to be studied, 
whether a subsistent intelligence can be the substantial form of any 
body. Looking at the matter argumentatively, it might seem that the 
thing is impossible.<p>

<i>Arg. 1.</i> Of two actually existent substances no one being can be 
made: for the actuality of every being is that whereby it is 
distinguished from another being. But a subsistent intelligence is an 
actually existing substance: so likewise is a body. Apparently 
therefore no one being can be made of a subsistent intelligence and a 
body.<p>

<i>Arg. 2.</i> Form and matter are contained under the same genus: for 
every genus is divided into actual and potential. But a subsistent 
intelligence and a body are of different genera.<p>

<i>Arg. 3.</i> All that is in matter must be material. But if 
subsistent intelligence is the form of a body, the being of such 
intelligence must be in matter: for there is no being of the form 
beyond the being of the matter. It follows that a subsistent 
intelligence could not be immaterial, as supposed.<p>

<i>Arg. 4.</i> It is impossible for anything having its being in a 
body to be apart from the body. But intelligence is shown to be apart 
from the body, as it is neither the body itself nor a bodily faculty.<A 
HREF="gc2_56k.htm">*</a><p>

<i>Arg. 5.</i> Whatever has being in common with the body, must also 
have activity in common with the body: for the active power of a thing 
cannot be more exalted than its essence. But if a subsistent 
intelligence is the form of a body, one being must be common to it and 
the body: for out of form and matter there results absolute unity, 
which is unity in being. At that rate the activity of a subsistent 
intelligence, united as a form to the body, will be exerted in common 
with the body, and its faculty will be a bodily (or organic) faculty: 
positions which we regard as impossible.<p>

(Chap. LXIX). It is not difficult to solve the objections alleged 
against the aforesaid union.<p>

<i>Reply 1</i>. The first objection contains a false supposition: for 
body and soul are not two actually existing substances, but out of the 
two of them is made one substance actually existing: for a man's body 
is not the same in actuality when the soul is present as when it is 
absent: it is the soul that gives actual being.<A 
HREF="gc2_56l.htm">*</a><p>

<i>Reply 2.</i> As for the second objection, that form and matter are 
contained under the same genus, it is not true in the sense that both 
are species of one genus, but inasmuch as both are elements of the same 
species. Thus then a subsistent intelligence and a body, which as 
separate existences would be species of different genera, in their 
union belong to one genus as elements of the same.<p>

<i>Reply 3.</i> Nor need a subsistent intelligence be a 
material form, notwithstanding that its existence is in matter: for 
though in matter, it is not immersed in matter, or wholly comprised 
in matter.<p>

<i>Rep!y 4.</i> Nor yet does the union of a subsistent intelligence 
with a body by its being that body's form stand in the way of 
intelligence being separable from body.<A HREF="gc2_56m.htm">*</a> In a 
soul we have to observe as well its essence as also its power. In point 
of essence it gives being to such and such a body, while in point of 
power it executes its own proper acts. In any activity of the soul 
therefore which is completed by a bodily organ, the power of the soul 
which is the principle of that activity must bring to act that part of 
the body whereby its activity is completed, as sight brings the eye to 
act. But in any activity of the soul that we may suppose not to be 
completed by any bodily organ, the corresponding power will not bring 
anything in the body to act; and this is the sense in which the 
intellect is said to be 'separate,' -- not but that the substance of 
the soul, whereof intellect is a power, or the intellectual soul, 
brings the body to act, inasmuch as it is the form which gives being to 
such body.<p> 

<i>Reply 5.</i> Nor is it necessary, as was argued in the fifth place, 
that if the soul in its substance is the form of the body, its every 
operation should be through the body, and thus its every faculty should 
be the actuation of some part of the body: for the human soul is not 
one of those forms which are entirely immersed in matter, but of all 
forms it is the most exalted above matter: hence it is capable of a 
certain activity without the body, being not dependent on the body in 
its action, as neither in its being is it dependent on the body.<p>
