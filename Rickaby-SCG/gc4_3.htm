<H1>That the Son of God is God</h1>

WE must not however fail to observe that divine Scripture uses the 
above names also to denote the creation of things: thus it is said: 
<i>Who is the father of rain? or who hath begotten the drops of dew? 
From whose womb hath ice gone forth, and who hath begotten the frost 
from heaven?</i> (Job xxxvlli, 28.) Lest then by these names of 
paternity, sonship, and generation, nothing further should be 
understood than an act of creative energy, Scripture has further not 
failed to call Him God also, whom it has named <i>Son</i> and 
<i>Begotten</i>, -- John i, 1, 14   Titus iii, 11 : Ps. xliv, 7, 8 
[Heb. i, 8, 9] : Isa. ix, 6. And that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, 
Peter confessed, Matt. xvi, 16.
