<H1>That Man stands in need of Divine Grace for the Gaining of 
Happiness</h1>

IT has already been shown (Chapp. CXI - <A 
HREF="gc3_112.htm">[CXII]</a> - <A HREF="gc3_113.htm">CXIII</a>) that 
divine providence disposes of rational creatures otherwise than of 
other things, inasmuch as their nature stands on a different footing 
from that of others. It remains to be shown that also in view of the 
dignity of their end divine providence employs a higher method of 
government in their regard. Their nature clearly fits them for a higher 
end. As being intelligent, they can attain to intelligible truth, which 
other creatures cannot. So far as they attain this truth by their own 
natural activity, God provides for them otherwise than for other 
creatures, giving them understanding and reason, and further the gift 
of speech, whereby they can aid one another in the knowledge of truth. 
But beyond this, the last end of man is fixed in a certain knowledge of 
truth which exceeds his natural faculties, so that it is given to him 
to see the First Truth in itself.<A HREF="gc3_148a.htm>*</a> To 
creatures lower than man it is not given to arrive at an end exceeding 
the capacities of their natures. In view of this end, a method of 
government must be found for man, different from that which suffices 
for the lower creation. For the means must be proportionate to the end: 
if then man is ordained to an end transcending his natural capacities, 
he must be furnished with some supernatural assistance from heaven, 
enabling him to tend to that end.<p> 

2. A thing of inferior nature cannot be brought to that which is proper 
to a superior nature except by the virtue and action of the said 
superior nature. Thus the moon, which has no light of its own, is made 
luminous by the virtue and action of the sun.<A 
HREF="gc3_148b.htm>*</a> But to behold the First Truth as it is in 
itself so transcends the capacity of human nature as to be proper to 
God alone (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_52.htm">LII</a>). Therefore man needs 
help of God to arrive at such an end.<p> 

5. There are many impediments in the way of man's arriving at his end. 
He is impeded by the weakness of his reason, which is easily dragged 
into error, and so erring he is thrown off the right way of arriving at 
his end. He is impeded by the passions of the sensitive portion of his 
nature, and by the tastes which drag him to sensible and inferior 
things. The more he clings to such things, the further he is separated 
from his last end: for these things are below man, whereas his end is 
high above him. He is impeded also very frequently by infirmity of body 
from the performance of the acts of virtue which carry him on to his 
end. Man therefore needs the divine assistance, lest with such 
impediments in his way, he fail altogether in the gaining of his last 
end.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>No man can come to me, unless the Father, who hath 
sent me, draw him</i> (John vi, 44): <i>As the branch cannot bear fruit 
of itself unless it abide in the vine, so neither can ye unless ye 
abide in me</i> (John xv, 4).<A HREF="gc3_148c.htm>*</a><p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of the Pelagians, who said that man could 
merit the glory of God by sheer free will of his own.
