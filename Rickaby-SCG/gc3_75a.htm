The tree holds on to its fruit, so far as it can,
and only sheds it spontaneously when it is ripe.
Dumb animals care for their young till they are old
enough to shift for themselves. Human love and
solicitude for children endure as long as life lasts, --
and not only for children, but for artistic creations
of hand and mind. But God is of all living things
the best, according to the Aristotelian definition
(<i>Metaph.</i> XII, vii). He may be expected therefore to
be more careful of His creatures than the tree of its
fruit, than the animal of its young, than parent of
child, than artist of his work.
