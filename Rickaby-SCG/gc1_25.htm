<H1>That God is not in any Genus</h1>

EVERYTHING that is in any genus has something in it whereby the nature 
of the genus is characterised and reduced to species: for there is 
nothing in the genus that is not in some species of it. But this is 
impossible in God, as has been shown in the previous chapter.<P> 

2. If God is in any genus, He is either in the genus of accident or the 
genus of substance. He is not in the genus of accident, for an accident 
cannot be the first being and the first cause. Again, He cannot be in 
the genus of substance: for the substance that is a genus is not mere 
existence<A HREF="gc1_25a.htm">*</a>: otherwise every substance would 
be its own existence, since the idea of the genus is maintained in all 
that is contained under the genus: at that rate no substance would be 
caused by another, which is impossible (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_13.htm">XIII</a>, <A HREF="gc1_15.htm">XV</a>). But God is 
mere existence: therefore He is not in any genus.<P> 

3. Whatever is in a genus differs in point of existence from other 
things that are in the same genus: otherwise genus would not be 
predicated of several things. But all things that are in the same genus 
must agree in the quiddity, or essence, of the genus: because of them 
all genus is predicated so as to answer the question what (quid) each 
thing is.<A HREF="gc1_25b.htm">*</a> Therefore the existence of each 
thing that exists in a genus is something over and above the quiddity 
of the genus.  But that is impossible in God.<A 
HREF="gc1_25c.htm">*</a><P>

4. Everything is placed in a genus by reason of its quiddity. But the 
quiddity of God is His own mere (full) existence<A 
HREF="gc1_25d.htm">*</a>.  Now a thing is not ranked in a genus on the 
score of mere (bare) existence: otherwise 'being,' in the sense of mere 
(bare) existence, would be a genus. But that 'being' cannot be a genus 
is proved in this way. If 'being' were a genus, some differentia would 
have to be found to reduce it to species. But no differentia 
participates in its genus: I mean, genus is never comprehended in the 
idea of the differentia: because at that rate genus would be put twice 
over in the definition of the species.<A HREF="gc1_25e.htm">*</a> 
Differentia then must be something over and above what is understood 
in the idea of genus. Now nothing can be over and above what is 
understood by the idea of 'being'; since 'being' enters into the 
conceivability of all things whereof it is predicated, and thus can be 
limited by no differentia.<A HREF="gc1_25f.htm">*</a><P>

Hence it is also apparent that God cannot be defined, because every 
definition is by genus and differentias. It is apparent also that there 
can be no demonstration of God except through some effect of His 
production: because the principle of demonstration is a definition of 
the thing defined.<A HREF="gc1_25g.htm">*</a>
