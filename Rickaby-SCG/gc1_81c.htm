It is necessary that He should know other 
things as intelligible and possible, not that He should 
will other things to come to actual existence. Once
more the ideal order is necessary, but not the actual
order of creation. The one necessary actuality is God.
Though creatures are means to God's end, they are
not necessary means to any necessary end of His:
therefore their existence is not necessarily willed by
Him, albeit their possibility is necessarily discerned.
