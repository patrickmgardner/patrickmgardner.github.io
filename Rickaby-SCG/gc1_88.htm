<H1>That there is a Free Will in God</h1>

GOD does not necessarily will things outside Himself (Chap. <a 
href="gc1_81.htm">LXXXI</a>).<p>

3. <i>Will</i> is of the <i>end</i>: <i>choice</i> of the 
<i>means</i>.<a href="gc1_88a.htm">*</a> Since then God wills Himself 
as end, and other things as means, it follows that in respect of 
Himself He has will only, but in respect of other things choice. But 
choice is always an act of free will.<p> 

4. Man by free will is said to be master of his own acts. But this 
mastery belongs most of all to the Prime Agent, whose act depends on no 
other.<a href="gc1_88b.htm">*</a><p>
