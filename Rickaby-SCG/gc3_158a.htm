May one not come to forgive without positively
coming to love the offender? Yes, when the offender
was a stranger to begin with. But a friend is thoroughly 
forgiven only by being re-admitted to friendship. 
At the same time we do well to recall St Thomas's 
prefatory remark (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_9.htm">IX</a>): -- 
"For declaring truths that we believe on the revelation of
God, there are certain probable arguments ready to
hand, which may be advanced for the exercise and
consolation of believers, but not for the confutation
of opponents."
