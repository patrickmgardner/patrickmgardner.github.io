SINCE the things done by God are done in order (Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc3_77.htm"> LXXVII</a> - [<A HREF="gc3_78.htm">LXXVIII</a>] - LXXX), a 
certain order had to be followed in the manifestation of the truths of 
faith, so that some should receive those truths immediately from God, 
others receive of them, and so in order even to the last. The invisible 
good things, the vision of which makes the happiness of the blessed, 
and which are the objects of faith, are first revealed by God to the 
blessed angels by open vision: then by the ministry of angels they are 
manifested by God to certain men,<A HREF="gc3_155b.htm">*</a> not by 
open vision, but by a certitude arising from divine revelation. This 
revelation is made by an inner light of the mind, elevating the mind to 
see such things as the natural light of the understanding cannot attain 
to. As the natural light of the understanding renders a man certain of 
what he observes by that light, so does this supernatural light convey 
certainty of the objects which it reveals: for we cannot securely 
publish to others what we are not certain of ourselves. This light, 
which inwardly enlightens the mind, is sometimes borne out by other 
aids to knowledge, as well exterior as interior. There may be formed 
by divine power some utterance, or locution, heard by the external 
senses. Or it may be an inner locution, caused by God, and perceived by 
phantasy. Or there may be bodily appearances, external and visible, 
formed by God. Or such corporeal appearance may be inwardly depicted in 
phantasy. By these means, aided by the light inwardly impressed on his 
mind, man receives a knowledge of divine things. Hence, without the 
inner light, these aids are insufficient for the knowledge of divine 
things; whereas the inner light is sufficient of itself without 
them.<A HREF="gc3_155c.htm">*</a><p> 

Now because those who receive a revelation from God ought in the order 
of divine enactment to instruct others, there needed to be further 
communicated to them the grace of speech. Hence it is said: <i>The Lord 
hath given me a learned tongue</i> (Isai. L, 4): <i>I will give you 
speech and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to 
withstand and gainsay</i> (Luke xxi, 15). Hence also the gift of 
tongues (Acts ii, 4).<p> 

But because any announcement put forth requires confirmation before it 
can be received, -- unless indeed it is self-evident, and the truths of 
faith are not evident to human reason, -- there was need of something 
to confirm the announcements of the preachers of the faith. But, 
inasmuch as they transcend reason, they could not be confirmed by any 
demonstrative process of reasoning from first principles. The means 
therefore to show that the announcements of these preachers came from 
God was the evidence of works done by them such as none other than God 
could do, healing the sick, and other miracles. Hence the Lord, sending 
his disciples to preach, said: <i>Heal the sick, raise the dead, 
cleanse lepers, cast out devils</i> (Matt. x, 8); and, <i>They going 
forth preached everywhere, the Lord working withal, and confirming 
their words by the signs that followed</i>.<A HREF="gc3_155d.htm">*</a><p> 

In the aforesaid effects of grace we observe a certain difference. 
Though the name of 'grace' applies to them all, inasmuch as they are 
given 'gratuitously' without any preceding merit, nevertheless the 
working of love alone has a further claim to the name of 'grace,' as 
constituting the subject in 'the state of grace,' or in 'the good 
graces of God' (<i>gratum Deo facit</i>): for it is said: <i>I love 
them that love me</i> (Prov. viii, 17). Hence faith and hope and other 
means to the last end may be in sinners, who are not in the grace of 
God: love alone is the proper gift of the just, because <i>he who abideth 
in charity abideth in God, and God in him</i> (1 John iv, 16).<A 
HREF="gc3_155e.htm">*</a><p> 

There is another difference to be observed in these workings of grace, 
and it is this, that some of them are necessary for a whole lifetime, 
as believing, hoping, loving, and obeying the commandments of God, 
without which things salvation is impossible; and for these effects 
there must be in man certain habitual perfections, that he may be able 
to act according to them as occasion requires.<A 
HREF="gc3_155f.htm">*</a> Other effects of grace are necessary, not for 
a whole lifetime, but at certain times and places, as working of 
miracles, or foretelling of future events. To these effects habitual 
perfections are not given, but certain impressions are made by God, 
which cease when the act ceases, and have to be repeated when the act 
is repeated. Thus prophets in every revelation are illumined with a new 
light; and in every working of miracles there must be a fresh putting 
into operation of divine power.<A HREF="gc3_155g.htm">*</a>
