<H1>Arguments of those who wish to prove that the Human Soul perishes with 
the Body, with Replies to the same</h1>

<i>Arg. 1</i>. If human souls are multiplied according to the multiplication 
of bodies, as shown above (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_75.htm">LXXV</a>), then 
when the bodies perish, the souls cannot remain in their multitude.<A 
HREF="gc2_80a.htm">*</a> 
Hence one of two conclusions must follow: either the human soul must 
wholly cease to be; or there must remain one soul only, which seems to 
suit the view of those who make that alone incorruptible which is one 
in all men, whether that be the active intellect alone, as Alexander 
says, or with the active also the potential intellect, as Averroes 
says.<A HREF="gc2_80b.htm">*</a><p>

<i>Reply</i>. Whatever things are necessarily in conjunction and proportion 
with one another, are made many or one together, each by its own cause. 
If the being of the one depends on the other, its unity or 
multiplication also will depend on the same: otherwise it will depend 
on some extrinsic cause. Form then and matter must always be in 
proportion with one another, and conjoined by a certain natural tie. 
Hence matter and form must vary together in point of multiplicity and 
unity. If then the form depends on the matter for its being, the 
multiplication of the form will depend on the matter, and so will its 
unity. But if the form is in no such dependence on the matter, then, -- 
though it will still be necessary for the form to be multiplied with 
the multiplication of the matter, -- the unity or multiplicity of the 
form will not depend on the matter. But it has been shown (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_68.htm">LXVIII</a>, and <A HREF="gc2_79c.htm">note</a> [Chapter 
79], that the human soul is a form not dependent on matter for its 
being. Hence it follows that, though souls are multiplied as the bodies 
which they inform are multiplied, still the fact of bodies being many 
cannot be the cause of souls being many.<A HREF="gc2_80c.htm">*</a> And 
therefore there is no need for the plurality of souls to cease with the 
destruction of their bodies.<p>

<i>Arg. 2</i>. The formal nature (<i>ratio formalis</i> [<A 
HREF="gc2_48i.htm">Chapter 48 note i</a> ; <A 
HREF="gc2_56i.htm">Chapter 56 note i</a>]) of things is the cause of 
their differing in species. But if souls remain many after the 
perishing of their bodies, they must differ in species, since in souls 
so remaining the only diversity possible is one of formal nature. But 
souls do not change their species by the destruction of the body, 
otherwise they would be destroyed too, for all that changes from 
species to species is destroyed in the transition. Then they must have 
been different in species even before they parted from their bodies. 
But compounds take their species according to their form. So then 
individual men must differ in species, an awkward conclusion consequent 
upon the position that souls remain a multitude after their bodies are 
gone.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. It is not any and every diversity of form that makes a 
difference of species. The fact of souls separated from their bodies 
making a multitude follows from their forms being different in 
substance, inasmuch as the substance of this soul is different from the 
substance of that. But this diversity does not arise from the souls 
differing in their several essential constitutions, but from their 
being differently commensurate with different bodies: for one soul is 
commensurate with one body and not with another.<A 
HREF="gc2_80d.htm">*</a> These commensurations remain in souls even 
when their bodies perish, as the substances of the souls also remain, 
not being dependent on their bodies for their being. For it is by their 
substances that souls are forms of bodies: otherwise they would be 
united with their bodies only accidentally, and soul and body would not 
make up an essential but only an accidental unity. But inasmuch as they 
are forms, they must be commensurate with their bodies. Hence it is 
clear that their several different commensuratenesses remain in the 
departed souls, and consequently plurality.<p>

<i>Arg. 3</i>. It seems quite impossible, on the theory of those who suppose 
the eternity of the world, for human souls to remain in their multitude 
after the death of the body. For if the world is from eternity, 
infinite men have died before our time. If then the souls of the dead 
remain after death in their multitude, we must say that there is now an 
actual infinity of souls of men previously dead. But actual infinity is 
impossible in nature.<A HREF="gc2_80e.htm">*</a><p>

<i>Reply</i>. Of supporters of the eternity of the world, some have simply 
allowed the impossibility, saying that human souls perish altogether 
with their bodies. Others have said that of all souls there remains one 
spiritual existence which is common to all, -- the active intellect 
according to some,<A HREF="gc2_80f.htm">*</a> or with the active also 
the potential intellect according to others.<A HREF="gc2_80g.htm">*</a> 
Others have supposed souls to remain in their multitude after their 
bodies; but, not to be obliged to suppose an infinity of souls, they 
have said that the same souls are united to different bodies after a 
fixed period;<A HREF="gc2_80h.htm">*</a> and this was the opinion of 
the Platonists, of which hereafter (Chap. LXXXIII). Others, avoiding 
all the aforesaid answers, have maintained that there was no 
difficulty in the existence of an actual infinity of departed souls: 
for an actual infinity of things, not related to one another, was only 
an accidental infinity, in which they saw no difficulty; and this is 
the position of Avicenna and Algazel.<A HREF="gc2_80i.htm">*</a> Which 
of these was the opinion of Aristotle is not expressly set down in his 
writings, although he does expressly hold the eternity of the world. 
But the last mentioned opinion is not inconsistent with his principles: 
for in the <i>Physics</i>, III, v, his argument against an actual infinity is 
confined to natural bodies, and is not extended to immaterial 
substances. Clearly however the professors of the Catholic faith can 
feel no difficulty on this point, as they do not allow the eternity of 
the world.<A HREF="gc2_80j.htm">*</a><p>

<i>Arg. 5</i>. It is impossible for any substance to exist destitute of all 
activity.  But all activity of the soul ends with the body, as may be 
shown by simple enumeration. For the faculties of the vegetative soul 
work through bodily qualities and a bodily instrument; and the term of 
their activity is the body itself, which is perfected by the soul, is 
thereby nourished and developed, and comes to furnish the generative 
products. Also all the activities of the faculties of the sensitive 
soul are accomplished through bodily organs; and some of them are 
accompanied by (sensible) bodily change, as in the case of the 
passions. As for the act of understanding, although it is not an 
activity exercised through any bodily organ, nevertheless its objects 
are phantasms, which stand to it as colours to sight: hence as sight 
cannot see without colours, so the intellectual soul cannot understand 
without phantasms. The soul also needs, for purposes of understanding, 
the faculties which prepare the phantasms to become actual terms of 
intellect, namely, the cogitative faculty and the memory, of which it 
is certain that they cannot endure without the body, seeing that they 
work through organs of the body. Hence Aristotle says that "the soul by 
no means understands without a phantasm," and that "nothing understands 
without the passive intellect," by which name he designates the 
cogitative faculty, "which is perishable"; and that "we remember 
nothing" after death of the things that we knew in life.<A 
HREF="gc2_80k.htm">*</a> Thus then it is clear that no activity of the 
soul can continue after death, and therefore neither can its substance 
continue.<p>
 
<i>Reply</i>. The assertion that no activity can remain in the soul after its 
separation from the body, we say, is incorrect: for those activities 
remain which are not exercised through organs, and such are 
understanding and will. As for activities exercised through bodily 
organs, as are the activities of the vegetative and sentient soul, they 
do not remain. But we must observe that the soul separated from the 
body does not understand in the same way as when united with the body: 
for everything acts according as it is. Now though the being of the 
human soul, while united with the body, is perfect (<i>absolutum</i>), 
not depending on the body, still the body is a sort of housing 
(<i>stramentum</i><A HREF="gc2_80l.htm">*</a>) to it and subject 
receptive of it. Hence the proper activity of the soul, which is 
understanding, while independent of the body in this that it is not 
exercised through any bodily organ, nevertheless finds in the body its 
object, which is the phantasm.<A HREF="gc2_80m.htm">*</a> Hence, so 
long as the soul is in the body, it cannot understand without a 
phantasm,<A HREF="gc2_80n.htm">*</a> nor remember except by the 
cogitative and reminiscent faculty whereby phantasms are shaped and 
made available (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_73.htm">LXXIII</a>); and therefore 
this method of understanding and remembering has to be laid aside when 
the body is laid aside. But the being of the departed soul belongs to 
it alone without the body:<A HREF="gc2_80o.htm">*</a> hence its 
intellectual activity will not be accomplished by regard to such 
objects as phantasms existing in bodily organs, but it will understand 
by itself after the manner of those intelligences that subsist totally 
apart from bodies (Chapp. XCI-CI), from which superior beings it will 
be able to receive more abundant influence in order to more perfect 
understanding.<p> 

We may see some indication of this even in living men. When the soul is 
hampered by preoccupations about its body, it is less disposed to 
understand higher things. Hence the virtue of temperance, withdrawing 
the soul from bodily delights, helps especially to make men apt to 
understand.<A HREF="gc2_80p.htm">*</a> In sleep again, when men are not 
using their bodily senses, they have some perception of things to come, 
impressed upon them by superior beings, and attain to facts that 
transcend the measure of human reasonings.<A HREF="gc2_80q.htm">*</a> 
This is much more the case in states of syncope and ecstasy, as the 
withdrawal from the bodily senses is there greater. And that is what 
one might expect, because, as has been pointed out above (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_68.htm">LXVIII</a>), the human soul being on the boundary 
line between corporeal and incorporeal substances, and dwelling as it 
were on the horizon of eternity and time, it approaches the highest by 
receding from the lowest. Therefore, when it shall be totally severed 
from the body, it will be perfectly assimilated to the intelligences 
that subsist apart, and will receive their influence in more copious 
streams. Thus then, though the mode of our understanding according to 
the conditions of the present life is wrecked with the wreck of the 
body, it will be replaced by another and higher mode of 
understanding.<p> 

But memory, being an act exercised through a bodily organ, as Aristotle 
shows,<A HREF="gc2_80r.htm">*</a> cannot remain in the soul after the 
body is gone; unless memory be taken in another sense for the 
intellectual hold upon things known before: this intellectual memory of 
things known in life must remain in the departed soul, since the 
intellectual impressions are indelibly received in the potential 
intellect (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_74.htm">LXXIV</a>). As regards other 
activities of the soul, such as love, joy, and the like, we must beware 
of a double meaning of the terms: sometimes they mean passions, or 
emotions, which are activities of the sensitive appetite, concupiscible 
or irascible,<A HREF="gc2_80s.htm">*</a> and as such they cannot remain 
in the soul after death, as Aristotle shows:<A HREF="gc2_80t.htm">*</a> 
sometimes they mean a simple act of will without passion, as Aristotle 
says that "The joy of God is one, everlasting, and absolute," and that 
"In the contemplation of wisdom there is admirable delight"; and again 
he distinguishes the love of friendship from the love of passion.<A 
HREF="gc2_80u.htm">*</a> But as the will is a power that uses no bodily 
organ, as neither does the understanding, it is evident that such acts, 
inasmuch as they are acts of will, may remain in the departed soul.<p>
