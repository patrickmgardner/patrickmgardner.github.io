The reference is to the celebrated <i>Eth. Nic.</i> X, iv, 8: 
"Pleasure makes activity perfect, not as a habit of skill perfects the 
skilful act, but as a sort of efflorescence marking completeness, as 
bloom perfects maturity," or as we might say, like the bloom on ripe 
grapes or peaches.  So Professor Stewart (<i>Notes on Nicomachean 
Ethics</i>, ii, 418) speaks of "the law of our nature, that function is 
primary and pleasure only attendant," -- which is the real refutation 
of this objection and of hedonism in all its forms.
