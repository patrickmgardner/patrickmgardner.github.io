Every organism is a One in Many. The more perfect the organism, the 
more perfect the unity, as St Thomas says, i.e., the more perfect the 
central control. And this central control again is more perfect, the 
greater the variety and multiplicity and power of subordinates over 
which this unifying control effectually extends. In the lowest types of 
creatures, we get either multiplicity with little of unity, as in a 
heap of stones, e.g., the <i>moraine</i> on the side of a high hill; or 
unity with little of multiplicity, as in the first elements of matter, 
-- 'electrons,' or what ever else they may be. God, the Sovereign 
Unity, is likewise virtually all things (B. I, Chapp. <A

HREF="gc1_54.htm">LIV</a>).
