Still in face of such texts as, <i>The heavens are
telling the glory of God</i> (Ps. xviii): <i>Praise ye him, O sun
and moon: praise ye him, all ye stars and light</i> (Ps.
cxlviii): it is hard to deny that God might have
chosen to erect a monument to His glory in the shape
of a world of irrational creatures, and even of inanimate 
nature alone. Such creatures would have been,
in Aristotelian and Thomist phrase, 'natural slaves,'
paying their service immediately to God; and of them
the text would have been verified: <i>The Lord shall rejoice 
in his works</i> (Ps. ciii).
