St Gregory Nazianzen, in one of his poems, calls God "one and all 
things and nothing."<P> 

In the <i>Summa Theologica</i>, B. I, q. 13, art. 2, St Thomas guards 
his statement thus: "Of the names that are predicated of God absolutely 
and affirmatively, as 'good,' 'wise,' and the like, some have said that 
all such names are invented rather to remove something from God than to 
posit anything in Him. . . . . But this account is unsatisfactory. . . 
. And therefore we must say otherwise, that such names do signify the 
divine substance . . . . but fail to represent it perfectly. . . . None 
of them is a perfect expression of the substance of God, but each of 
them signifies it imperfectly, as creatures also represent it 
imperfectly."
