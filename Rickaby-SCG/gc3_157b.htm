"True, in the individual, plant or animal,
there are many potentialities frustrate and made void.
That is neither here nor there in philosophy. Philosophy 
deals not with individuals but with species;
not with Bucephalus or Alexander, but with horse,
man. Enough that one seed ever germinates, and
that all normal specimens are apt to do the like,
meeting with proper environment." -- <i>Ethics and
Natural Law</i>, p. 17.
