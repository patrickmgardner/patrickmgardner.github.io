<H1>That the Motion of the Will is caused by God, and not merely by the 
Power of the Will</h1> 

SOME, not understanding how God can cause the movement of the will in 
us without prejudice to the freedom of the will,<A 
HREF="gc3_89a.htm">*</a> have endeavoured to pervert the meaning of 
these texts, saying that God causes in us to will and to accomplish, 
inasmuch as He gives us the power of willing, but not as making us will 
this or that. Hence some have said that providence is not concerned 
with the subject-matter of free will, that is, with choices, but with 
extrinsic issues: for he who makes choice of something to gain or 
something to accomplish, for instance, building or the amassing of 
wealth, will not always be able to attain his end, and thus the issues 
of our actions are not subject to free will, but are disposed by 
providence.<A HREF="gc3_89b.htm">*</a><p> 

1. But this theory runs manifestly counter to texts of Holy Scripture. 
For it is said: <i>All our works thou hast wrought in us, O Lord</i> 
(Isai. xxvi, 12): hence we have of God not merely the power of willing, 
but also the act. And the above quoted saying of Solomon, <i>he shall 
turn it whithersoever he will</i>, shows that the divine causality 
extends at once to will-power and to actual volition.<p> 

2. Nothing can act in its own strength unless it act also in the power 
of God (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_66.htm">LXVI</a>): therefore man cannot use 
the will-power given to him except in so far as he acts in the power of 
God.<p> 

4. God is the cause of all action, and works in every agent (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_70.htm">LXX</a>): therefore He is cause of the motives of the 
will.
