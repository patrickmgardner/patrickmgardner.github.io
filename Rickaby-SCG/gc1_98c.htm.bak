This text may be not so immediately applicable
as it seems, if it be the utterance, not of God as God,
<i>ad intra</i>, but of God made Man, communicator of a
divine life to His elect, <i>ad extra</i>. See my notes on St
John i, 3, 4; xi, 25; xiv, 6.<p>
Be that application as it may, the conclusion of
this chapter, and so many similar conclusions in this
book, amount to this: that God is one self-conscious
act, the realisation of the whole ideal order, of life,
of wisdom, of power, of goodness, of necessary being, --
what Plato was groping after (Acts xvii, 27) in his
theory of Ideas, -- gathered all in one, living, conscious,
pure actuality.
