"<i>Flesh and blood</i>, that is, the body <i>sown in 
corruption<i> (v. 42), the <i>natural body</i> (v. 44), <i>image of the
earthly Adam</i> (v. 49). It is not the substance of flesh
and blood that is excluded from heaven, but their
mortal accidents, bodily needs, and passions thence
resulting. <i>Corruption</i> here means the corruptible body,
as such, with all the train of evils attendant thereupon, 
both moral evils, which go by the name of <i>the
flesh</i> in the bad sense of that term, and more particularly, 
the physical frailty and perishableness of our
mortal frame." <i>Notes on St Paul</i> in h.l.<p>
