Not because the phantasm represents sensible
phenomena is it therefore non-intellectual; but because 
in a phantasm all phenomena are clustered together 
without principle, without reference, without
assortment; no point of view being yet arrived at
from whence phenomena assume a relative importance 
to some other than an immediately present end.
This fixing upon a distant point of view is the work
of intellect.
