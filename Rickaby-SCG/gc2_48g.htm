I may have habitually in my mind the universal judgement, 
'Nuisances are to be abated.' From that, no action can arise. Annoyed 
by a noise in the street, I formulate a further judgement, more 
definite, but still universal: 'The nuisance of bawling newsboys is to 
be abated.' No action is yet possible. But when I say to myself: 'The 
nuisance of this bawling newsboy is to be abated, trouble and expense 
notwithstanding'; then and then only, upon this particular practical 
judgement, action becomes possible and will ensue. The argument shows 
that universal pronouncements of the understanding do not necessitate 
any particular action. It seems to me to show no more than that.
