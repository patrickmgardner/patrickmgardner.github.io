<h1>Of the Quality of Risen Bodies in the Lost</h1>

THE bodies of those who are to be lost must be proportionate to their 
souls. Now the souls of the wicked have a nature which is good, as 
created by God: but the will in them will be disorderly, falling short 
of its proper end. Their bodies therefore, so far as nature goes, will 
be restored to entirety: thus they will rise at a perfect age without 
any diminution of organs or limbs, and without any defect or detriment, 
which any malformation or sickness may have brought on. Hence the 
Apostle says: <i>The dead shall rise incorrupt</i> (1 Cor. xv, 52): and 
that this is to be understood of all men, good and bad alike, is clear 
from the context.<A HREF="gc4_89a.htm">*</a> But inasmuch as their soul 
will have its will turned away from God and deprived of its proper end, 
their bodies will not be <i>spiritual</i> (1 Cor. xv, 44, in the sense 
of being wholly subject to the spirit, but rather their soul will be in 
effect carnal. Nor will their bodies be <i>agile</i>, obeying the soul 
without difficulty, but rather ponderous and heavy and insupportable to 
the soul, even as their souls are by disobedience turned away from God. 
Their bodies will remain liable to suffering, even as now, or more so: 
they will suffer affliction from sensible things, but not corruption; 
as their souls will be tormented by the natural desire of happiness 
made frustrate. Their bodies too will be opaque and darksome, as their 
souls will be void of the light of divine knowledge. This is the 
meaning of what the Apostle says, that <i>we shall all rise again, but 
we shall not all be changed</i> (1 Cor. xv, 51): for the good alone 
shall be changed to glory, and the bodies of the wicked shall rise 
without glory.<A HREF="gc4_89b.htm">*</a><p> 

Some may think it impossible for the bodies of the wicked to be liable 
to suffering, and yet not liable to disintegration, since every 
impression suffered, when it goes beyond the common, takes off from the 
substance: so we see that if a body is long kept in the fire, it will 
be entirely consumed; and when pain becomes unusually intense, the 
soul is separated from the body. But all this happens on the 
supposition of the transmutability of matter from form to form. Now the 
human body, after the resurrection, will not be transmutable from form 
to form, either in the good or in the wicked; because in both it will 
be entirely perfected by the soul in respect of its natural being.<A
