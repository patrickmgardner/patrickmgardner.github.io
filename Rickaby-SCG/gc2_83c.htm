Evolutionists say just the contrary, one great difference between them 
and the scholastics. The position is saved by the consideration that any 
evolution must be the ordinance of an all-perfect Mind.<p> 

The Platonists and Origenists, St Thomas's opponents in this now effete 
controversy about the pre-existence of souls, would not have allowed 
that the soul was the form of the body, or was imperect without the 
body, or better for union with it. Rather they held that for spirit to 
be united with flesh was to the spirit encumbrance and punishment. Even 
Catholics, who confess the soul to be the form of the body, may still 
linger over Plato's words: "Union between soul and body is nowise better 
than separation" (<i>Laws</i>, VIII, 821), such union, that is, as 
obtains in this mortal life (I Cor. xv, 42-50). We do not suppose 
pre-existence of souls, a theory which, as St Thomas justly argues, 
would make humanity begin in the degradation of its nobler component: 
but we may suppose death to be naturally a deliverance, an elevation 
rather than an impairing of the disembodied spirit. Such a conception 
of course affects the value of any <i>a priori</i> natural arguement 
for resurrection (B. IV, Chap LXXIX).
