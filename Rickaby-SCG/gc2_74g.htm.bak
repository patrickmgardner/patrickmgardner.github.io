"Memory is incidentally of what is understood, but ordinarily of what 
is primarily perceived by sense. Wherefore it is found in sundry other 
animals besides men: -- whereas, if it were one of the intellectual 
parts, not many animals would have any memory, perhaps even no mortal 
would have any" (Aristotle, <i>De memoria</i>, I, i, 7).
