<H1>That we cannot in this life see God as He essentially is<A 
HREF="gc3_47a.htm">*</a></h1>

If the connatural dependence of our understanding on phantasms prevents 
us in this life from understanding other pure spirits, much less can we 
in this life see the divine essence, which transcends all angels. Of 
this fact the following may also be taken as an indication: the higher 
our mind is raised to the contemplation of spiritual things, the more 
it is abstracted from sensible things: but the final terminus to which 
contemplation can possibly arrive is the divine substance: therefore 
the mind that sees the divine substance must be totally divorced from 
bodily senses, either by death or by some rapture. Hence it is said in 
the person of God: <i>No man shall see me and live</i> (Exod. xxxiii, 
20). Whereas in Holy Scripture some are said to have seen God, that 
must be understood to have been inasmuch as by some vision of the 
phantasy or corporeal appearance the presence of divine power was 
shown.<p> 

Certain words of Augustine raise a difficulty in this matter. Thus he 
says (<i>De Trinitate</i>, IX, vii) : "In the eternal truth, whence all 
corporeal creatures are, we see with our mind's eye the form according 
to which we are, and according to which we execute anything truly and 
rightly either in ourselves or in corporeal things." Also he says 
(<i>Confess.</i> I, xxv) : "If both of us see that what you say is 
true, and we both see that what I say is true, where, I pray, do we see 
it? Neither I in you, nor you in me, but both of us in that 
unchangeable truth which is above our minds." And to the like effect 
(<i>De Trin.</i> XII, ii) : " It belongs to the higher reason to judge 
of these bodily things according to aspects (<i>rationes</i>) eternal 
and everlasting, which certainly would not be unchangeable, were they 
not above the human mind." But aspects unchangeable and everlasting 
cannot be elsewhere than in God, since, according to Catholic faith,<A 
HREF="gc3_47b.htm">*</a> God alone is eternal. It seems to follow that 
we can see God in this life, and that by seeing Him, and aspects of 
things in Him, we judge of the rest of things.<A HREF="gc3_47c.htm">*</a> 

On the other hand it is incredible that in the above words Augustine 
should mean to assert that in this life we can understand God as He 
essentially is, seeing that in his book <i>De videndo Deum</i> he says 
the contrary.<A HREF="gc3_47d.htm">*</a>  It remains to enquire how in 
this life we can see that unchangeable truth or those everlasting 
aspects. That truth is in the soul, Augustine himself confesses:<A 
HREF="gc3_47e.htm">*</a> hence he proves the immortality of the soul 
from the eternity of truth. But truth is not in the soul alone as God 
is said to be 'essentially' (<i>per essentiam</i>) in all things; nor 
as He is by His likeness in all things, inasmuch as everything is 
called 'true' so far as it approaches to the likeness of God: for from 
those points of view the soul stands in no better position than other 
beings: truth then is in the soul in a special manner, inasmuch as the 
soul knows truth. As then the soul and other beings are called 'true' 
in their natures, as bearing some likeness to the supreme nature of 
God, -- which is truth itself, as being its own fulness of actual 
understanding (<i>suum intellectum esse</i>),<A 
HREF="gc3_47f.htm">*</a> -- so what is known by the soul is manifestly 
known, inasmuch as there exists in the soul a likeness of that divine 
truth which God knows. Hence on the text (Ps. xi, 2) <i>truths are 
diminished from the sons of men</i>, the Gloss [Augustine, 
<i>Enarrationes</i> in h.l.] says: "The truth is one, whereby holy 
souls are illumined: but since there are many souls, there may be said 
to be in them many truths, as from one face many images appear in as 
many mirrors." Though different things are known and believed to be 
true by different minds, yet there are some truths in which all men 
agree, for instance, the primary intuitions of intellect as well 
speculative as practical, because, so far as these go, an image of 
divine truth comes out universally in the minds of all. As then 
whatever any mind knows for certain, it knows it by virtue of these 
intuitions, which are the canons of all judgements, and into which all 
judgements may be resolved, the mind is said to see all things in the 
divine truth, or in everlasting aspects, and to judge of all things 
according to those aspects. This explanation is confirmed by the words 
of Augustine (<i>Soliloq.</i> I, viii, 15): "Even the truths taught in 
the schools, which every one, who understands them, unhesitatingly 
allows to be true, we must believe, could not possibly be understood, 
were they not lit up by the light of another, what I may call a sun 
proper to them (<i>nisi ab alio quasi sole suo illustrantur</i>)." He 
says then that the theories of science are seen in the divine truth as 
visible objects are seen in the light of the sun: but certainly such 
objects are not seen in the very body of the sun, but by the light 
which is a likeness of the solar brightness, remaining in the air and 
similar bodies. From these words then of Augustine it cannot be 
gathered that God is seen in His substance in this life, but only as in 
a mirror, which the Apostle also confesses of the knowledge of this 
life, saying (1 Cor. xiii, 12): <i>We see now as in a glass darkly</i>.<p> 

Though the human mind represents the likeness of God more closely than 
lower creatures, still such knowledge of God as can be gathered from 
the human mind does not transcend that kind of knowledge which is 
borrowed from sensible objects, since the soul knows her own essential 
nature by understanding the nature of things of sense (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_46.htm">XLVI</a>).<A HREF="gc3_47g.htm">*</a> Hence neither 
by this method can God be known in any higher way than as the cause is 
known by the effect.<A HREF="gc3_47h.htm">*</a><p>
