<H1>Of the Effects attributed to the Holy Ghost in Scripture in the way of 
Gifts bestowed on the Rational Creature</h1>

SINCE the Father, Son and Holy Ghost have the same power, as they have 
the same essence, everything that God works in us must be by the 
efficient causation of Father, Son and Holy Ghost together. But the 
word of wisdom, sent us by God, whereby we know God, is properly 
representative of the  Son; and the  love, wherewith we love God, is 
properly representative of the Holy Ghost. Thus the charity that is in 
us, though it is the effect of Father, Son and Holy Ghost, is in a 
certain special aspect said to be in us through the Holy Ghost. But 
since divine effects not only begin by divine operation, but are also 
sustained in being by the same, and nothing operates where it is not<A 
HREF="gc4_21a.htm">*</a>, it needs must follow that wherever there is 
any effect wrought by God, there is God Himself who works it.<A 
HREF="gc4_21b.htm">*</a> Hence, since the charity wherewith we love God 
is in us through the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost Himself must be in us, 
so long as charity is in us. <i>Know ye not that ye are the temple of 
God, and the Holy Ghost dwelleth in you?</i> (1 Cor. iii, 16.) And 
through the Holy Ghost the Father and Son also dwell in us. Hence the 
Lord says: <i>We will come to him, and take up our abode with him</i> 
(John xiv, 23). Cf. 1 John iv, 13, 16.<p> 

It is a point of friendship to reveal one's secrets to one's friend: 
for as friendship unites affections, and makes of two as it were one 
heart, a man may well seem not to have uttered beyond his own heart 
what he has revealed to his friend. Hence the Lord says to His 
disciples: <i>I will not call you servants, but friends, because all 
things that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you</i> 
(John xv, 15). Since then by the Holy Ghost we are constituted friends 
of God, the revelation of divine mysteries to men is fittingly said to 
take place through the Holy Ghost: <i>To us God has revealed them 
through the Holy Ghost</i> (1 Cor. ii, 10). Besides the revealing of 
one's secrets to one's friend, which is part of the union of affections 
that goes with friendship, there is a further requisite of the same 
union, to share one's possessions with one's friend, according to 1 
John iii, 17. And therefore all the gifts of God are said to be given 
us by the Holy Ghost (1 Cor. xii, 7-11). And by such gifts of the 
Spirit we are conformed to God, and by Him rendered apt to the 
performance of good works, and our way is thereby paved to happiness: 
which three effects the Apostle declares: <i>God hath anointed us, and 
sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts</i> (2 Cor. 
i, 21, 22: cf. Eph. i, 13, 14). The <i>sealing</i> may be taken to 
imply the likeness of conformity to God: the <i>annointing</i>, the 
fitting of man to do perfect acts: the <i>pledge</i>, the hope whereby 
we are set on the way to the heavenly inheritance of life 
everlasting.<p> 

And because good will towards a person leads at times to the adoption 
of him as a son, that so the inheritance may belong to him, the 
adoption of the sons of God is properly attributed to the Holy Ghost: 
<i>Ye have received the spirit of adoption of sons, wherein we cry, 
Abba, Father</i> (Rom. viii, 15).<p> 

Again, by admission to friendship all offence is removed. Since then we 
are rendered sons of God through the Holy Ghost, through Him also our 
sins are forgiven us by God; and therefore the Lord says: <i>Receive ye 
the Holy Ghost: whose sins ye shall forgive, they are forgiven them</i> 
(John xx, 22). And therefore forgiveness is denied to them who 
blaspheme against the Holy Ghost (Matt. xii, 31), as to persons who 
have not that whereby man attains the forgiveness of his sins.<A
