<H1>That the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son<A 
HREF="gc4_24a.htm">*</a></h1>

<i>IF any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is not of him</i> (Rom. 
viii, 9). These words of the Apostle show that the same Spirit is of 
the Father and of the Son: for the text alleged follows upon these 
words immediately preceding: <i>If so be that the Spirit of God dwell 
in you</i>. Now it cannot be said that the Holy Ghost is the Spirit 
merely of the man Christ (Luke iv, 3): for from Gal. iv, 6, <i>Since ye 
are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts</i>, it 
appears that the Holy Ghost makes sons of God inasmuch as He is the 
Spirit of the Son of God, -- sons of God, that is to say, by adoption, 
which means assimilation to Him who is Son of God by nature. For so the 
text has it: <i>He hath predestined</i> (them) <i>to become conformable to the 
image of his Son, that he may be the first-born among many brethren</i> 
(Rom. viii, 29). But the Holy Ghost cannot be called the Spirit of the 
Son of God except as taking His origin from Him: for this distinction 
of origin is the only one admissible in the Godhead.<p> 

2. The Holy Ghost is sent by the Son: <i>When the Paraclete cometh, 
whom I will send you from the Father</i> (John xv, 26). Now the sender 
has some authority (<i>auctoritatem</i>) over the sent. We must say 
then that the Son has some authority in respect of the Holy Ghost. Now 
that cannot be an authority of dominion, superiority, or seniority: it 
can only be an authority in point of origin. So then the Holy Ghost is 
from the Son. But if any one will have it that the Son also is sent by 
the Holy Ghost, according to the text (Luke iv, 18) where the Lord said 
that the saying of Isaias (lxi, 1) was fulfilled in Him: <i>The Spirit 
of the Lord is upon me: to preach glad tidings to the poor he hath sent 
me:</i> we must observe that it is in respect of the nature which He 
has assumed that the Son is said to be sent by the Holy Ghost [cf. Acts 
x, 38]: but the Holy Ghost has assumed no such nature, that the Son in 
point thereof should send Him or have authority regarding Him.<p> 

3. The Son says of the Holy Ghost: <i>He shall glorify me, because he 
shall receive of mine</i> (John xvi, 14). Now it cannot be maintained 
that He shall receive that which belongs to the Son, namely, the divine 
essence, but not receive it of the Son, but only of the Father: for it 
follows, <i>All things whatsoever that the Father hath are mine: 
therefore did I say to you that he shall receive of mine:</i> for if 
all things that the Father has belong to the Son, the authority of the 
Father, whereby He is the principle of the Holy Ghost, must belong 
likewise to the Son.<p> 

7. The Son is from the Father, and so too is the Holy Ghost. The Father 
then must be related to the Son and to the Holy Ghost as a principle to 
that which is of the principle. Now He is related to the Son in the way 
of paternity, but not so to the Holy Ghost, otherwise the Holy Ghost 
would be the Son. There must then be in the Father another relation, 
which relates Him to the Holy Ghost; and that relation is called 
'spiration.' In like manner, as there is in the Son a relation which 
relates Him to the Father, and is called 'filiation,' there must be in 
the Holy Ghost too a relation which relates Him to the Father, and is 
called 'procession.' And thus in point of the origin of the Son from 
the Father there are two relations, one in the originator, the other in 
the originated, namely, paternity and filiation; and other two in point 
of the origin of the Holy Ghost, namely spiration and procession. Now 
paternity and spiration do not constitute two persons, but belong to 
the one person of the Father, because they are not opposed one to the 
other. Neither then would filiation and procession constitute two 
persons, but would belong to one person, but for the fact of their 
being opposed one to the other. But it is impossible to assign any 
other opposition than that which is in point of origin. There must then 
be an opposition in point of origin between the Son and the Holy Ghost, 
so that one is from the other.<p> 

10. If the rejoinder is made that the processions of Son and Holy Ghost 
differ in principle, inasmuch as the Father produces the Son by mode of 
understanding, as the Word, and produces the Holy Ghost by mode of 
will, as Love, the opponent must go on to say that according to the 
difference of understanding and will in God the Father there are two 
distinct processions and two distinct beings so proceeding. But will 
and understanding in God the Father are not distinguished with a real 
but only with a mental distinction (B. I, Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc1_45.htm">XLV</a>, <A HREF="gc1_73.htm">LXXIII</a>). 
Consequently the two processions and the two beings so proceeding must 
differ only by a mental distinction. But things that differ only by a 
mental distinction are predicable of one another: thus it is true to 
say that God's will is His understanding, and His understanding is His 
will. It will be true then to say that the Holy Ghost is the Son, and 
the Son the Holy Ghost, which is the impious position of Sabellius. 
Therefore, to maintain the distinction between Holy Ghost and Son, it 
is not enough to say that the Son proceeds by mode of understanding  
and the Holy Ghost by mode of will, unless we further go on to say that 
the Holy Ghost is of the Son.<p> 

13. The Father and the Son, being one in essence, differ only in this, 
that He is the Father, and He the Son. Everything else is common to 
Father and Son. But being the origin of the Holy Ghost lies outside 
of the relationship of paternity and filiation: for the relation 
whereby the Father is Father differs from the relation whereby the 
Father is the origin of the Holy Ghost. Being the origin then of the 
Holy Ghost is something common to Father and Son.
