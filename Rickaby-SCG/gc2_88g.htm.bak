According to Aristotle, <i>De gen. animal.</i>, and therefore according 
to St Thomas, no bodily matter of the male <i>semen</i> ever becomes a 
constituent of the body of the embryo: that is entirely taken from the 
mother. What the male <i>semen</i> furnishes is a certain motive 
power, <b>dunamis kai kin&ecirc;sis</b>, which causes conception and 
carries the embryo through the stages of its development. This is the 
'formative power' here spoken of. Offspring is said to be of father 
and mother, "as a couch is of a carpenter and timber" (<i>De gen. 
animal.</i>, I, xxi), the male <i>semen</i> being as the tool, which, 
wielded by the carpenter, makes the couch, but is not the material of 
which the couch is made. So (I, xxii): "The male <i>semen</i> is no 
part of the embryo: . . . . but nature uses it as an instrument and 
actually efficient cause, as is the efficiency of tools in products of 
art." Pursuant to this doctrine, Aristotle expresses himself in a way 
not unfavourable to traducianism in regard of the sentient soul: -- 
"The body is from the female, but the soul is from the male, for the 
soul gives formal being to a certain body"; <b>esti de to men 
s&ocirc;ma ek tou th&ecirc;leos, h&ecirc; de psuch&ecirc; ektou 
arrenos; h&ecirc; gar psuch&ecirc; ousia s&ocirc;matos tinos esti</b> 
(II, iv): which is explained (II, v), "the female supplies the 
material, but the male the principle of motion": <b>hul&ecirc;n men oun 
parechei to th&ecirc;lu, t&ecirc;n de arch&ecirc;n t&ecirc;s 
kin&ecirc;se&ocirc;s ho arr&ecirc;n</b>. In the same <i>De gen. 
animal.</i>, II, v, Aristotle goes on to say that the soul which the 
male parent imparts is not the vegetative soul, -- for that is already 
in the material supplied by the female, -- but the sentient soul: 
<b>empoiei gar touto (to arren) t&ecirc;n aisth&ecirc;tik&ecirc;n 
psuch&ecirc;n h&ecirc; di hautou &ecirc; dia t&ecirc;s gon&ecirc;s</b>. 
A sentient soul, he adds, is necessary from the first, for the 
formation of what is to be not a mere vegetative but a sentient body.
