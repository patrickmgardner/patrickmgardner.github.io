<H1>Arguments wherewith some try to show that the World is not 
Eternal, and Solutions of the same</h1> 

<i>Arg. 1.</i> God is the cause of all things (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_15.htm">XV</a>).  But a cause must be prior in duration to 
the effects of its action.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i> That is true of things that act by motion, for the effect 
is not till the termination of the motion: but with causes that act 
instantaneously there is no such necessity.<p>

<i>Arg. 2.</i> Since the whole of being is created by God, it cannot be 
said to be made out of any being: whence the conclusion follows that it 
is made out of nothing, and consequently that it has existence after 
not existing.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> To the notion of <i>being made out of something</i>, if 
that is not admitted one must supply the contradictory notion: which 
contradictory notion is <i>not being made out of anything</i>. Observe, 
it is not <i>being made out of nothing</i>, except in the former sense 
of <i>not being made out of anything</i>.<A HREF="gc2_38a.htm">*</a><p>

<i>Arg. 3.</i> It is not possible to pass through infinity. But if the 
world always had been, infinity would have been passed through by this 
time, there being infinite days, or daily rounds of the sun, if the 
world always has been.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> An infinite quantity, though not existing in simultaneous 
actual realisation, may nevertheless be in succession, because every 
infinite, so taken, is really finite. Any given round of the sun could 
be passed, because so far the number of them was finite: but when they 
are all viewed together, on the supposition that the world had always 
existed, it would be impossible to fix upon any first day, and so to 
make any transition from that to the present day, since transition 
always requires two extreme points.<p>

Arg 4. It would follow that addition is made to the infinite, because 
to past days, or sun-rounds, a new round is daily added.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> There is nothing to hinder addition to the infinite on 
that side on which it is finite. Supposing time eternal, it must be 
infinite as preceding, but finite as succeeding, for the present is the 
limit of the past.<p>

<i>Arg. 5.</i> It would follow in a world always existing that we 
should have an infinite series of efficient causes, father being cause 
of child, and grandfather to father, and so to infinity.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> The impossibility of an infinite series of efficient 
causes, according to philosophers (Aristotle, <i>Metaph.</i> ii, 2), 
holds for causes acting together: because then the effect has to depend 
on an infinity of co-existent actions; and the infinity of causes there 
is essential, the whole infinite multitude of them being requisite for 
the production of the effect. But in the case of causes not acting 
together no such impossibility holds, in the opinion of those who 
suppose an endless series of generations. The infinity in this case is 
accidental to the causes: for to Socrates's father, as such, it is 
quite an accident whether he be the son of another man or no: whereas 
to a stick, inasmuch as it moves a stone, it is not an accident whether 
it be moved by an hand: for it only moves inasmuch as it is moved.<p>

<i>Arg. 6.</i> It would follow that an infinite multitude exists, to 
wit, the immortal souls of infinite men who have been in the past.<p>

<i>Reply.</i> This objection is more difficult: nevertheless the 
argument is not of much use, because it supposes many things.<A 
HREF="gc2_38b.htm">*</a>  Since these reasons, alleged by some to 
prove that the world has not always existed, are not necessarily 
conclusive, though they have a certain probability, it is sufficient to 
touch on them slightly, without insisting too much, that the Catholic 
faith may not seem to rest on empty reasonings, and not rather on the 
solid basis of the teaching of God.<p>
