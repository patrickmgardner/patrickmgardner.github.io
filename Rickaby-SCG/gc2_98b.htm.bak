A separately subsisting intelligence, or angel, is an <b>empsuchon 
eidos</b>, or living idea, more or less in the Platonic sense. Now an 
idea is nothing, if it be not a term of intellect. The human mind then 
comes to know itself by getting an idea of something else: the angel 
knows himself always and essentially, because he is an idea.
