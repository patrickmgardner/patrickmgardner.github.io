Contrary to one of the paradoxes of the Stoics,
refuted also in <i>Sum. Theol.</i>, 1a-2ae, q. 73, art. 2
(<i>Aquinas Ethicus</i>, I, 211, 212). The text, James ii, 10,
may refer to the breaking of even one commandment
contumaciously and contemptuously. Now there is a
certain contumaciousness in every mortal sin; and one
such sin is enough to destroy sanctity and supernatural 
righteousness; cf. Ezechiel xxviii, 12, 13.
