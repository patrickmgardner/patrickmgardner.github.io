<H1>That God knows things which are not<A HREF="gc1_66a.htm">*</a></h1>

THE knowledge of the divine mind stands to things as the knowledge of 
the artificer to the products of his art. But the artificer by the 
knowledge of his art knows even those products of it which are not yet 
produced.<P> 

3. God knows other things besides Himself by His essence, inasmuch as 
His essence is the type of other things that come forth from Him (Chap. 
<A HREF="gc1_54.htm">LIV</a>). But since the essence of God is 
infinitely perfect (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_43.htm">XLIII</a>), while of 
every other thing the being and perfection is limited, it is impossible 
for the whole sum of other things to equal the perfection of the divine 
essence. Therefore the representative power of that essence extends to 
many more things than the things that are. As then God knows entirely 
the power and perfection of His essence, His knowledge reaches not only 
to things that are, but also to things that are not.<P> 

6. The understanding of God has no succession, as neither has His 
being: it is all together, ever abiding, which is the essential notion 
of eternity, whereas the duration of time extends by succession of 
before and after. The proportion of eternity to the whole duration of 
time is as the proportion of an indivisible point to a continuous 
surface, -- not of that indivisible point which is a term of the 
surface, and is not in every part of its continuous extent: for to such 
a point an instant of time bears resemblance; but of that indivisible 
point which lies outside of the surface, and yet co-exists with every 
part or point of its continuous extent:<A HREF="gc1_66b.htm">*</a> for 
since time does not run beyond motion, eternity, which is altogether 
beyond motion, is no function of time. Again, since the being of the 
eternal never fails, eternity is present to every time or instant of 
time.  Some sort of example of this may be seen in a circle: for a 
point taken on the circumference does not coincide with every other 
point; but the centre, lying away from the circumference, is directly 
opposite to every point on the circumference.<A 
HREF="gc1_66c.htm">*</a> Whatever therefore is in any portion of time, 
co-exists with the eternal, as present to it, although in respect to 
another portion of time it be past or future. But nothing can co-exist 
in presence with the eternal otherwise than with the whole of it, 
because it has no successive duration. Whatever therefore is done in 
the whole course of time, the divine mind beholds it as present 
throughout the whole of its eternity; and yet it cannot be said that 
what is done in a definite portion of time has always been an existing 
fact.  The conclusion is that God has knowledge of things that in the 
course of time as yet are not.<P> 

By these reasons it appears that God has knowledge of nonentities. But 
all nonentities do not stand in the same regard to His knowledge.  
Things that neither are, nor shall be, nor have been, are known by God 
as possible to His power: hence He does not know them as being anywise 
in themselves, but only as being within the compass of divine power. 
These sort of things are said by some to be known by God with the 
'knowledge of simple understanding' (<i>notitia simplicis 
intelligentiae</i>). But as for those things that are present, past, or 
future to us, God knows them as they are within the compass of His 
power; and as they are within the compass of their own several created 
causes; and as they are in themselves; and the knowledge of such things 
is called the 'knowledge of vision' (<i>notitia visionis</i>). For of 
the things that are not yet with us,<A HREF="gc1_66d.htm">*</a> God 
sees not only the being that they have in their causes, but also the 
being that they have in themselves, inasmuch as His eternity is 
indivisibly present to all time. We must remember that God knows the 
being of everything through His own essence: for His essence is 
representable by many things that are not, nor ever shall be, nor ever 
have been. That same essence is the type of the power of every cause, 
in virtue of which power effects pre-exist in their causes. Again the 
being of everything, that it has in itself, is modelled upon the being 
of the divine essence. Thus then God knows nonentities inasmuch as in 
some way they have being, either in the power of God, or in their 
(creature) causes, or in themselves.<A HREF="gc1_66e.htm">*</a> To this 
the authority of Holy Scripture also gives testimony: <i>All things are 
known to the Lord our God before their creation; as also, after they 
are fully made, he regardeth all</i> (Ecclus XXIII, 29): and, <i>Before I 
formed thee in the womb, I knew thee</i> (Jer. I, 5).
