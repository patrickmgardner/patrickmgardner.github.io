<H1>That God is to all things the Cause of their being</h1> 

Having shown (Chap <A HREF="gc2_6.htm">VI</a>) that God is to some 
things the cause of their being, we must further show that nothing out 
of God has being except of Him. Every attribute that attaches to 
anything otherwise than as constituting its essence, attaches to it 
through some cause, as whiteness to man.<A HREF="gc2_15a.htm">*</a> To 
be in a thing independently of causation is to be there primarily and 
immediately, as something ordinary (<i>per se</i>) and essential. It is 
impossible for any one attribute, attaching to two things, to attach to 
each as constituting its essence. What is predicated as constituent of 
a thing's essence, has no extension beyond that thing: as the having 
three angles together equal to two right angles has no extension beyond 
'triangle,' of which it is predicated, but is convertible with 
'triangle.' Whatever then attaches to two things, cannot attach to them 
both as constituting the essence of each. It is impossible therefore for 
any one attribute to be predicated of two subjects without its being 
predicated of one or the other as something come there by the operation 
of some cause: either one must be the cause of the other, or some third 
thing must be cause of both. Now 'being' is predicated of everything 
that is. It is impossible therefore for there to be two things, each 
having being independently of any cause; but either these things must 
both of them have being by the operation of a cause, or one must be to 
the other the cause of its being. Therefore everything which in any way 
is, must have being from that which is uncaused; that is, from God (B. 
I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_15.htm">XV</a>).<p> 

2. What belongs to a thing by its nature, and is not dependent on any 
causation from without, cannot suffer diminution or defect. For if 
anything essential is withdrawn from or added to nature, that nature, 
so increased or diminished, will give place to another. If on the other 
hand the nature is left entire, and something else is found to have 
suffered diminution, it is clear that what has been so diminished does 
not absolutely depend on that nature, but on some other cause, by 
removal of which it is diminished. Whatever property therefore attaches 
to a thing less in one instance than in others, does not attach to that 
thing in mere virtue of its nature, but from the concurrence of some 
other cause. The cause of all effects in a particular kind will be that 
whereof the kind is predicated to the utmost. Thus we see that the 
hottest body is the cause of heat in all hot bodies, and the brightest 
body the cause of brightness in all bright bodies. But God is in the 
highest degree 'being' (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_13.htm">XIII</a>). He 
then is the cause of all things whereof 'being' is predicated.<A 
HREF="gc2_15b.htm">*</a><p> 

3. The order of causes must answer to the order of effects, since 
effects are proportionate to their causes. Hence, as special effects 
are traced to special causes, so any common feature of those special 
effects must be traced to some common cause. Thus, over and above the 
particular causes of this or that generation, the sun is the universal 
cause of all generation; and the king is the universal cause of 
government in his kingdom, over the officials of the kingdom, and also 
over the officials of individual cities. But being is common to all 
things. There must then be over all causes some Cause to whom it 
belongs to give being.<p> 

4. What is by essence, is the cause of all that is by participation, as 
fire is the cause of all things fiery, as such. But God is being by His 
essence because He is pure being; while every other being is being by 
participation, because there can only be one being that is its own 
existence (B. I, Chapp. <A HREF="gc1_22.htm">XXII</a>, <A 
HREF="gc1_42.htm">XLII</a>). God therefore is cause of being to all 
other beings.<p> 

5. Everything that is possible to be and not to be, has some cause: 
because, looked at by itself, it is indifferent either way; and thus 
there must be something else that determines it one way. Hence, as a 
process to infinity is impossible, there must be some necessary being 
that is cause of all things which are possible to be and not to be.<A 
HREF="gc2_15c.htm">*</a><p> 

6. God in His actuality and perfection includes the perfections of all 
things (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>); and thus He is 
virtually all. He is therefore the apt producing cause of all.<p> 

This conclusion is confirmed by divine authority: for it is said: 
<i>Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are 
therein</i> (Ps. cxlv, 6). And, <i>All things were made by him, and 
without him was made nothing</i> (John ~, 3). And <i>From whom are all 
things, by whom are all things, in (unto) whom are all things</i> (Rom. 
xi, 16).<p>
