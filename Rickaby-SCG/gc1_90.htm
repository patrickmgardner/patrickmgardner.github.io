<H1>That there is in God Delight and Joy</h1>

THERE are some passions which, though they do not befit God as 
passions, nevertheless, so far as their specific nature is considered, 
do not involve anything inconsistent with divine perfection.  Of the 
number of these is Delight and Joy. Joy is of present good.  Neither by 
reason of its object, which is good, nor by reason of the relation in 
which the object, good actually possessed, stands to the subject, does 
joy specifically contain anything inconsistent with divine perfection. 
Hence it is manifest that joy or Delight has being properly in God. For 
as good and evil apprehended is the object of the sensitive appetite, 
so also is it of the intellectual appetite, or will. It is the ordinary 
function of both appetites to pursue good and to shun evil, either real 
or apparent, except that the object of the intellectual appetite is 
wider than that of the sensitive, inasmuch as the intellectual appetite 
regards good and evil simply, while the sensitive appetite regards good 
and evil felt by sense; as also the object of intellect is wider than 
the object of sense. But the activities of appetite are specified by 
their objects.  There exist therefore in the intellectual appetite, or 
will, activities specifically similar to the activities of the 
sensitive appetite, and differing only in this, that in the sensitive 
appetite they are passions on account of the implication of a bodily 
organ, but in the intellectual appetite they are simple activities.<A 
HREF="gc1_90a.htm">*</a>  For as by the passion of fear, coming over 
the sensitive appetite, one shuns evil looming in the future, so the 
intellectual appetite works to the same effect without passion.<A 
HREF="gc1_90b.htm">*</a> Since then joy and Delight are not repugnant 
to God specifically, but only inasmuch as they are passions, it follows 
that they are not wanting even in the divine will.<p> 

2. Joy and Delight are a sort of rest of the will in its object.  But 
God singularly rests in Himself as in the first object of His own will, 
inasmuch as He has all sufficiency in Himself.<p> 

3. Delight is the perfection of activity, perfecting activity as bloom 
does youth.<A HREF="gc1_90c.htm">*</a> But the activity of the divine 
understanding is most perfect. If therefore our act of understanding, 
coming to its perfection, yields delight, most delightful must be the 
act whereby God understands.<p>

4. Everything naturally feels joy over what is like itself, except 
accidentally, inasmuch as the likeness hinders one's own gain, and 'two 
of a trade' quarrel.  But every good thing is some likeness of the 
divine goodness, and nothing is lost to God by the good of His 
creature. Therefore God rejoices in good everywhere.<p>

Joy and Delight differ in our consideration: for Delight arises out of 
good really conjoined with the subject; while Joy does not require this 
real conjunction, but the mere resting of the will on an agreeable 
object is sufficient for it.<A HREF="gc1_90d.htm">*</a>  Hence, 
strictly speaking, Delight is at good conjoined with the subject: Joy 
over good external to the subject. Thus, in strict parlance, God takes 
delight in Himself: but has Joy both over Himself and over other 
things.
