It is not 'evil in itself,' that is, not absolutely,
universally, and under all circumstances. Neither is
it universally and under all circumstances good; but
where there is a good, of nature established, there is
somehow, and under some conditions, a natural and
good way of attaining to that good; and where there
is for all men but one way of attaining that good,
the said way cannot be evil for ever and for all.<p>
