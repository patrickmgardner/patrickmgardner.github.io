<i>This</i> or <i>that</i> actual motion of <i>this</i> individual
will, not being determinately contained in its cause,
since "will-force" is not "determined to any fixed
mode of action," how can God, by any knowledge of
causes, gain cognisance of this particular motion of
free-will as actually taking place? By "a causal 
influence over the motions of the will," says St Thomas.
The discussion of this obscure "causal influence"
made the strife of Thomist and Molinist in the 
seventeenth century.
