This argument will sound superfluous to most
modern ears, content as men now are to register and
argue phenomena, without regard to essences and
substances, or altogether disbelieving in such 'things
in themselves.' We have thousands of practical 
electricians; but who knows the essence of electricity?
Even if molecular science shall ever conduct us to an
accepted theory of the ultimate constituents of 
matter, we can scarcely hope thence to deduce the 
phenomena even of a pebble or one grain of sand. They
are likely to prove complex beyond human 
calculation.  The only essences that we know, and can use
as a basis of deduction, are those which answer to
certain abstract conceptions, as 'triangle,'  
'fortitude,' 'sovereignty.' Starting with implicit 
confidence in the <i>dicta</i> of Aristotle, and lightly landing in
conclusions by a priori methods, mediaeval 
philosophers generally had no idea of the vast complexity of
nature and of their own ignorance of physics. We
know more physics than they did, and we know our
own ignorance better. We stand stupefied and 
bewildered before the intricacy and vastness of nature.
And if nature is so far unknowable to us, how must
God transcend our knowledge? This St Thomas 
recognises (B. IV, Chap. 1).  Not the mystery and 
unknowableness of God needs to be brought home to
the modern mind, but the fact that anything can be
known with certainty about God at all.
