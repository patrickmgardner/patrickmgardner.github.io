It is said, I think, by Aristotle, that only natural objects fall 
into genera and species, not artificial beings. It is no concern of St 
Thomas here to deny that artificial things may anyhow be classified, 
though it be not by generic and specific differences. To classify is to 
limit. God is above all classification.
