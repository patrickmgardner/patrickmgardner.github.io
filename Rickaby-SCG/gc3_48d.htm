<i>Perfectam speculationem scientiarum</i>, in the thirteenth century! 
In the last age of human progress will the wisest have arrived at 
anything like a 'perfect view of scientific truth?' There are many 
perturbing forces to interfere with the steady progress as well of the 
race as of the individual: -- infidelity, which will not be <i>taught 
of God</i>, and so wastes its powers after the fashion of an 
untractable schoolboy: sloth and timidity on the part of those who hold 
the <i>talent</i> of faith, <i>wrapping it in a napkin</i> instead of 
<i>trafficking</i> with it: wars and convulsions of civil society. At 
the same time, war rouses a nation; and the pressure of infidel 
criticism may and should develop a counter-energy in the Church.
