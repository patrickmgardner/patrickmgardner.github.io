<H1>That the Cause of Evil is good</h1>

What is not, is cause of nothing: every cause must be some being. But 
evil is not any being (Chapp. <A HREF="gc3_7.htm">VII</a>, <A 
HREF="gc3_8.htm">IX</a>): therefore evil cannot be the cause of 
anything.  If then evil is caused by anything, what causes it must be 
good.<p> 

4. Every cause is either material, formal, efficient, or final.  But 
evil can be neither matter nor form:  for it has been shown (Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc3_7.htm">VII</a>, <A HREF="gc3_8.htm">IX</a>) that both actual 
being and potential being is good.  In like manner evil cannot be an 
efficient cause, since everything acts according as it is actually and 
has a form.  Nor can it be a final cause, since it is beside the 
intention (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_4.htm">IV</a>). Evil therefore cannot be 
the cause of anything; and therefore, if there be any cause of evil, it 
must be caused by good.<p> 

But since good and evil are opposites, and one opposite cannot be cause 
of another except accidentally, it follows that good cannot be the 
active cause of evil except accidentally.  In physics, this accident 
may happen either on the part of the agent or on the part of the 
effect.  On the part of the agent, when the agent suffers from a lack 
of power, whence it follows that the action is defective and the effect 
deficient.  But to an agent, as such, it is quite an accident to suffer 
from a lack of power: for an agent does not act inasmuch as power is 
lacking to him, but according as he has anything of power.  Thus then 
evil is caused accidentally on the part of the agent, inasmuch as the 
agent runs short of power: therefore it is said that evil has not got 
an efficient cause, but a deficient cause, because evil does not follow 
from an efficient cause except in so far as it is deficient in power, 
and in this respect is is not efficient.  It comes to the same thing if 
the defect of the action and effect arises from some defect of the 
instrument, or of any other thing requisite for the agent's action, as 
when motive power produces halting through crookedness of the shin-bone: 
for the agent acts by both the power and the instrument.  On the 
part of the effect evil is caused accidentally as well in respect of 
the matter of the effect as also in respect of its form.  For if the 
matter is indisposed to receive the impression of the agent, some 
defect must follow in the effect.  Nor is it imputable to any defect of 
the agent, that it does not transmute an indisposed matter to a perfect 
act: for the power of every natural agent is determined according to 
the limit of its nature; and its failure to transcend that cannot be 
brought in against it as a defect in power: such defect can then only 
be argued when it falls short of the measure of power due to it by 
nature.  On the part of the form of the effect evil is accidentally 
incident, inasmuch as one form necessarily involves the privation of 
another form, and with the production of one thing there must needs 
ensue the destruction of another.  But this evil does not belong to the 
effect intended by the agent, but attaches to something else.  In the 
processes of nature therefore evil is caused by good only accidentally.  
The same is the case also in the processes of art: for art in its 
operation imitates nature, and is at fault in the same way as 
nature.<p> 

But in moral matters the case seems to be different.  For a flaw in 
morals does not follow from any lack of power, seeing that weakness 
either entirely removes, or at least diminishes, moral 
reprehensibleness: for weakness does not deserve the punishment which 
is due to fault, but rather compassion and indulgence: to be 
blameworthy, a point of conduct must be a voluntary act, not an 
inevitable necessity.  On careful consideration we find that the case 
of morals is in some respects like, in some respects unlike the case of 
physics. The unlikeness consists in this, that a moral fault is viewed 
as consisting in the action alone, not in any effect produced: for 
moral virtues are not effective, but active, while arts are effective; 
and therefore it has been said that art is at fault in the same way as 
nature.  Moral evil therefore is not estimated according to the matter 
and form of the effect, but follows simply from the agent.  Now in 
moral actions there are found in orderly enumeration four active 
principles.  One principle is the executive power, namely, the motor 
power which moves the limbs to execute the command of the will.  This 
power is moved by the will, and so the will is another principle.  The 
will is moved by the judgement of the apprehensive faculty, which 
judges the particular thing proposed to be good or bad. -- <i>good</i> 
and <i>bad</i> being the (formal) objects of the will, the one object 
of seeking, the other of avoidance.  Lastly, the apprehensive faculty 
is moved by the thing apprehended.  The first active principle then in 
moral actions is the thing apprehended; the second is the apprehensive 
faculty; the third is the will; the fourth is motor power which 
executes the command of reason.  But the act of the executive power 
already presupposes moral good or evil;<A HREF="gc3_10a.htm">*</a> for 
these exterior acts bear a moral character only in so far as they are 
voluntary.  Hence if the act of the will is good, the exterior act will 
also be called good; and evil, if the volition is evil.  It would be 
no point of moral badness for the exterior act to fail by some defect 
unconnected with the will: thus lameness is not a moral but a natural 
blemish. Such a lack of executive power diminishes, if it does not 
totally excuse from, moral blemish.  Again, the act whereby the object 
moves the apprehensive faculty is exempt from moral blemish: for it is 
according to the order of nature that what is visible affects the 
sight, and every object affects the corresponding passive potentiality.  
Even the act of the apprehensive faculty, considered in itself, is 
nowise morally blameworthy, as we see that any defect in it excuses 
from or diminishes moral blame, like the lack of executive power: for 
infirmity and ignorance alike excuse from sin, or diminish it.  It 
remains then that moral blameworthiness is found first and foremost in 
the act of the will alone; and reasonably so, since an act is called 
'moral' from being voluntary.  In the act of the will then is to be 
sought the root and origin of what in the moral order is sin.<p> 

But this investigation leads us into an apparent difficulty.  On the 
understanding that defect in an act arises from some defect in the 
principle of action, some defect in the will must be presupposed before 
there can be any moral fault.  If this defect is natural, it is ever 
inherent in the will; and the consequence is that the will must always 
do wrong in action, a consequence proved false by the fact of there 
being such things as acts of virtue.  On the other hand, if the defect 
is voluntary, that is already a moral fault, the cause of which must 
stand over for further enquiry; and so we shall have a running account 
to infinity.  We must therefore say that the defect pre-existing in the 
will is no natural necessity, otherwise it would follow that the will 
sinned in every act: nor again is a thing of chance and ill luck, for 
at that rate there could be in us no moral fault, since events of 
chance are unpremeditated and beyond the control of reason.  The defect 
therefore is voluntary, but not a moral fault: so we must suppose to 
save the account running to infinity.<p> 

Now we must consider how that can be.  In every active principle the 
perfection of its power depends on some superior active principle: for 
a secondary agent acts by virtue of the power of the prime agent.<A 
HREF="gc3_10b.htm">*</a> So long then as the secondary agent remains 
under the power of the prime agent, it will act unfailingly: but it 
will fail in its action whenever it happens to swerve from the order of 
the prime agent, as appears in an instrument when it ceases to respond 
to the movement of the agent who uses it.  Now it has been said above 
that in the order of moral actions principles go before volition, the 
apprehensive faculty and the object apprehended, which is the end in 
view. But since to everything movable there corresponds a proper motive 
power, not any and every apprehensive faculty is the due motive power 
of any and every appetite,<A HREF="gc3_10c.htm">*</a> but one 
apprehension is the proper motive of one appetite, another of another.  
As then the sensible apprehensive faculty is the proper motive power of 
the sensible appetite, so the proper motive power of the will is reason 
itself.  Further, as reason can apprehend many sorts of good things 
and many ends of action; as moreover every power has its own proper 
end; the will also must have some object and end of action and prime 
motive, and that must be not any and every sort of good, but some 
definite good. Whenever then the will tends to act under the motive of 
an apprehension of reason representing to it its own proper good, a due 
action ensues.  But when the will bursts out into action upon the 
apprehension of the sensible apprehensive faculty, or even upon the 
apprehension of reason itself, representing some other good than the 
proper good of the will, there ensues in the action of the will a moral 
fault.<A HREF="gc3_10d.htm">*</a> Therefore any faulty action in the 
will is preceded by a lack of due regard to reason and to the proper 
end of willing.  I say 'a lack of due regard to reason,' in such cases 
as when, upon some sudden aprehension of sense, the will tends to some 
good that is pleasant according to sense.  I say 'a lack of due regard 
to the proper end of willing,' in cases when the reason arrives by 
reasoning at some good, which is not either <i>now</i> or <i>in this 
way</i> good, and still the will tends to it as though it were its 
proper good. Now this lack of due regard is voluntary: for it is in the 
power of the will to will and not to will: it is likewise in its power to 
direct reason actually to consider or to cease from considering, or to 
consider this or that.<A HREF="gc3_10e.htm">*</a> Still this failure of 
due consideration is not a moral evil: for, consideration or no 
consideration, or whatever the consideration be on reason's part, there 
is not sin until the will comes to tend to some undue end, which then 
is an act of will. -- Thus it remains true that in moral as well as in 
physical actions, evil is not caused by good except accidentally.
