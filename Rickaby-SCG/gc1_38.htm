<H1>That God is His own Goodness<A HREF="gc1_38a.htm">*</a></h1>

EVERY good thing, that is not its own goodness, is called good by 
participation. But what is called good by participation presupposes 
something else before itself, whence it has received the character of 
goodness. This process cannot go to infinity, as there is no 
<i>processus in infinitum</i> in a series of final causes: for the 
infinite is inconsistent with any end, while good bears the character 
of an end.<A HREF="gc1_38b.htm">*</a> We must therefore arrive at some 
first good thing, which is not good by participation in reference to 
anything else, but is good by its own essence; and that is God. <P>

4. What is, may partake of something; but sheer being can partake of 
nothing. For that which partakes, is potentiality: but being is 
actuality. But God is sheer being, as has been proved (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_22.htm">XXII</a>) : He is not then good by participation, but 
essentially so.<A HREF="gc1_38c.htm">*</a><P> 

5. Every simple being has its existence and what it is, in one:<A 
HREF="gc1_38d.htm">*</a> if the two were different, simplicity would be 
gone. But God is absolute simplicity, as has been shown (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_18.htm">XVIII</a>): therefore the very goodness that is in 
Him is no other than His own very self.<P> 

The same reasoning shows that no other good thing is its own goodness: 
wherefore it is said: <i>None is good but God alone</i> (Mark x, 18; Luke 
xviii, 19).
