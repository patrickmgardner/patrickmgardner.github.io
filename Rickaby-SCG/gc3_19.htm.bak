<H1>That all Things aim at Likeness to God</h1>

All things evidently have a natural appetite for being, and resist 
destructive agencies wherever they are threatened with them.  But all 
things have being inasmuch as they are likened to God, who is the 
essential subsistent Being, all other things having being only by 
participation.  All things therefore have an appetite for likeness to 
God, making that their last end.<p>

for every agent acts to the production of its own likeness:<A

representing its original by likeness thereto: the image in fact is 
made on purpose.  All things then exist for the attaintment of the 
divine likeness; and that is their last end.<A
