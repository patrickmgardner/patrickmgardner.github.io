<H1>That they who see God see all things in Him at once</h1>

SINCE it has been shown that a created intelligence in seeing the 
divine substance understands therein all the species of things; since 
moreover all things that are seen by one presentation must be seen 
together by one vision; it necessarily follows that the intelligence 
which sees the divine substance views all things, not successively, but 
simultaneously. Hence Augustine says (<i>De Trinitate</i> XV, xvi): 
"Our thoughts will not then be unstable, coming and going from one 
thing to another, but we shall see all our knowledge together at one 
glance."<A HREF="gc3_60a.htm">*</a>
