<H1>That the Final Happiness of Man is not in this Life<A 
HREF="gc3_48a.htm">*</a></h1>

IF then human happiness does not consist in the knowledge of God 
whereby He is commonly known by all or most men according to some vague 
estimate, nor again in the knowledge of God whereby He is known 
demonstratively in speculative science, nor in the knowledge of God 
whereby He is known by faith, as has been shown above (Chapp. XXXVIII-XL); 
if again it is impossible in this life to arrive at a higher knowledge 
of God so as to know Him in His essence, or to understand other pure 
spirits, and thereby attain to a nearer knowledge of God (Chapp. XLI-XLVI); 
and still final happiness must be placed in some knowledge of God (Ch. 
XXXVII); it follows that it is impossible for the final happiness of 
man to be in this life.<p> 

2. The last end of man bounds his natural desire, so that, when that is 
reached, nothing further is sought: for if there is still a tendency to 
something else, the end of rest is not yet gained. But that cannot be 
in this life: for the more one understands, the more is the desire of 
understanding. natural to all men, increased.<A HREF="gc3_48b.htm">*</a><p> 

3. When one gains happiness, he gains also stability and rest. All have 
this idea of happiness, that it involves stability as a necessary 
condition: hence the philosopher says that we do not take man for a 
chameleon.<A HREF="gc3_48c.htm">*</a>  But in this life there is no 
stability: for however happy a man be called, sicknesses and 
misfortunes may always happen to debar him from that activity, whatever 
it is, wherein happiness consists.<p> 

4. It seems unfitting and irrational that the period of development 
should be great and the period of duration small: for it would follow 
that nature for the greater part of its time went without its final 
perfection. Hence we see that animals that live for a short time take a 
short time in arriving at maturity. But if human happiness consists in 
perfect activity according to perfect virtue, whether intellectual or 
moral, such happiness cannot accrue to man till after a long lapse of 
time; and this is especially apparent in speculative activity, in which 
the happiness of man is ultimately placed. For scarcely in extreme age 
can a man arrive [at] a perfect view of scientific truth;<A 
HREF="gc3_48d.htm">*</a> and then for the most part there is little of 
human life left.<p> 

5. That is the perfect good of happiness, which is absolutely free from 
admixture of evil, as that is perfect whiteness, which is absolutely 
unmingled with black. But it is impossible for man in the state of this 
life to be altogether free from evils, -- not to say bodily evils, as 
hunger, thirst, cold and heat, but even from evils of the soul. There 
is no man living who is not at times disturbed by inordinate passions, 
who does not at times overstep the mean in which virtue consists, or 
fall short of it, who is not in some things deceived, or ignorant of 
what he wishes to know, or driven to weak surmises on points where he 
would like absolute certainty.<p> 

6. Man naturally shrinks from death, and is sad at the thought of it.
Yet man must die, and therefore cannot be perfectly happy while here
he lives.<A HREF="gc3_48e.htm">*</a><p>

7. Happiness consists, not in habit, but in activity: for habits are 
for the sake of acts. But it is impossible in this life to do any act 
continually.<A HREF="gc3_48f.htm">*</a><p> 

8. The more a thing is desired and loved, the greater grief and sadness 
does its loss bring. But if final happiness be in this world, it will 
certainly be lost, at least by death; and it is uncertain whether it 
will last till death, since to any man there may possibly happen in 
this life diseases totally debarring him from any virtuous activity, 
such as insanity. Such happiness therefore must always have a natural 
pendent of sadness.<p> 

But it may be replied that whereas happiness is the good of an 
intelligent nature, true and perfect happiness belongs to those in whom 
intelligent nature is found in its perfection, that is, in pure 
spirits;<A HREF="gc3_48g.htm">*</a> but in man it is found imperfectly 
by way of a limited participation. And this seems to have been the mind 
of Aristotle: hence, enquiring whether misfortunes take away 
happiness, after showing that happiness lies in virtuous activities, 
which are the most permanent things in this life, he concludes that they 
who enjoy such perfection in this life are "happy for men," meaning 
that they do not absolutely attain happiness, but only in a human 
way.<A HREF="gc3_48h.htm">*</a><p> 

Now it is demonstrable that the aforesaid answer is not to the undoing 
of the arguments above alleged.<A HREF="gc3_48i.htm">*</a> For (a) 
though man is inferior in the order of nature to pure spirits, yet he 
is superior to irrational creatures; and therefore he must gain his 
final end in a more perfect way than they. But they gain their final 
end so perfectly as to seek nothing further. Thus the natural desire of 
dumb animals is at rest in the enjoyment of sensual delights. Much more 
must the natural desire of man be put to rest by his arrival at his 
last end. But that is impossible in this life: therefore it must be 
attained after this life.<A HREF="gc3_48j.htm">*</a><p> 

(b) It is impossible for a natural desire to be empty and vain: for 
nature does nothing in vain.  But the desire of nature (for happiness) 
would be empty and vain, if it never possibly could be fulfilled. 
Therefore this natural desire of man is fulfillable. But not in this 
life. Therefore it must be fulfilled after this life.<A 
HREF="gc3_48k.htm">*</a><p> 

Alexander and Averroes laid it down that the final happiness of man is 
not in such knowledge as is possible to man through the speculative 
sciences, but in a knowledge gained by conjunction with a separately 
subsistent intelligence, which conjunction they conceived to be 
possible to man in this life.  But because Aristotle saw that there was 
no other knowledge for man in this life than that which is through the 
speculative sciences, he supposed man not to gain perfect happiness, 
but a limited measure of happiness suited to his state. In all which 
investigation it sufficiently appears how hard pressed on this side and 
on that these fine geniuses (<i>praeclara ingenia</i>) were. From this 
stress of difficulty we shall find escape in positing, according to the 
proofs already given, that man can arrive at true happiness after this 
life, the soul of man being immortal.<A HREF="gc3_48l.htm">*</a> In 
this disembodied state the soul will understand in the way in which 
pure spirits understand (B. II, Chapp. <A HREF="gc2_96.htm">XCVI</a>, 
sq.) The final happiness of man then will be in the knowledge of God, 
which the human soul has after this life according to the manner in 
which pure spirits know Him.<p> 

Therefore the Lord promises us <i>reward in heaven</i> (Matt. v, 12), 
and says that the saints shall be <i>as the angels</i> (Matt. xxii, 
30), who <i>see the face of God in heaven</i> (Matt. xviii, 10).<p>
