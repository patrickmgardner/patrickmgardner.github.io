The conclusion might be expressed thus: In every created reality, or 
actuality, the actualisation, or realisation, is something distinct and 
separable from the thing actualised, or realised. This is not saying 
that the actualisation might be taken away, and the thing still remain. 
The distinction between essence and existence is not <i>physical</i>. 
But created essence has not such a hold on existence as to be incapable 
of losing it. This <i>loose hold</i> upon existence is taken by the 
Thomist school to involve a real distinction between essence and 
existence in creatures.
