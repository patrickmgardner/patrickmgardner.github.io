"There will be need too of external prosperity,
while man is man: for his nature is not self-sufficient
for contemplation, but needs a healthy body, food
and other comforts" (<i>Nic. Eth.</i>, X, ix, 1). The laying
to rest of all desire reminds us rather of Asiatic 
conceptions of happiness, involving the removal of work
and worry and of the consequences of sin, the most
accessible side of the concept of felicity, <i>mortalibus
aegris</i>. But to the Thomist and the Christian, desire
is appeased by full intensity of life (<i>contemplatio,</i>
<b>the&ocirc;ria</b>): to the Asiatic by an intellectual stillness
verging on <i>anaesthesia</i> (<i>nirv&acirc;na</i>). We pray for <i>requiem
aeternam</i>, likewise for <i>lux perpetua</i>; but to the perfect
Buddhist <i>nirv&acirc;na</i> is simply extinction. Buddhism is
the antithesis of the scholastic thesis, <i>ens est bonum</i>.
