<H1>In what sense some things are said to be Impossible to the 
Almighty</h1> 

In God there is active power, but no potentiality. Now possibility is 
spoken of both as involving active power and as involving potentiality. 
Those things then are impossible to God, the possibility of which would 
mean in Him potentiality. Examples: God cannot be any material thing: 
He cannot suffer change, nor defect, nor fatigue, nor forgetfulness, 
nor defeat, nor violence, nor repentance, anger, or sadness.<p>

Again, since the object and effect of active power is some produced 
reality, it must be said to be impossible for God to make or produce 
anything inconsistent with the notion of 'reality,' or 'being,' as 
such, or inconsistent with the notion of a reality that is 'made,' or 
'produced,' inasmuch as it is 'made,' or 'produced.' Examples: God 
cannot make one and the same thing together to be and not to be. He 
cannot make opposite attributes to be in the same subject in the same 
respect. He cannot make a thing wanting in any of its essential 
constituents, while the thing itself remains: for instance, a man 
without a soul.<A HREF="gc2_25a.htm">*</a> Since the principles of some 
sciences, as logic, geometry, and arithmetic, rest on the formal, or 
abstract, constituents on which the essence of a thing depends, it 
follows that God cannot effect anything contrary to these principles, 
as that genus should not be predicable of species, or that lines drawn 
from the centre of a circle to the circumference should not be equal. 
God cannot make the past not to have been. Some things also God cannot 
make, because they would be inconsistent with the notion of a creature, 
as such: thus He cannot create a God, or make anything equal to 
Himself, or anything that shall maintain itself in being, independently 
of Him. He cannot do what He cannot will: He cannot make Himself cease 
to be, or cease to be good or happy; nor can He will anything evil, or 
sin. Nor can His will be changeable: He cannot therefore cause what He 
has once willed not to be fulfilled.<A HREF="gc2_25b.htm">*</a> There 
is however this difference between this last impossibility on God's 
part and all others that have been enumerated. The others are absolute 
impossibilities for God either to will or do: but the things now spoken 
of God might will and do if His will or power be considered absolutely, 
but not if it be considered under the presupposition of His will to the 
contrary. And therefore all such phrases as, 'God cannot act contrary 
to what He has arranged to do,' are to be understood <i>in sensu 
composito</i>; but, understood <i>in sensu diviso</i>, they are false, 
for in that sense they regard the power and will of God considered 
absolutely.<A HREF="gc2_25c.htm">*</a><p>
