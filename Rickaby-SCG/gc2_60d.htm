In the Aristotelian terminology, the 'first actuality' is the being in 
readiness to act, the 'second actuality' is the being in action. A 
locomotive with steam up is in the 'first actuality ': a locomotive on 
its way is in the 'second actuality.' We must secure the 'first 
actuality' of science and skill, before we can exercise the 'second 
actuality ' of a skilful scientific investigation. St Thomas quotes 
Aristotle, <i>De anima</i>, II, i: "This actuality is understood in two 
senses: the first is represented by habitual knowledge, the second by 
the actual use of the understanding to mark a truth. Wherefore soul is 
defined, 'the first actuality of living body.'"<p>
