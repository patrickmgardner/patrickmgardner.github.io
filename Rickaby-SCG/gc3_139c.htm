Nevertheless it remains in the highest degree
desirable that the vows of religion be heartily observed
and never regretted. To serve this end, a novitiate
is prefixed to the taking of them, that they may be
appreciated, desired, and made matter of habitual
practice before they come to bind. And after they
are taken, the love of them is kept up by constant
meditation and prayer. Like the words of our Saviour
in the Gospel, the vows of religion are misinterpreted
and misjudged in the abstract, away from the concrete
facts which attend their first pronouncement and their
habitual observance.
