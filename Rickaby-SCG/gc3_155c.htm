Obviously, there is danger of illusion in these
visions, locutions, and inner lights. No man is more
suspicious of such things than the average Catholic
priest. A priest from his training gets the mind of a
lawyer: he loves Church law and public teaching, and
reckons less of the private wisdom of individuals. 
Catholic faith stands clear of private revelations. Such
are not the ordinary channels whereby God teaches
His mysteries to men. The ordinary channel is the
Word Incarnate and His living Church on earth, a
visible external authority. Certainly, every Christian
man has his 'inner light,' but that light is none other
than the grace of faith, enabling him and prompting
him to believe, as on God's word, what the Church
teaches him as revealed in Christ.
