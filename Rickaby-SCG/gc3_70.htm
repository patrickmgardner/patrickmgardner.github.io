<H1>How the Same Effect is from God and from a Natural Agent</h1>

SOME find it difficult to understand how natural effects are 
attributable At once to God and to a natural agent. For (<i>Arg. 1</i>) 
one action, it seems, cannot proceed from two agents. If then the 
action, by which a natural effect is produced, proceeds from a natural 
body, it does not proceed from God.<p> 

<i>Arg. 2.</i> When an action can be sufficiently done by one, it is 
superfluous to have it done by more: we see that nature does not do 
through two instruments what she can do through one. Since then the 
divine power is sufficient to produce natural effects, it is 
superfluous to employ also natural powers for the production of those 
same effects. Or if the natural power sufficiently produces its own 
effect, it is superfluous for the divine power to act to the same 
effect.<p> 

<i>Arg. 3.</i> If God produces the whole natural effect, nothing of the 
effect is left for the natural agent to produce.<p> 

Upon consideration, these arguments are not difficult.<p>

<i>Reply 1.</i> The power of the inferior agent depends upon the power 
of the superior agent, inasmuch as the superior agent gives to the 
inferior the power whereby it acts, or preserves that power, or applies 
it to action; as a workman applies a tool to its proper effect, 
frequently however without giving the tool the form whereby it acts,<A 
HREF="gc3_70a.htm>*</a> nor preserving it, but merely giving it motion. 
The action therefore of the inferior agent must proceed from that agent 
not merely through its own power, but through the power of all superior 
agents, for it acts in virtue of them all. And as the ultimate and 
lowest agent acts immediately, so is the power of the prime agent 
immediate in the production of the effect. For the power of the lowest 
agent is not competent to produce the effect of itself, but in power of 
the agent next above it; and the power of that agent is competent in 
virtue of the agent above it; and thus the power of the highest agent 
proves to be of itself productive of the effect, as the immediate 
cause, as we see in the principles of mathematical demonstrations, of 
which the first principle is inimediate.<A HREF="gc3_70b.htm>*</a> As 
then it is not absurd for the same action to be produced by an agent 
and the power of that agent, so neither is it absurd for the same 
effect to be produced by an inferior agent and by God, by both 
immediately, although in different manners.<p> 

<i>Reply 2.</i> Though a natural thing produces its own effect, it is 
not superfluous for God to produce it, because the natural thing does 
not produce it except in the power of God. Nor is it superfluous, while 
God can of Himself produce all natural effects, for them to be produced 
by other causes: this is not from the insufficiency of God's power, but 
from the immensity of His goodness, whereby He has wished to 
communicate His likeness to creatures, not only in point of their 
being, but likewise in point of their being causes of other things 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc3_21.htm">XXI</a>).<p> 

<i>Reply 3.</i> When the same effect is attributed to a natural cause 
and to the divine power, it is not as though the effect were produced 
partly by God and partly by the natural agent: but the whole effect is 
produced by both, though in different ways, as the same effect is 
attributed wholly to the instrument, and wholly also to the principal 
agent.<A HREF="gc3_70c.htm>*</a>
