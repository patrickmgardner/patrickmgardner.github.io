Even the motion of the whole universe may be regarded as one 
stupendous particular case of motion. Left to physical causes alone, 
the universe must run down like a clock, all positions of advantage 
being lost, all potential energy being converted into kinetic, one 
uniform temperature and one dead equilibrium of forces coming to obtain 
everywhere. This is an argument that motion and time must have had a 
beginning. Had the universe been at work from eternity, its capacity of 
work would have been exhausted ere now.
