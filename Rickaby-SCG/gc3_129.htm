<H1>That the things commanded by the Divine Law are Right, not only 
because the Law enacts them, but also according to Nature</h1>

BY the precepts of the divine law the human mind is subordinated to 
God, and all the rest of man is subordinated to reason. But this is 
just what natural order requires, that the inferior be subject to 
the superior. Therefore the things commanded by the divine law are in 
themselves naturally right.<p> 

2. Divine providence has endowed men with a natural tribunal of reason 
(<i>naturale judicatorium rationis</i>), to be the ruling principle of 
their proper activities. But natural principles are ordained to natural 
purposes. There are certain activities naturally suited to man, and 
these activities are in themselves right, and not merely by positive 
law.<A HREF="gc3_129a.htm">*</a><p> 

3. Where there is a definite nature, there must be definite activities 
proper to that nature: for the proper activity of every nature is 
consequent upon the nature. Now it is certain that men's nature is 
definite.<A HREF="gc3_129b.htm">*</a> There must therefore be certain 
activities that in themselves befit man.<p> 

4. Wherever a thing is natural to any one, any other thing also is 
natural, without which the first thing cannot be had, for nature fails 
not in necessities. But it is natural to man to be a social animal. 
Those things therefore naturally befit man, without which the 
maintenance of human society would be impossible. Such things are the 
securing to every man of his own, and abstinence from wrongdoing. Some 
points therefore of human conduct are naturally right.<p> 

5. The use of lower creatures to meet the need of human life is a 
natural property of man. Now there is a certain measure in which the 
use of the aforesaid creatures is helpful to human life. If this 
measure is transgressed, as in the disorderly taking of food, it 
results in harm to man. There are therefore certain human acts 
naturally appropriate, and others naturally inappropriate.<p> 

6. In the natural order man's body is for his soul, and the lower 
powers of the soul for reason. It is therefore naturally right for man 
so to manage his body and the lower faculties of his soul as that the 
act and good of reason may least of all be hindered, but rather helped. 
Mismanagement in this regard must naturally be sinful. We count 
therefore as things naturally evil carousings and revellings and the 
disorderly indulgence of the sexual instinct, whereby the act of reason 
is impeded and subjected to the passions, which do not leave the 
judgement of the reason free.<p> 

7. To every man those things are naturally befitting, whereby he tends 
to his natural end; and the contraries are naturally unbefitting. But 
God is the end to which man is ordained by nature (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_115.htm">CXV</a>). Those things therefore are naturally 
right, whereby man is led to the knowledge and love of God; and the 
contraries are naturally evil for man.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>The judgements of the Lord are righteous, having 
their justification in themselves</i> (Ps. xviii, 10).<p> 

Hereby is excluded the tenet of those who say that things just and right
are the creation of positive law.
