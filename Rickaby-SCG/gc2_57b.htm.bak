There is no such saying in the works of Plato: but Aristotle, <i>De 
anima</i>, lib. II, c. i, <i>ad fin.</i>, mentions it as "a point not 
cleared up, whether the soul is the form of the body in the same sense 
as a sailor is of his boat," probably referring to a saying which he 
had heard from his master Plato, and did not agree with.
