  <A HREF="gc.htm"> Of God and His Creatures</a><hr>

<H1>That the things that are said God and Creatures are said 
analogously</h1> 

THUS then from the foregoing arguments the conclusion remains that 
things said alike of God and of other beings are not said either in 
quite the same sense, or in a totally different sense, but in an 
analogous sense, that is, in point of order or regard to some one 
object. And this happens in two ways: in one way inasmuch as many 
things have regard to one particular, as in regard to the one point of 
health an animal is called 'healthy' as being the subject of health 
medicine is called 'healthful' as being productive of health; food is 
'healthy,' being preservative of health; urine, as being a sign of 
health: in another way, inasmuch as we consider the order or regard of 
two things, not to any third thing, but to one of the two, as 'being' 
is predicated of substance and accident inasmuch as accident is 
referred to substance, not that substance and accident are referred to 
any third thing. Such names then as are predicated of God and of other 
beings are not predicated analogously in the former way of analogy -- for 
then we should have to posit something before God -- but in the latter 
way.<A HREF="gc1_34a.htm">*</a><P> 

In this matter of analogous predication we find sometimes the same 
order in point of name and in point of thing named, sometimes not the 
same. The order of naming follows the order of knowing, because the 
name is a sign of an intelligible concept. When then that which is 
prior in point of fact happens to be also prior in point of knowledge, 
there is one and the same priority alike in point of the concept 
answering to the name and of the nature of the thing named. Thus 
substance is prior to accident by nature, inasmuch as substance is the 
cause of accident;<A HREF= "gc1_34b.htm">*</a> and prior also in 
knowledge, inasmuch as substance is put in the definition of accident; 
and therefore 'being' is predicated of substance before it is 
predicated of accident, alike in point of the nature of the thing and 
in point of the concept attaching to the name.<A 
HREF="gc1_34c.htm">*</a>  But when what is prior in nature is posterior 
in knowledge, in such cases of analogy there is not the same order 
alike in point of the thing named and in point of the concept attaching 
to the name. Thus the power of healing, that is in healing remedies, is 
prior by nature to the health that is in the animal, as the cause is 
prior to the effect: but because this power is known from its effect, 
it is also named from its effect: hence, though 'healthful' or 'health-
producing,' is prior in order of fast, yet the application of the 
predicate 'healthy' to the animal is prior in point of the concept 
attaching to the name. Thus then, because we arrive at the knowledge of 
God from the knowledge of other realities, the thing signified by the 
names that we apply in common to God and to those other realities -- 
the thing signified, I say, is by priority in God, in the mode proper 
to God: but the concept attaching to the name is posterior in its 
application to Him: hence He is said to be named from the effects which 
He causes.<A HREF="gc1_34d.htm">*</a>
