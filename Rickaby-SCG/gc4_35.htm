<H1>Against the Error of Eutyches</h1>

EUTYCHES,<A HREF="gc4_35a.htm">*</a> to save the unity of person in 
Christ against Nestorius, said that in Christ there was only one 
nature. He went on to explain how before the union there were two 
distinct natures, one divine and one human; but in the union they both 
met so as to form one. He said then that the person of Christ was 
<i>of</i> two natures, but did not subsist <i>in</i> two natures. The 
falsity of this statement is apparent on many counts.<p> 

1. In Christ Jesus there was a Body, and a natural Soul, and the 
Divinity. The Body of Christ, even after the union, was not the 
Divinity of the Word: for the Body of Christ, even after the union, was 
passible, visible to bodily eyes, and distinct in lineaments and limbs, 
all of which attributes are alien to the Divinity of the Word. In like 
manner the Soul of Christ after union was distinct from the Divinity of 
the Word, because the Soul of Christ, even after the union, was 
affected by the passions of sadness and grief and anger (Mark iii, 5: 
xiv, 34), which again can in no way be adapted to the Divinity of the 
Word. But soul and body make up human nature. Thus then, even after 
union, there was a human nature in Christ, other than the Divinity of 
the Word, which is the divine nature.<p> 

2. <i>Being in the form of God, he took the form of a servant</i> 
(Phil. ii, 6, 7). It cannot be said that the form of God and the form 
of a servant are the same, for nothing takes that which it already has. 
In Eutyches's view, Christ having already the form of God, could not 
have taken the form of a servant, the two being the same. Nor can it be 
said that the form of God in Christ was changed by the union, for so 
Christ after the union would not be God. Nor again can it be said that 
the form of the servant was mingled with the form of God, for mingled 
elements do not remain entire, but both are partially changed: hence it 
should not be said that He had taken the form of a servant, but 
something of that form. Thus the Apostle's words must mean that in 
Christ, even after union, there were two forms, therefore two 
natures.<p> 

3. If we suppose a blending of both natures, divine and human, neither 
would remain, but some third thing; and thus Christ would be neither 
God nor man. Eutyches then cannot be understood to mean that one nature 
was made out of the two. He can only mean that after union only one of 
the natures remained. Either then in Christ only the divine nature 
remained, and what seemed in Him human was merely phenomenal, as the 
Manicheans said; or the divine nature was changed into a human nature, 
as Apollinaris said: against both of whom we have argued above (Chapp. 
<A HREF="gc4_29.htm">XXIX</a>, XXXI).<p> 

5. When one nature is constituted of two permanent components, these 
components are either bodily parts, like the limbs of an animal, a case 
not in point here, or they are matter and form, like body and soul: but 
God is not matter, nor can He stand to any matter in the relation of 
form. Therefore in Christ, true God and true Man, there cannot be one 
nature only.<p> 

7. Where there is no agreement in nature, there is no specific 
likeness. If then the nature of Christ is a compound of divine and 
human, there will be no specific likeness between Him and us, contrary 
to the saying of the Apostle: <i>He ought in all things to be made like 
to his brethren</i> (Heb. ii, 17).<p> 

9. Even this saying of Eutyches seems inconsistent with the faith, that
there were two natures in Christ before the union: for as human nature is
made up of body and soul, it would follow that either the soul, or the body
of Christ, or both, existed before the Incarnation, which is evidently false.
