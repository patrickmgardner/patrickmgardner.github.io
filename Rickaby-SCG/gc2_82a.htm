The irrationality of dumb animals is apparent from this, first, that 
they are <i>dumb</i> (<b>alogoi</b>), or devoid of rational speech; 
secondly, that they are <i>uncivilised</i>, and uncivilisable, except 
in so far as they partake of the civilisation of man; thirdly that, 
apart from man, they are racially <i>unprogressive</i>; fourthly, that 
they are devoid of all idea of morality and religion; fifthly, that 
there is <i>no inter-breeding</i> between them and even the lowest types 
of the one incontestably rational animal, man.  The indefeasible 
coexistence of human shape and animal rationality is as well 
established as any coexistence in physical science.  But, setting aside 
spiders and swallows, it is not true that monkeys, elephants, horses, 
dogs, and other educable animals, in their respective species, "all 
behave alike."  St Thomas however may claim to speak only of animals in 
a state of nature, wholly uninfluenced by man.
