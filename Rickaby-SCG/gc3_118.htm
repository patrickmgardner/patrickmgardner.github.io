<H1>That by Divine Law men are obliged to a Right Faith</h1>

AS sight by the bodily eye is the principle of the bodily passion of 
love, so the beginning of spiritual love must be the intellectual vision 
of some object of the same. But the vision of that spiritual object of 
understanding, which is God, cannot be had at present by us except 
through faith, because God exceeds our natural reason, especially if we 
consider Him in that regard under which our happiness consists in 
enjoying Him.<p> 

2. The divine law directs man to be entirely subject to God. But as man 
will is subjected to God by loving Him, so his understanding is 
subjected to Him by believing Him, -- but not by believing anything 
false, because no falsehood can be proposed to man by God, who is the 
truth: hence he who believes anything false does not believe God.<p> 

3. Whoever holds an erroneous view about a thing, touching the essence 
of the thing, does not know the thing. Thus if any one were to fix on 
the notion of irrational animal, and take that to be man, he would not 
know man. The case would be otherwise, if he was mistaken only about 
some of the accidents of man. But in the case of compound beings, 
though he who errs about any of the essentials of a thing does not know 
the thing, absolutely speaking, still he knows it in a sort of a way: 
thus he who thinks man to be an irrational animal knows him 
generically: but in the case of simple beings this cannot be, -- any 
error shuts out entirely all knowledge of the thing. But God is to the 
utmost degree simple. Therefore whoever errs about God does not know 
God. Thus he who believes God to be corporeal has no sort of knowledge 
of God, but apprehends something else instead of God.<A 
HREF="gc3_118a.htm">*</a> Now as a thing is known, so is it loved and 
desired. He then who errs concerning God, can neither love Him nor 
desire Him as his last end. Since then the divine law aims at bringing 
men to love and desire God, that same law must bind men to have a right 
faith concerning God.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Without faith it is impossible to please God</i> 
(Heb. xi, 6); and at the head of all other precepts of the law there is 
prescribed a right faith in God: <i>Hear, O Israel: the Lord thy God is 
one Lord</i> (Deut. vi, 4).<p>
