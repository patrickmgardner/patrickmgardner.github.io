St Thomas here is not denying, what he throughout 
supposes, that in this life our acceptance (<i>intentio,
inhaesio, desiderium ultimi finis</i>) of anything as our 
last end is a free act. He is merely quoting Aristotle as
sufficient authority for his present purpose. Aristotle's
words are in <i>Eth. Nic.</i> III, iv, 8. Cf. <i>Aquinas Ethicus</i>,
I, pp. 51-54: <i>Political and Moral Essays</i>, p. 250. -- Free
will goes with deliberation. We mortal men find ourselves 
deliberating continually about means, but very
rarely about ends. Character is said to become 'formed'
as time advances: that is to say, some definite view of
the meaning and purpose of life comes to be finally
adopted: or, in Thomistic phraseology, 'the will of
the last end becomes fixed,' practically speaking, 
before death; and if so, he would argue, much more in
death. A conversion or perversion, that is to say, a
total change of front for better or worse, does not
occur in mature life, except where a series of choices
and preferences has for years been leading up to such
a consummation. We must not look for conversions
beyond the tomb, nor, happily, for perversions either.
