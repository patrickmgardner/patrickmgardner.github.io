But the vigour of a natural constitution is of
no avail for restoring life, once it is interrupted by
death. And mortal sin is death. The whole question
is whether mortal sin is such a death as to be, in
God's ordinary providence, beyond resurrection.
This point cannot be determined <i>a priori</i>. Apart
from His promises, God is not bound ever to forgive
any mortal sin. Whether He will forgive, and on
what conditions, depends on His free good pleasure,
and that is ascertainable only by revelation, and its
vehicle, Christian tradition.
