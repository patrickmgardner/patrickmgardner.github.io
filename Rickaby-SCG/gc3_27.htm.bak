<H1>That the Happiness of Man does not consist in Bodily Pleasures</h1>

ACCORDING to the order of nature, pleasure is for the sake of activity, 
and not the other way about. If therefore certain activities are not 
the final end, the pleasures ensuing upon these activities are neither 
the final end nor accessories of the final end. But certainly the 
activities on which bodily pleasures follow are not the final end: for 
they are directed to other obvious ends, the preservation of the body 
and the begetting of offspring. Therefore the aforesaid pleasures are 
not the final end, nor accessories of the final end, and happiness is 
not to be placed in them.<p> 

3. Happiness is a good proper to man: dumb animals cannot be called 
happy except by an abuse of language.<A HREF="gc3_27a.htm">*</a> But 
bodily pleasures are common to man and brute: happiness therefore 
cannot consist in them.<A HREF="gc3_27b.htm">*</a><p> 

4. The final end of a thing is noblest and best of all that appertains 
to the thing.<A HREF="gc3_27c.htm">*</a> But bodily delights do not 
appertain to a man in respect of what is noblest in him.<p> 

5. The highest perfection of man cannot consist in his being conjoined 
with things lower than himself, but in his conjunction with something 
above him.<p> 

7. In all things that are said to be 'ordinarily' (per se), 'more' 
follows upon 'more,' if 'absolutely' goes with 'absolutely.' If then 
bodily pleasures were good in themselves,<A HREF="gc3_27d.htm">*</a> to 
take them to the utmost would be the best way of taking them. But this 
is manifestly false: for excessive use of such things is accounted a 
vice, injures the body, and bars further enjoyments of the same sort.<A 
HREF="gc3_27e.htm">*</a><p> 

8. If human happiness consisted in bodily pleasures, it would be a more 
praiseworthy act of virtue to take such pleasures than to abstain from 
them.<A HREF="gc3_27f.htm">*</a> But this is manifestly false, for it 
is the special praise of the act of temperance to abstain from such 
pleasures.<A HREF="gc3_27g.htm">*</a><p> 

9. The last end of everything is God (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc3_18.htm">XVIII</a>). That then must be laid down to be the 
last end of man, whereby he most closely approaches to God. But bodily 
pleasures injure a man from any close approach to God: for God is 
approached by contemplation, and the aforesaid pleasures are a 
hindrance to contemplation.<p> 

Hereby is excluded the error of the Epicureans, who placed the 
happiness of man in these pleasures: in whose person Solomon says: 
<i>This seemed to me good, that man should eat and drink and make merry 
on the fruit of his toil</i> (Eccles. V, 17). <i>Everywhere let us 
leave behind us signs of mirth, for this is our portion and this our 
lot</i> (Wisd. ii, 9). Also the error of the followers of Cerinthus is 
excluded, who spread the fable of a thousand years of the pleasures of 
the belly as an element in the kingdom of Christ after the 
resurrection, hence they are called Chiliasts, or Millennarians. Also 
the fables of the Saracens, who place the rewards of the just in the 
aforesaid pleasures.
