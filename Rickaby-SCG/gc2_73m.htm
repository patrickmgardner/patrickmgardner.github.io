It is supposed (<i>ad hominem</i>) that the potential intellect is 
eternal. -- Yet somehow the argument here seems to miss the point. The 
Commentator never said that the presentations in the eternal potential 
intellect depended on the phantasms of any individual. He never likened 
those presentations to the individual's fleeting visual impressions of 
things: but he likened the presentations in the eternal intellect to 
things, and the phantasms of the individual to his visual impressions 
of things. Averroes contended that 'forms,' or aspects of things, exist 
in two ways, in both eternally: (a) materially, in sensible things, the 
world being eternal, in which sensible things these forms are 
potentially intelligible, being abstracted thence by intellect: (b) 
intellectually, in the eternal intellect, which is at once potential 
and active. He added that the same forms had an intellectual existence 
in a third way, namely, a temporal existence in the mind of this and 
that individual, which mind is 'continued,' or 'conjoined' for a time 
with the eternal intellect: this asserted 'continuation' of the 
temporal with the eternal is the theme of contention between Averroes 
and St Thomas.<p>

St Thomas might refit his argument (as indeed he does presently) by 
demanding how intellectual presentations come to be in this supposed 
one eternal intellect, whether by abstraction from previous phantasms 
or not. To say that the potential intellect had impressions independent 
of previous phantasms, would put the Commentator in flat contradiction 
with Aristotle; e.g., <i>De anima</i>, III, vii, 3, 4: "To the 
intellectual soul phantasms are as sense-perceptions: wherefore the 
soul never understands without a phantasm." On the other hand, if 
phantasms are presupposed, there must have been phantasms also from 
eternity: how otherwise could an eternal mind depend on phantasms for 
all its content?
