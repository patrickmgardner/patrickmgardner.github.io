<H1>Objections against the Faith of the Incarnation, with Replies</h1>

ARG. 1. If God has taken flesh, He must be either changed into a body, 
or be some power resident in a body.<p> 

<i>Reply 1</i>. The Incarnation does not mean either the conversion of 
the Word into flesh, or the union of the Word with a human body as the 
form of the same.<p> 

<i>Arg. 2</i>. If the person of the Word of God acquires a new 
subsistence in a human nature, it must undergo a substantial change, as 
everything is changed that acquires a new nature.<p> 

<i>Reply 2</i>. The change is not in the Word of God, but in the human 
nature assumed by the Word.<p> 

<i>Arg. 3</i>. If the personality of the Word of God has become the 
personality of a human nature, it follows that since the Incarnation 
the Word of God has not been everywhere, as that human nature is not 
everywhere.<p> 
          
<i>Reply 3</i>. Personality does not extend beyond the bounds of that 
nature from which it has its subsistence. But the Word of God has not 
its subsistence from its human nature, but rather draws that human 
nature to its own subsistence or personality: for it does not subsist 
through it, but in it.<p> 

<i>Arg. 4</i>. One and the same thing has only one quiddity, substance, 
or nature. It seems impossible therefore for one person to subsist in 
two natures.<p> 

<i>Reply 4</i>. The assertion is true, if you speak of the nature 
whereby a thing has being, absolutely speaking; and so, absolutely 
speaking, the Word of God has being by the divine nature alone, not by 
the human nature. But by the human nature it has being as Man.<p> 

<i>Arg. 8</i>. Soul and body in Christ are of not less potency than 
they are in other men. But their union in other men constitutes a 
person: therefore also in Christ.<p> 

<i>Reply 8</i>. The human soul and body in Christ being drawn into the 
personality of the Word, and not constituting another person besides 
the person of the Word, does not mark a diminution of potency, but a 
greater excellence. Everything is better for being united to what is 
more excellent than itself, better than it was, or would be, if it 
stood by itself.<A HREF="gc4_40a.htm">*</a><p> 

<i>Arg. 10</i>. This man, who is Christ, considered merely as made up 
of soul and body, is a substance: but not a universal, therefore a 
particular substance: therefore a person.<p> 

<i>Reply 10</i>. Yes, He is a person, but no other person than the 
person of the Word: because the human nature has been so assumed by the 
person of the Word that the Word subsists as well in the human as in 
the divine nature: but what subsists in human nature is 'this man': 
therefore the Word Himself is spoken of<A HREF="gc4_40b.htm">*</a> when 
we say 'this Man.'<p> 

<i>Arg. 11</i>. If the personality of the divine and human nature in 
Christ is the same, divine personality must be part of the notion of 
the Man who is Christ. But it is not part of the notion of other men. 
Therefore the application of the common term 'man' to Christ and to 
other men is an instance of the use of the same term not in the same 
sense; and thus He will not be of the same species with us. <p> 

<i>Reply 11</i>. Variation of the sense of a term comes from diversity 
of form connoted, not from diversity of person denoted. The term 'man' 
does not vary in sense by denoting sometimes Plato, sometimes 
Socrates.<A HREF="gc4_40c.htm">*</a> The term 'man' then, whether used 
of Christ or of other men, always connotes the same form, that is, 
human nature, and is predicated of them all in the same sense. But the 
denotation varies in this that, as taken for Christ, the term denotes 
an uncreated person; but as taken for other men, a created person.
