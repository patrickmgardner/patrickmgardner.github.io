St Gregory Nazianzen in his poem <i>Against
Apollinaris</i>, 50 sq., asks how two things so far apart
as Deity and humanity could be united, and replies:
<pre>
  'Tis mystery, I but conjecture make.
  Divinity with flesh unmeet to blend:
  But thinking Soul, as 'twere a frontier power,
  Image of God, in body domiciled,
  Is apt to mediate between the twain.
  The Godhead then conjoined itself with Soul,
  And so assumed dimensions of a man.
</pre>
