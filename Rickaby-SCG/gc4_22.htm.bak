<H1>Of the Effects attributed to the Holy Ghost in the attraction of the 
Rational Creature to God</h1>

IT is a mark of friendship to take delight in the company of one's 
friend, to rejoice at what he says and does, and to find in him comfort 
and consolation against all troubles: hence it is in our griefs 
especially that we fly to our friends for comfort. Since then the Holy 
Ghost renders us friends of God, making Him to dwell in us and we in 
Him, we have through the same Holy Spirit joy in God and comfort under 
all the adversities and assaults of the world: hence it is said: 
<i>Give me back the joy of thy salvation, and strengthen me with thy 
guiding Spirit</i> (Ps. l, 14): <i>The kingdom of God is justice and 
peace and joy in the Holy Ghost</i> (Rom. xiv, 17): <i>The Church had 
peace, and was edified, walking in the fear of the Lord, and filled 
with the consolation of the Holy Ghost</i> (Acts ix, 31).<p> 

Another mark of friendship is to fall in with a friend's wishes. Now 
God's wishes are unfolded to us by His commandments, the keeping of 
which therefore is part of our love of God : <i>If ye love me, keep my 
commandments</i> (John xiv, 15). As then we are rendered lovers of God 
by the Holy Ghost, by Him we are also led to fulfil God's commandments: 
<i>Whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, the same are the sons of 
God</i> (Rom. viii, 14). But it is a noteworthy point that the sons of 
God are led by the Holy Ghost, not as bondsmen, but as free. He is 
free, who is a cause unto himself;<A HREF="gc4_22a.htm">*</a> and we do 
that freely which we do of ourselves, that is, of our own willing; but 
what we do against our will, we do, not freely, but after the manner of 
bondsmen. The Holy Ghost then, rendering us lovers of God, inclines us 
to act of our own will, freely, out of love, not as bondsmen prompted 
by fear. <i>Ye have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear, 
but ye have received the spirit of adoption as sons</i> (Rom. viii, 
15). True good being the object of the will, whenever a man turns away 
from true good under the influence of passion or ill habit, and so is 
swayed by a power foreign to his proper self, he in that respect 
behaves like a bondsman. On the other hand, if we consider his act as a 
genuine act of his will, inclined to what is good for him in his own 
eyes, although not really good, he acts freely in thus following 
passion or corrupt habit. But again he acts like a bondsman, if, while 
the volition of fancied good just mentioned remains, he nevertheless 
abstains from what he wills for fear of the law enacted to the 
contrary. Since then the Holy Ghost inclines the will by love to true 
good, its natural object, He takes away alike the servitude whereby, a 
slave to passion and sin, man acts against the due order of his will, 
and that other servitude whereby man acts according to the law, but 
against the motion of his will, like a slave of the law and no friend 
to it. Hence the Apostle says: <i>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, 
there is liberty</i> (2 Cor. iii, 17): <i>If ye are led by the Spirit, ye 
are not under the law (Gal. v, 18)<A HREF="gc4_22b.htm">*</a>
