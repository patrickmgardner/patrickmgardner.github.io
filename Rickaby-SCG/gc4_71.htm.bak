<h1>That a man who sins after the Grace of the Sacraments may be 
converted to Grace<A HREF="gc4_71a.htm">*</a></h1>

HEREBY is excluded the error of the Novatians, who denied pardon to 
sinners after baptism.<A HREF="gc4_71b.htm">*</a> They took occasion of 
their error from the text: <i>It is impossible for those who have been 
once enlightened</i> [<b>ph&ocirc;tisthentas</b>, baptised], <i>and 
have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy 
Ghost . . . . and have fallen, to be again renewed</i> 
[<b>anakainizein</b>, <i>renovari</i>, Vulg.] <i>unto penance</i> (Heb. 
vi, 4, 6). But the sense is plain from the immediate context: 
<i>crucifying to themselves again the Son of God, and making him a 
mockery</i>. There is denied to them then that renewal unto penance, 
whereby a man is <i>crucified along with Christ</i>, which is by 
baptism: <i>for as many of us as have been baptised in Christ Jesus, 
have been baptised in his death</i> (Rom. vi, 3, 6: Gal. ii, 19, 20: v, 
24). As then Christ is not to be crucified again, so he who sins after 
baptism is not to be baptised again. Hence the Apostle does not say 
that it is impossible for such persons to be reclaimed, or converted, 
to penance, but that it is impossible for them to be renewed 
[<b>anakainizein</b>], renovation being the effect usually ascribed to 
baptism, which is called the laver of regeneration and renewal 
[<b>anakain&ocirc;se&ocirc;s</b>] (Titus iii, 5).
