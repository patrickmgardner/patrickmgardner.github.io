Avicenna's theory tends to make the  active intellect from without 
supply the potential intellect with intelligible forms: in which  case 
phantasms cease to be necessary as a previous condition for the 
acquisition of intellectual ideas; and the arguments in the last 
chapter, which suppose such necessity of phantasms, fall to the ground. 
Averroes supposed one universal intellect of all men, at once potential 
and active: he left the individual, merely as such, nothing higher than 
the sentient powers. Avicenna denied to the individual the active 
intellect, and supposed one universal active intellect for all mankind. 
The potential intellect is reduced by his theory to a momentary 
impressibility.<p> 

Avicenna (Abu Ali Ibn-Sina), a native of Persia, lived A.D. 980-1037. 
Like Averroes, he was physician and philosopher. I quote from <i>The 
Psychology of Ibn-Sina translated by J. M. Macdonald, M.A.</i>, Beyruth 
1884. Four faculties are distinguished by Avicenna all of them 
belonging to the sentient part of the soul: none of them to the 
intelligent part. They are called "conceptual faculty," "imagination," 
"judgement," "memory."<p> 

I. <i>Conceptual faculty</i>. "There is nothing in the conceptual 
faculty besides the true forms derived from sense" (p. 28). This seems 
to correspond to what St Thomas calls <i>virtus apprehensiva 
sensibilis</i>, the faculty of sense perception.<p> 

II. <i>Imagination</i>. "In animals there is a faculty which compounds 
whatever forms have been collected in the common sense, and 
distinguishes between them, and differentiates them, without the 
disappearance of the forms from common sense; and this faculty is named 
imagination" (p. 28). "The imaginative faculty performs its actions 
without perceiving that things are according to its imaginings" (p. 
28). "The imaginative faculty may imagine things other than that which 
the judgement considers desirable" (p. 29). If we might assume that 
this 'imagination' is purely reproductive of sense phantasms, it would 
answer to the 'phantasy' (<i>imaginatio</i>) which St Thomas ascribes 
to Avicenna.<p> 

III. Judgement. "Then in animals there is a faculty 
which decides decisively upon a thing, whether it is this or not. And 
by it the animal flies from that which is to be guarded against, and 
seeks that which is desirable. This faculty is called the 
<i>judging</i> and the <i>supposing</i> faculty" (pp. 28, 29). It is 
not difficult to recognise here that highest faculty of animal nature, 
called in other animals <i>vis aestimativa, in man <i>vis 
cogitativa</i> (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_60.htm">LX</a>).<p> 

IV. Memory. "Then there is in animals a faculty which preserves the 
meaning of that which the faculties have conceived, e.g., that the wolf 
is an enemy." It is a store-house of judgements rather than of sense 
perceptions: for "the senses do not perceive the enmity of the wolf; or 
the love of the child": only the <i>vis aestimativa</i> perceives that, 
"then it treasures them up in this faculty." It is not a store-house of 
fancies, as the "imagination" is: for "this faculty does not picture 
anything which the judgement does not approve. This faculty does not 
declare anything to be true, but preserves what something else declares 
to be true. And this faculty is called the preserving and remembering 
faculty" (p. 29). All this answers exactly to the account of "memory" 
which St Thomas attributes to Avicenna.<p>

We come now to the main argument of this chapter, which is Avicenna's 
belief in the 'active intellect' as a separate intelligence, working 
causatively upon the mind of man, and generating therein universal 
concepts, such concepts not being stored in the human mind for future 
use, but directly created afresh for every recurrence of them, by the 
action of this extrinsic intelligence. Against this doctrine of 
Avicenna, Averroes writes explicitly (<i>De animae beatitudine</i> cap. 
iii, p. 151): <i>Intellectus agens non tantum est causa in intellectu 
materiali</i> [sc. possibili] per viam efficientis et motoris, sed per 
viam ultimae perfectionis, hoc est, per viam formae et finis.</i> (See 
note, p. 135.) Averroes united the active and the potential intellect, 
and made both eternal: Avicenna and Alexander made the active intellect 
alone eternal. Avicenna's theory of the universal active intellect is 
thus given in his own quaint words. -- " The proving of the existence 
of an intellectual essence, distinct from bodies, standing in the 
relation of light to sight, and in the place of a fountain: and the 
proving that, when human souls separate from bodies, they unite with 
this essence" (Title of Section x, p. 40). Speaking of the belief in 
mathematical axioms, he says: "It must be either by the use of sense 
and experiment, or by divine continuous overflow, overflow continuous 
with the rational soul, and the rational soul continuous with it. . . . 
This overflow, which is continuous with the soul, is an intellectual 
essence, not a body, not in a body: it stands by itself, holding the 
relation to the intellectual soul of light to sight" (pp. 40, 41). "The 
soul remains after death ever immortal, joined on to this noble 
essence, which is universal intelligence" (p. 42).<p>

In Avicenna, as in Averroes, one recognises in the doctrine of 
<i>ittis&aacute;l</i> however misdirected, that craving for some 
connexion of man's intelligence with a spirit above his own, which a 
banal materialism or positivism labours to extirpate, making man 
highest of beings and (perforce) self-sufficient. That craving is the 
root of mysticism; and in the doctrine of the Incarnation, with its 
corollaries of grace and sacraments, it has become the animating 
principle of Christianity.<p>
