<H1>The Arguments of those who wish to withdraw from God the 
Knowledge of Individual Things<A HREF="gc1_63a.htm">*</a></H1>

THE first argument is drawn from the very condition of 
individuality. For as matter (<i>materia signata</i>)<A 
HREF="gc1_63b.htm">*</a> is the principle of individuality, it 
seems that individuals cannot be known by any immaterial faculty, 
inasmuch as all knowledge is a certain assimilation, and hence 
even in us those powers alone apprehend individual objects, that 
make use of material organs, as do the imagination and senses, 
but our understanding, which is immaterial, does not recognise 
individuals as such: much less then is the divine understanding 
apt to take cognisance of individuals, being, as it is, the 
furthest removed from matter.<P> 

2. The second argument is that individual things do not always 
exist. Either then they will always be known by God, or they 
will sometimes be known and sometimes not known. The former 
alternative is impossible, because there can be no knowledge of 
that which is not: for knowledge is only of things true, and 
things that are not cannot be true. The second alternative is 
also impossible, because the knowledge of the divine mind is 
absolutely invariable (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_45.htm">XLV</a>).<P> 

3. The third argument is from the consideration that not all 
individual things come of necessity, but some are by contingency: 
hence there can be no certain knowledge of them except when they 
exist. For that knowledge is certain, which is infallible: but 
all knowledge of contingent being is fallible while the thing is 
still in the future; for the opposite may happen of that which is 
held in cognition: for if the opposite could not happen, the 
thing would be a necessity: hence there can be no science in us 
of future contingencies, only a conjectural reckoning.  On the 
other hand we must suppose that all God's knowledge is most 
certain and infallible (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_61.htm">LXI</a>).  It 
is also impossible for God to begin to know anything, by reason 
of His immutability. From this it seems to follow that He does 
not know individual contingencies.<P> 

4. The fourth argument is from this, that some individual effects 
have their cause in will. Now an effect, before it is produced, 
can be known only in its cause: for so only can it have being 
before it begins to have being in itself. But the motions of the 
will can be known with certainty by none other than the willing 
agent, in whose power they are. It is impossible therefore that 
God should have certain knowledge of such individual effects as 
derive their causation from a created will.<P>

5. The fifth argument is from the infinite multitude of 
individual things. The infinite as such is unknown: for all that 
is known is measured in a manner by the comprehension of the 
knower, measurement being nothing else than a marking out and 
ascertaining of the thing measured: hence every art repudiates 
infinities. But individual existences are infinite, at least 
potentially.<P>

6. The sixth argument is from the vileness of individual things. 
As the nobility of knowledge is weighed according to the nobility 
of the thing known, so the vileness also of the thing known seems 
to redound to the vileness of the knowledge.  Therefore the 
excellent nobility of the divine mind does not permit of God 
knowing sundry most vile things that have individual existence. 
<P> 

7. The seventh argument is from the evil that is found in sundry 
individual things.  Since the object known is in some manner in 
the knowing mind, and evil is impossible in God, it seems to 
follow that God can have no knowledge at all of evil and 
privation: only the mind that is in potentiality can know that, 
as privation can be only in potentiality.<A
