<h1>That the Souls of the Wicked after Death have their Will immutably 
fixed on Evil</h1>

THE very disorder of the will is a punishment and a very great 
affliction, because insomuch as a person has a disordered will, 
everything that is done rightly displeases him: thus it will displease 
the damned to see the will of God fulfilled in all things, that will 
which they have sinfully resisted.<p> 

3. The will is changed from sin to goodness only by the grace of God 
(B. III, Chapp. <A HREF="gc3_157.htm">CLVII</a>, <A 
HREF="gc3_158.htm">CLVIII</a>). But as the souls of the good are 
admitted to a perfect participation in the divine goodness, so the 
souls of the damned are totally excluded from grace.<p> 

4. As the good, living in the flesh, make God the ultimate end of all 
their doings and desires, so the wicked set up their rest in some undue 
end which turns them away from God. But the disembodied spirits of the 
good will immovably cling to the end which they have set before 
themselves in this life, namely, God. Therefore the souls of the wicked 
will immovably cling to the end which they too have chosen for 
themselves.<A HREF="gc4_93a.htm">*</a> As then the will of the good 
cannot become evil, so the will of the evil cannot become good.
