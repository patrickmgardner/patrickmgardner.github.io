<H1>That the Worship of Latria is to be paid to God alone</h1>

THERE have been some who have thought that this worship should be paid 
not only to the first principle of all things, but also to all 
creatures that are above men. Hence, while considering God to be the 
one prime and universal principle of all things, they have still 
thought it right to pay <i>latria</i>, first after God, to the 
subsistent intelligences in the heavens, which they also called gods, 
whether they existed entirely apart from bodies or were the souls of 
spheres or stars. Secondly, also to certain subsistent intelligences 
which they believed to be united to bodies of air, and called them 
<i>genii (daimones)</i>: because they believed them to be above men, as 
a body of air is above a body of earth, they insisted that these 
intelligences also were to be worshipped by men with divine worship, 
and in comparison with men they said that they were gods, as being 
intermediate between men and gods. And because they believed that the 
souls of good men, by the fact of their separation from bodies, passed 
to a higher state than the state of the present life, they considered 
that divine worship should be paid also to the souls of the dead, whom 
they called <b>h&ecirc;r&ocirc;es</b>, or <i>manes</i>. Some again, 
taking God to be the soul of the universe, have believed that the 
worship proper to Godhead is to be paid to the whole universe and to 
all its parts, not however for the sake of the material part, but for 
the sake of the soul, which they said was God, as honour is paid to a 
wise man, not for his body but for his mind. Some again used to say 
that even things naturally below man still should be worshipped by man 
with divine honours, inasmuch as some portion of the power of a higher 
nature is communicated to them. Hence, believing that certain images 
made by man were receptive of supernatural power, either from the 
influence of the heavenly bodies or from the presence of Spirits within 
them, they said that such images should receive divine worship, and 
they called those images gods: on which account themselves were called 
'idolaters,' because they paid the worship of <i>latria</i> to idols 
and images.<A HREF="gc3_120a.htm">*</a><p> 

1. But it is irrational in men who posit one only separate first 
principle, to pay divine worship to another. For we pay worship to God, 
not as though He needed it, but to strengthen in ourselves by sensible 
signs a true opinion about God. Now the opinion that God is one, 
exalted above all, cannot be strengthened in us by sensible signs 
except by our paying him some separate and peculiar tribute, which we 
call divine worship. Evidently then true opinion about the one 
principle is weakened, if divine worship is paid to several.<p> 

2. This exterior worship is necessary for man, to the end that man's 
soul may conceive a spiritual reverence for God. But custom goes a long 
way in moving the mind of man: for we are more easily moved to that to 
which we are accustomed. Now the custom among men is that the honour 
that is paid to him who holds the highest place in the commonwealth, as 
to the king or emperor, is paid to none other. Therefore there should 
be a worship that is paid to none other than the one principle of the 
universe; and that we call the worship of <i>latria</i>.<p> 

3. If the worship of <i>latria</i> is due to another merely because he 
is superior, and not because he is supreme, it would follow that one 
man should pay <i>latria</i> to another man, and one angel to another 
angel, seeing that among men, and also among angels, one is superior to 
another. And since among men he who is superior on one point is 
inferior on another, it would follow that men should interchange 
<i>latria</i> in their mutual dealings, which is absurd.<p> 

4. Man ought to pay God something special in recognition of the special 
benefit of his creation; and that is the worship of <i>latria</i>.<p> 

5. <i>Latria</i> means service, and service is due to the master. Now 
he is properly and truly called master, who lays down to others 
precepts of conduct, and himself takes a precept of conduct from none: 
for he who executes the arrangement of a superior is rather minister 
than master. But God's providence disposes all things to their due 
actions: hence in Holy Writ the angels and the heavenly bodies are said 
to minister both to God, whose ordinance they execute, and to us, to 
whose benefit their actions tend. Therefore the worship of 
<i>latria</i>, due to the sovereign master, is to be paid only to the 
sovereign principle of the universe.<p> 

6. Among all acts of <i>latria</i>, a unique rank belongs to sacrifice: 
for genuflections, prostrations and other such marks of honour may be 
paid even to man, although with another intention than they are paid to 
God: but no one ever thought to offer sacrifice except to him whom he 
regarded as God, or affected so to regard. The outward rite of 
sacrifice represents the inward true sacrifice, whereby the human mind 
offers itself to God, as to the principle of its creation, the author 
of its activity, the term of its happiness. Therefore to God alone 
should man offer sacrifice and the worship of <i>latria</i>, and not to 
any created spirits whatsoever.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>He shall be slain who offers sacrifice to any gods 
but to the Lord alone</i> (Exod. xxii, 20): <i>The Lord thy God shalt 
thou adore, and him only shalt thou serve</i> (Deut. vi, 13). And 
because it is an undue thing for the worship of <i>latria</i> to be 
paid to any other than the first principle of all things, and only an 
evil-minded rational creature will incite others to undue acts; 
evidently men have been set on to the aforesaid undue worships by the 
instigation of devils, who have presented themselves to men to be 
adored in place of God, seeking divine honour. Hence it is said: <i>All 
the gods of the heathen are devils</i> (Ps. xcv, 5): <i>The things 
which the heathen sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to 
God</i> (1 Cor. x, 20).
