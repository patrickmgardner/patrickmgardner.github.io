How can mere not-being, as such, be an 
object of the will at all? St Thomas perhaps is speaking
of two existences incompatible with one another.
But it is well to remark, there is a difference 
between not-willing, which is a mere vacuity of will,
and willing-not, which is a positive act of will. The
question may be raised, whether for things possible,
but eternally non existent, any divine decree is 
requisite to keep them out of existence.  Is it not
enough that there is no decree to call them into
existence? Or is such a decree of exclusion rendered
requisite by the conjuntion of a perfect will with a
perfect actual knowledge? Anyhow God is under no
antecedent necessity of decreeing the existence of any
creature, because He is well enough without 
creatures, supremely self-sufficient and independent of
all creation: which independence and self-sufficiency
is the root of the divine free-will <i>ad extra</i>: which
free-will again alone bars pantheism, disconcerts
idealism (by taking away the determinism to which
it leads), saves the notion of a Personal God, and
with it prayer, miracles, Christianity.
