But what was the use of this promise to men
who were never to live to see the salvation of Christ?
Were they to die in their sins? It is commonly 
replied that circumcision, the chief of the Sacraments
of the Old Law, took away original sin, not of itself,
but by virtue of the faith of them that performed it;
whereas baptism is effectual of itself, even when conferred 
by a minister who does not believe in it, providing he confers 
it seriously and without maiming the rite.
