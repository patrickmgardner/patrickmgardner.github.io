Here is implied the Aristotelian doctrine of
habits, according to which a habit may be defined as
'a permanent acquired quality, resident in a power,
and determining that power, originally indeterminate,
to act regularly, readily, and pleasantly in a certain
line of action.' Skill is a habit, so is virtue. The 
argument is that, as there are natural habits, so there
should be a supernatural habit, which is 'habitual'
or 'sanctifying' grace.
