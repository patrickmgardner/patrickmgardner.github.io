By 'matter' St Thomas does not mean material substances 
(<i>corpora</i>), but a sort of matrix, or mother-stuff, conceived as 
not yet determined by any active principle, or 'form,' and therefore in 
potentiality to all manner of material forms. This is called by the 
schoolmen <i>materia prima</i>, or primordial matter. Primordial (or 
formless) matter, as such, nowhere exists: that is to say, all existing 
matter is determined by some particular form, so as to make this or 
that material substance or body: but primordial matter underlies all 
material substances. For a first notion (I do not mean St Thomas's 
notion) of primordial matter, see Plato, <i>Timaeus</i>, 50, 51, 52.
