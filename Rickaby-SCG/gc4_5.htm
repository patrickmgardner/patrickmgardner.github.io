<H1>Rejection of the Opinion of Sabellius concerning the Son of God<A 
HREF="gc4_5a.htm">*</a></h1>

BECAUSE it is a fixed idea in the mind of all who think rightly of God, 
that there can be but one God by nature, some, conceiving from the 
Scriptures the belief that Christ is truly and by nature God and the 
Son of God, have confessed that Christ, the Son of God, and God the 
Father are one God; and yet have not allowed that there was any 'God 
the Son,' so called according to His nature from eternity, but have 
held that God received the denomination of Sonship from the time that 
He was born of the Virgin Mary. Thus all things that Christ suffered in 
the flesh they attributed to God the Father. This was the opinion of 
the Sabellans, who were also called 'Patripassians,' because they 
asserted that the Father had suffered, and that the Father Himself was 
Christ. The peculiarity of this doctrine was the tenet that the term 
'Son of God' does not denote any existing Person, but a property 
supervening upon a pre-existing Person.<p>

The falsity of this position is manifest from Scripture authority. For 
Christ in the Scriptures is not only called the Son of the Virgin, but 
also the Son of God. But it cannot be that the same person should be 
son of himself, or that the same should give existence and receive it. 
We observe also that after the Incarnation the Father gives testimony 
of the Son: <i>This is my beloved Son</i> (Matt. iii, 17): thereby 
pointing to His person. Christ therefore is in person other than His 
Father.<A HREF="gc4_5b.htm">*</a>
