<h1>Of Sex and Age in the Resurrection</h1>

STILL we must not suppose, what some have thought, that female sex has 
no place in the bodies of the risen Saints. For since resurrection 
means the reparation of the defects of nature, nothing of what makes 
for the perfection of nature will be withdrawn from the bodies of the 
risen. Now among other organs that belong to the integrity of the human 
body are those which minister to generation as well in male as in 
female. These organs therefore will rise again in both. Nor is this 
conclusion impaired by the fact that there will be no longer any use of 
these organs (Chap. <A HREF="gc4_83.htm">LXXXIII</a>). If that were any 
ground for their absence from the risen body, all the organs bearing on 
digestion and nutrition should be absent, for there will not be any use 
for them either: thus great part of the organs proper to man would be 
wanting in the risen body. We conclude that all such organs will be 
there, even organs of which the function has ceased: these will not be 
there without a purpose, since they will serve to make up the restored 
integrity of the natural body.<A HREF="gc4_88a.htm">*</a><p> 

Neither is the weakness of the female sex inconsistent with the 
perfection of the resurrection. Such weakness is no departure from 
nature, but is intended by nature.<A HREF="gc4_88b.htm">*</a> This 
natural differentiation will argue the thoroughgoing perfection of 
nature, and commend the divine wisdom that arranges creation in 
diversity of ranks and orders. Nor is there anything to the contrary in 
the expression of the Apostle: <i>Till we all meet and attain to the 
unity of faith and recognition of the Son of God, even to a perfect 
man, to the measure of the full stature of Christ</i> (Eph. iv, 13). 
This does not mean that in that meeting in which the risen shall go 
forth to meet Christ in the air<A HREF="gc4_88c.htm">*</a> every one 
shall be of the male sex, but it indicates the perfection and strength 
of the Church, for the whole Church shalt be like a perfect, full-grown 
man, going out to meet Christ.<A HREF="gc4_88d.htm">*</a><p> 

Again, all must rise at the age of Christ,<A HREF="gc4_88e.htm">*</a> 
which is the age of perfect manhood, for the sake of the perfection of 
nature, which is at its best in this age above others.
