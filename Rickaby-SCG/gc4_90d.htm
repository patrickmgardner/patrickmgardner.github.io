The spirit may be 'constricted,' or tied, to
some material substance, and that material substance
be kept in violent agitation, such that, for every
vibration or other agitation of the substance, there
shall be a corresponding pang of the constricted
spirit. -- I need scarcely add that this notion of
'constriction' is not of faith, but is a theory devised to
explain what is of faith, namely, that <i>everlasting fire
was prepared for the devil and his angels</i> (Matt. xxv, 41),
and somehow torments those spirits.
