<H1>That the Divine Essence, being One, is the proper Likeness 
and Type of all things Intelligible<A HREF="gc1_54a.htm">*</a></h2>

BUT again it may seem to some difficult or impossible that one 
and the same simple being, as the divine essence, should be the 
proper type (<i>propria ratio</i>) and likeness of different 
things.  For as different things are distinguished by means of 
their proper forms, it needs must be that what is like one thing 
according to its proper form should be found unlike to 
another.<P> 

True indeed, different things may have one point of likeness in 
so far as they have one common feature, as man and ass, inasmuch 
as they are animals.  If it were by mere discernment of common 
features that God knew things, it would follow that He had not a 
particular but only a general knowledge of things (contrary to 
Chap. <A HREF="gc1_50.htm">L</a>). To return then to a proper and 
particular knowledge, of which there is here question. The act of 
knowledge is according to the mode in which the likeness of the 
known object is in the knowing mind: for the likeness of the 
known object in the knowing mind is as the form by which that 
mind is set to act. If therefore God has a proper and particular 
knowledge of many different things, He must be the proper and 
particular type of each. We have to enquire how that can be.<A 
HREF="gc1_54b.htm">*</a>

As the Philosopher says, the forms of things, and the definitions 
which mark such forms, are like numbers, in which the addition or 
subtraction of unity varies the species of the number. So in 
definitions: one differentia subtracted or added varies the 
species: thus '<i>sentient substance</i>' varies in species by 
the addition of '<i>irrational</i>' or '<i>rational</i>.' But in 
instances of 'the many in one' the condition of the understanding 
is not as the condition of concrete nature. The nature of a 
concrete being does not admit of the severance of elements, the 
union of which is requisite to the existence of that being: thus 
animal nature will not endure if the soul be removed from the 
body. But the understanding can sometimes take separately 
elements that in actual being are united, when one of them does 
not enter into the concept of the other; thus in 'three' it may 
consider 'two' only, and in 'rational animal' the 'sentient' 
element alone. Hence the understanding may take what is inclusive 
of many elements for a proper specimen of many, by apprehending 
some of them without others. It may take 'ten' as a proper 
specimen of nine by subtraction of one unit, and absolutely as a 
proper specimen of all the numbers included in 'ten.' So also in 
'man' it might recognise a proper type of 'irrational animal' as 
such, and of all the species of 'irrational animal,' unless these 
species involved some positive differentias.<A 
HREF="gc1_54c.htm">*</a> Therefore a certain philosopher, named 
Clement, said that in the scale of beings the nobler are types 
and patterns of the less noble.<A HREF="gc1_54d.htm">*</a> Now 
the divine essence contains in itself the noble qualities of all 
beings, not by way of a compound but by way of a perfect being 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc1_31.htm">XXXI</a>). Every form, as well 
particular as general, is a perfection in so far as it posits 
something; and involves imperfection only in so far as it falls 
short of true being. The divine understanding then can comprehend 
whatever is proper to each in its essence, by understanding 
wherein each thing imitates the divine essence, and wherein it 
falls short of the perfection proper to that essence. Thus, by 
understanding its own essence as imitable in the way of <i>life 
without consciousness</i>, it gathers the proper form of a 
<i>plant</i>, by understanding the same essence as imitable in 
the way of <i>consciousness</i> without <i>intellect</i>, the 
proper form of an animal; and so of the rest. Evidently then the 
divine essence, inasmuch as it is absolutely perfect, may be 
taken as the proper type of each entity; and hence by it God may 
have a particular knowledge of all. But because the proper type 
of one is distinct from the proper type of another -- and 
distinction is the principle of plurality -- there must be 
observable in the divine intellect a distinction and plurality of 
recognised types, in so far as the content of the divine mind is 
the proper type of different things.  And as it is in this way 
that God is cognisant of the special relation of likeness that 
each creature bears to Him, it follows that the types 
(<i>rationes</i>) of things on the divine mind are not several or 
distinct, except in so far as God knows things to be in several 
divers ways capable of assimilation to Himself.<P> 

And from this point of view Augustine says that God has made man 
in one plan and horse on another; and that the plans or types of 
things exist severally in the divine mind (<i>De div. quaest.</i>, 
LXXXIII, 46).  And herein also is defensible in some sort the 
opinion of Plato, who supposes Ideas, according to which all 
beings in the material world are formed.<A
