The greatest minds are simple, -- and deep: little minds may also be 
simple, -- and shallow.  Well thought out, this remark of St Thomas 
will explain the riddle how it comes to pass that, while the highest 
being is simple and one, nevertheless in biological and political 
science differentiation of organs marks the higher animal and the 
more highly developed state.  There is a poverty-stricken 
simplicity: there is a clumsy multiplicity, a sort of boorish 
wealth: there is also an artistic multiplicity, where every detail 
is subordinate to one design.  A <i>cosmos</i> is a matter of unity: 
a <i>chaos</i> is 'a manifold.'  The grandest and highest of beings 
is a formal unity, actually one, virtually many and all.
