St Thomas speaks of a general and ordinary
necessity, e.g., of food for the individual, of the union
of the sexes for the race, not of an accidental necessity, 
or particular emergency. To extend the aphorism 
to the latter case would make it into an assertion
of the end justifying the means, a doctrine read into
the utterances of Catholic authors by persons who in
malice or ignorance misconstrue passages like the
present.
