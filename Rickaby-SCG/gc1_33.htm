<H1>That it is not at all true that the application
of common Predicates to God and to Creatures involves nothing
beyond a mere Identity of Name</h1>

WHERE there is a mere accidental identity of name, there is no order or 
respect implied of one thing to another, but quite by accident one name 
is applied to several different things. But this is not the case with 
the names applied to God and to creatures: for in such a community of 
names we have regard to the order of cause and effect (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_29.htm">XXIX</a>, <A HREF="gc1_32.htm">XXXII</a>).<A 
HREF="gc1_33a.htm">*</a><P> 

2. Moreover, there is some manner of likeness of creatures to God
(Chap. <A HREF="gc1_29.htm">XXIX</a>).<P>

3. When there is no more than a mere identity of name between several
things, we cannot be led from one of them to the knowledge of another;
but from the attributes found in creatures we are led to a knowledge of the
attributes of God (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_30.htm">XXX</a>, <A 
HREF="gc1_31.htm">XXXI</a>).<P>

5. There is no use predicating any name of any thing unless by the name 
we come to understand something about the thing.  But if names are 
predicated of God and creatures by a mere coincidence of sound, we 
understand by those names nothing whatever about God, seeing that the 
significations of those names are known to us only inasmuch as they 
apply to creatures: there would at that rate be no use in saying or 
proving of God that God is a good being, or anything else of the 
sort.<P> 

If it is said that by such names we only know of God what He is not -- 
in that, e.g., He is called 'living' as not being of the genus of 
inanimate things -- at least it must be allowed that the predicate 
'living,' applied to God and to creatures, agrees in the negation of 
the inanimate, and thus will be something more than a bare coincidence 
of name.<A HREF="gc1_33b.htm">*</a>
