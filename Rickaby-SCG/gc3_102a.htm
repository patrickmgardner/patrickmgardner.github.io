By definition, a miracle is a work which transcends 
the powers of nature, where by 'nature' is
understood the physical forces, material and mental,
of which we have ordinary experience in this life.
Beyond the world in which we live there is the
world of spirits, -- of disembodied human souls, of
angels, good and bad, and of God. Whatever any
power of nature does of itself is, by definition, 
excluded from the category of the miraculous. But a
question arises whether, if disembodied spirits or
angels, good or bad, ever effect any sensible change
in this world of matter and sense, such a change
should be called a miracle.  To that question St
Thomas addresses himself in the succeeding chapter.
