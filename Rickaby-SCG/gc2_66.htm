<H1>Against those who suppose Intellect and Sense to be the same</h1>

SENSE is found in all animals, but animals other than man have no 
intellect: which is proved by this, that they do not work, like 
intellectual agents, in diverse and opposite ways, but just as nature 
moves them fixed and uniform specific activities, as every swallow 
builds its nest in the same way.<p>

2. Sense is cognisant only of singulars, but intellect is cognisant of 
universals.<p>

3. Sensory knowledge extends only to bodily things, but intellect takes
cognisance of things incorporeal, as wisdom, truth, and the relations between
objects.<p>

4. No sense has reflex knowledge of itself and its own activity: the 
sight does not see itself, nor see that it sees. But intellect is 
cognisant of itself, and knows that it understands.<A
