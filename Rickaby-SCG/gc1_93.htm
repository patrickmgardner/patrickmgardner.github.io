<H1>That in God there are the Virtues which regulate Action</h1>

THERE are virtues directing the active life of man, which are not
concerned with passions, but with actions, as truth, justice, liberality,
magnificence, prudence, art.  Since virtue is specified by its object,
and the actions which are the objects of these virtues are not inconsistent
with the divine perfection, neither is there in such virtues, specifically 
considered, anything to exclude them from the perfection of God.<p>

3. Of things that come to have being from God, the proper plan of them 
all is in the divine understanding (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_66.htm">LXVI</a>). But the plan of a thing to be made in the 
mind of the maker is Art: hence the Philosopher says that Art is "the 
right notion of things to be made." There is therefore properly Art in 
God, and therefore it is said: <i>Wisdom, artificer of all, taught 
me</i> (Wisd. vii, 21).<p>

4. Again, the divine will, in things outside God, is determined by His 
knowledge (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_82.htm">LXXXII</a>).  But knowledge 
directing the will to act is Prudence: because, according to the 
Philosopher, Prudence is "the right notion of things to be done." There 
is therefore Prudence in God; and hence it is said: <i>With him is 
prudence</i> (Job xii, 13).<p>

5. From the fact of God wishing anything, He wishes the requisites of 
that thing.  But the points requisite to the perfection of each several 
thing are due to that thing: there is therefore in God Justice, the 
function of which is to distribute to each his own.  Hence it is said: 
<i>The Lord is just, and hath loved justice</i> (Ps. x, 8).<p>

6. As shown above (Chapp. <A HREF="gc1_74.htm">LXXIV</a>, <A 
HREF="gc1_75.htm">LXXV</a>), the last end, for the sake of which God 
wills all things, in no way depends on the means to that end, neither 
in point of being nor in point of well-be ing.  Hence God does not wish 
to communicate His goodness for any gain that may accrue to Himself 
thereby, but simply because the mere communication befits Him as the 
fountain of goodness.  But to give, not from any advantage expected 
from the gift, but out of sheer goodness and the fitness of giving, is 
an act of Liberality. God therefore is in the highest degree liberal;<A 
HREF="gc1_93.htm">*</a> and, as Avicenna says, He alone can properly be 
called liberal: for every other agent but Him is in the way of gaining 
something by his action and intends so to gain. This His liberality the 
Scripture declares, saying: <i>As thou openest thy hand, all things 
shall be filled with goodness</i> (Ps. ciii, 28) ; and, <i>Who giveth 
to all abundantly, and reproacheth not</i> (James i, 5).<p> 

7. All things that receive being from God, necessarily bear His 
likeness, in so far as they are, and are good, and have their proper 
archetypes in the divine understanding (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_54.htm">LIV</a>). But this belongs to the virtue of Truth, 
that every one should manifest himself in his deeds and words for such 
as he really is. There is therefore in God the virtue of Truth.<A 
HREF="gc1_93b.htm">*</a> Hence, <i>God is true</i> (Rom. iii, 4); and, 
<i>All thy ways are truth</i> (Ps. cxviii, 151).<p> 

In point of exchange, the proper act of commutative justice, justice does
not befit God, since He receives no advantage from any one; hence, <i>Who
hath first given to him, and recompense shall be made him?</i> (Rom. 
xi, 35;) and,
<i>Who bath given to me beforehand, that I may repay him?</i> (Job xli, 2.) Still, in a
metaphorical sense, we are said to give things to God, inasmuch as He takes
kindly what we have to offer Him. Commutative justice therefore does not
befit God, but only distributive justice.<A HREF="gc1_93c.htm">*</a>
To judge of things to be done, or to give a thing, or make a distribution,
is not proper to man alone, but belongs to any and every intellectual being.  
Inasmuch therefore as the aforesaid actions are considered in their generality,
they have their apt place even in divinity: for as man is the distributer of
human goods, as of money or honour, so is God of all the goods of the 
universe. The aforesaid virtues therefore are of wider extension in God than in
man: for as the justice of man is to a city or family, so is the justice of God
to the entire universe: hence the divine virtues are said to be archetypes of
ours. But other virtues, which do not properly become God, have no 
archetype in the divine nature, but only, as is the case with corporeal things
generally, in the divine wisdom, which contains the proper notions of all
things.<A HREF="gc1_93d.htm">*</a>
