"Under the names of <i>Spirit, Lord</i>, and <i>God</i>, we
have here mentioned the Holy Ghost, the Son, and
the Father, Cf. 2 Cor. xiii. <i>Graces, ministries</i>, and
<i>operations</i>, are all one and the same thing, the extra
ordinary manifestations of divine indwelling which
then followed upon baptism, all the work of one and
the same God" (<i>Notes on St Paul</i> p. 93).
