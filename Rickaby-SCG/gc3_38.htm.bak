<H1>That Human Happiness does not consist
in such Knowledge of God as is common to the majority of
Mankind</h1>

THERE is a certain general and vague knowledge of God in the minds of 
practically, all men, whether it be by the fact of God's existence 
being a self-evident truth, as some think (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_10.htm">X</a>); or, as seems more likely, because natural 
reasoning leads a man promptly to some sort of knowledge of God: for 
men seeing that natural things follow a certain course and order, and 
further considering that order cannot be without an ordainer, they 
perceive generally that there is some ordainer of the things which we 
see. But who or what manner of being the ordainer of nature is, and 
whether He be one or many, cannot be gathered off-hand from this slight 
study. Thus, seeing a man move and do other acts, we perceive that 
there is in him a cause of these activities, which is not in other 
things; and this cause we call the soul; and still we do not yet know 
what the soul is, whether it is anything corporeal or not, or how it 
performs the aforesaid acts. Now such knowledge as this cannot possibly 
suffice for happiness.<p> 

1. For happiness must be an activity without defect. But this knowledge 
is susceptible of admixture of many errors: thus some have believed 
that the ordainer of mundane events is no other than the heavenly 
bodies: hence they have affirmed the heavenly bodies to be gods. Others 
have said the same of the elements, thinking that their natural 
movements and activities come not from any controlling power outside 
them, but that they control other things. Others, believing that human 
acts are not subject to any other than human control, have called those 
men who control other men gods. Such knowledge of God is not sufficient 
for happiness.<p> 

3. No one is blameworthy for not possessing happiness: nay, men who 
have it not, and go on tending to it, are praised. But lack of the 
aforesaid knowledge of God renders a man particularly blameworthy. It 
is a great indication of dulness of perception in a man, when he 
perceives not such manifest signs of God; just as any one would be 
counted lacking in perception, who, seeing a man, did not understand 
that he had a soul. Hence it is said in the Psalms (xiii and lii): 
<i>The fool said in his heart: There is no God. </i><p> 

4. Knowledge of a thing in general, not descending into any details, is 
a very imperfect knowledge, as would be the knowledge of man merely as 
something that moves. By such knowledge a thing is known potentially 
only, for details are potentially contained in generalities. But 
happiness, being a perfect activity and the supreme good of man, must 
turn upon what is actual and not merely potential.
