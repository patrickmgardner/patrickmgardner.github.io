<h1>That the Will of God is His Essence</h1>

GOD has will inasmuch as He has understanding. But He has under-
standing by His essence (Chap. <a href="gc1_44.htm>XLIV</a>, <a 
href="gc1_45.htm">XLV</a>), and therefore will in like manner.<p> 

2. The act of will is the perfection of the agent willing. But the 
divine being is of itself most perfect, and admits of no superadded 
perfection (Chap. <a href="gc1_23.htm">XXIII</a>): therefore in God 
the act of His willing is the act of His being.<p> 

3. As every agent acts inasmuch as it is in actuality, God, being pure 
actuality, must act by His essence. But to will is an act of God: 
therefore God must will by His essence.<p> 

4. If will were anything superadded to the divine substance, that 
substance being complete in being, it would follow that will was 
something adventitious to it as an accident to a subject; also that the 
divine substance stood to the divine will as potentiality to actuality; 
and that there was composition in God: all of which positions have been 
rejected (Chap. <a href="gc1_16.htm">XVI</a>, <a 
href="gc1_18.htm">XVIII</a>, <a href="gc1_23.htm">XXIII</a>).<a
