<H1>That in Spirits there may be Sin, and how</h1>

AS there is an order in active causes, so also in final causes, 
requiring that the secondary end should be subordinate to the primary, 
as the secondary agent depends on the primary. Now every will naturally 
wishes that which is the proper good of the person willing, namely, his 
own perfect well-being; and the will cannot possibly will aught to the 
contrary of this. If we can find a voluntary agent, whose good is a 
final end, such as not to be contained under the order leading to any 
other end, but rather all other ends being contained in the order 
leading up to it, -- in such a voluntary agent there can be no fault of 
the will. Such a voluntary agent is God, whose being is sovereign 
goodness, which is the final end. In God then there can be no fault of 
the will. But in any other voluntary agent, whose proper good must 
necessarily be contained in the order leading to some other good, a sin 
of the will may occur, -- considering the agent as he is in his own 
nature.<A HREF="gc3_109a.htm">*</a> In every voluntary agent there is a 
natural inclination to will and love his own perfect well-being, and 
that to such an extent that he cannot will the contrary. But a created 
agent has no natural endowment of so subordinating his own well-being 
to another end than himself as to be incapable of swerving from that 
end: for the higher end does not belong to the creature's own nature, 
but to a superior nature.<A HREF="gc3_109b.htm">*</a> It is left 
therefore to the decision of his own will to subordinate his proper 
well-being to a higher end. Sin therefore might have found place in the 
will of a pure spirit in this way, -- that he did not refer his own good 
and well-being to the final end, but made that good his end and adhered 
to it accordingly. And because rules of conduct necessarily are taken 
from the end in view, it followed as a matter of course that the said 
spirit arranged his other elections according to that same object (<i>ex 
re ipsa</i>) in which he had placed his last end. Hence his will was not 
regulated by any higher will, a position of independence proper to God 
alone. In this sense we must understand the saying that he aimed at 
equality with God [cf. Isai. xiv, 13], not that he ever expected his 
goodness to equal the divine goodness: such a thought could never have 
occurred to his mind. But to wish to rule others, and not to have one's 
own will ruled by any superior, is to wish to be in power and cease to 
be a subject; and that is the sin of pride. Hence it is aptly said that 
the first sin that a spirit committed was pride. But because once error 
has been committed in regard to a first principle, a varied and 
manifold course of error is bound to ensue, so from the spirit's first 
inordination of will there followed manifold other sin in his will, 
such as hatred of God for withstanding his pride and justly chastising 
his offence, envy against man, and the like.<p> 

Further we may note that when any one's proper good is subordinate to 
several higher powers, it is open to a voluntary agent to withdraw 
himself from his subordination to one superior, and not relinquish his 
subordination to another, be that other the superior or the inferior of 
the first. Thus a soldier, being subordinate at once to the king and to 
the general of the army, may direct his will to the good of the general 
and not to the good of the king, or the other way about. If the general 
withdraws from his allegiance to the king, the will of the soldier, 
withdrawing from the will of the general and directing his affection to 
the king, will be good; and the will of the soldier, following the 
general's will against the will of the king, will be evil. Now not only 
are pure spirits subordinate to God, but also one of them is 
subordinate to another from first to last (B. II, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_95.htm">XCV</a>). And because in any voluntary agent, short 
of God, there may be sin in his will, if we consider him as left to 
his own nature, possibly one of the higher angels, or even the very 
highest of all, committed a sin in his will. And this is probable 
enough, that the sinner was highest of them all: for he would not have 
made his own good estate the final end of his acquiescence, had not his 
goodness been very perfect. Some of the lower angels then of their own 
will may have subordinated their good to [thrown in their lot with] 
that leader, and so have withdrawn their allegiance from God, and 
sinned as he did: while others, observing due regard to God in the 
motion of their will, rightly withdrew from their subordination to the 
sinner, although he was higher than they in the order of nature.<p> 

This is the difference between man and a pure spirit, that in the one 
being of man there are several appetitive faculties, one subordinate to 
another: this is not the case in pure spirits, although one of them is 
under another. But in man, however the inferior appetite may swerve 
from due subordination, any sin that occurs occurs in his will. As then 
it would be a sin in pure spirits for any inferior amongst them to 
swerve from due subordination to a superior, while that superior 
remained in subordination to God; so in the one person of man sin may 
occur in two ways: in one way by the human will not subordinating its 
own good to God, and that sin man has in common with the pure spirit; 
in another way by the good of the lower appetite not being regulated 
according to the higher, as when the pleasures of the flesh, to which 
the concupiscible appetite tends, are willed not in accordance with 
reason; and this sin does not occur in pure spirits.<A
