That is to say, who works unconditionally, being Himself the 
Unconditioned. The "error of the ancient philosophers" was the error of 
Plato (<i>Timaeus</i>, 30), who certainly had arrived to some, though 
an imperfect, knowledge of the Universal Agent. Plato's reluctance to 
confess God as more than the Demiurge, -- or ordering Mind of the 
universe, not its Creator, -- came from his discerning, as he thought, 
the origin of evil in the existence of matter, matter being more or 
less an irrational product, not originated by mind, and but imperfectly 
controlled by mind. Monists at least will not deny the derivation of 
matter from mind. To them, all reality is One and of One: but they deny 
creation out of nothing, and consider matter a necessary and eternal 
outcome of the Divine Mind. On Monism St Thomas touches, Chapp. 
LXXIII-LXXV.
