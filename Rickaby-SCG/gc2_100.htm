<H1>That Intelligences subsisting apart know Individual Things</h1>

INASMUCH as the likenesses representative of things in the mind of a 
separately subsistent intelligence are more universal than in our mind, 
and more effectual means of knowledge, such intelligences are 
instructed by such likenesses of material things not only to the 
knowledge of material things generically or specifically, as would be 
the case with our mind, but also to the knowledge of individual 
existences.<p>

1. The likeness or presentation of a thing in the mind of a separately 
subsistent intelligence is of far-reaching and universal power, so 
that, one as that presentation is and immaterial, it can lead to the 
knowledge of specific principles, and further to the knowledge of 
individualising or material principles. Thereby the intelligence can 
become cognisant, not only of the matter of genus and species, but also 
of that of the individual.<p>

2. What a lower power can do, a higher power can do, but in a more 
excellent way. Hence where the lower power operates through many 
agencies, the higher power operates through one only: for the higher a 
power is, the more it is gathered together and unified, whereas the 
lower is scattered and multiplied. But the human soul, being of lower 
rank than the separately subsistent intelligence, takes cognisance of 
the universal and of the singular by two principles, sense and 
intellect. The higher and self-subsistent intelligence therefore is 
cognisant of both in a higher way by one principle, the intellect.<p>

3. Intelligible impressions of things come to our understanding in the 
opposite order to that in which they come to the understanding of the 
separately subsisting intelligence. To our understanding they come by 
way of analysis (<i>resolutio</i>), that is, by abstraction from 
material and individualising conditions: hence we cannot know 
individual things by aid of such intelligible or universal 
presentations. But to the understanding of the separately subsisting 
intelligence intelligible impressions arrive by way of synthesis 
(<i>compositio</i>). Such an intelligence has its intelligible 
impressions by virtue of its assimilation to the original intelligible 
presentation of the divine understanding, which is not abstracted from 
things but productive of things, -- productive not only of the form, 
but also of the matter, which is the principle of individuation. 
Therefore the impressions in the understanding of a separately 
subsisting intelligence regard the whole object, not only the specific 
but also the individualising principles. The knowledge of singular and 
individual things therefore is not to be withheld from separately 
subsistent intelligences, for all that our intellect cannot take 
cognisance of the singular and individual.<A HREF="gc2_100a.htm">*</a><p>
