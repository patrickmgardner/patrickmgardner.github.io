These chapters, LIX-LXXVIII, are the most abtruse in the whole work. 
They are founded on the scholastic theory of the origin of ideas, which 
again is based on Aristotle, <i>De anima</i>, III, Chapp. IV, V. The 
theory first presupposes the doctrine of matter and form, of which 
there is a fair]y good account in Grote's <i>Aristotle</i>, vol. II, 
pp. 181-196. Grote goes on to expose the Aristotelian doctrine of 
<b>Nous</b> <i>(intellectus)</i>, as he understands it. In this 
exposition two points are noteworthy. (i) No account is taken of St 
Thomas's distinction between potential (<i>possibilis</i>) and 
'passive' (<i>passivus</i>) intellect. (2) A view is ascribed to 
Aristotle, closely allied to the views which Averroes and Avicenna 
ascribe to him, views which St Thomas laboriously combats as being 
neither Aristotelian nor correct. If these Mohammedan commentators, 
with Grote and many moderns, are right, Aristotle cannot be claimed as 
a believer in personal immortality. Still the fact that Plato steadily 
held the individual soul to be immortal, joined to the fact that 
Aristotle, who was forward enough in contradicting his master, nowhere 
explicitly contradicts him on this head, -- as also the obscurity of 
the language of the <i>De anima</i>, -- "may give us pause."<p> 

For any understanding of what follows it is necessary to distinguish 
the 'passive intellect' (<i>intellectus passivus</i>,  <b>nous 
path&ecirc;tikos</b>), the 'potential intellect' (<i>intellectus 
possibilis</i>, <b>nous dunatos</b>, or <b>ho dunamei nous</b>), and the 
'active intellect' (<i>intellectus agens</i>, <b>nous 
poi&ecirc;tikos</b>).<p> 

1. 'Passive intellect' is not intellect at all. It is found in the 
higher dumb animals; and is only called 'intellect' by a sort of brevet 
rank, because being the highest power of the sensitive soul, it comes 
closest to intellect and ministers to it most nearly. St Thomas calls 
it in dumb animals <i>vis aestimativa</i>; in man, <i>vis cognativa</i> 
and <i>ratio particularis</i>.  It has no English name, but may be 
defined: 'an instinct whereby the sentient soul directly recognises a 
sensible object as a particular something here and now present.' See 
Father B&ouml;dder's <i>Psychologia</i>, pp. 71-79, who apposite]y 
cites Cardinal Newman's <i>Grammar of Assent</i>, pp. 107 sq. See too 
Silvester Maurus, <i>Commentary on Aristotle, De anima</i>, lib. III, 
cap. iv (ed Lethielleux, Paris, 1886, tom. IV, pp.    94, 95) Aristotle 
tells us of this faculty that it perishes with the body, but that its 
operation is an indispensable preliminary to all human understanding, 
<b>ho de path&ecirc;tikos nous phthartos, kai aneu toutou outhen 
noei</b> (<i>De anima</i> III, v, ult.)<p> 

2. Much more important is the 'potential intellect,' -- <i>intellectus 
possibilis</i>, a term occurring again and again in all the writings of 
the schoolmen, being founded on one word of Aristotle, <i>De anima</i> 
III, iv, 3, <b>med autou einai phusin oudemian all &ecirc; taut&ecirc;n 
hoti dunaton</b> (nor has it any other natural property than this, that 
it is able, capable, potential). It is defined by Maurus (l.c.): "the 
intellect inasmuch as it is capable of being [representatively] made 
all things, by receiving intelligible impressions of all things." An 
'intelligible impression' differs from a 'sensible impression' as the 
universal from the particular, e.g. as the triangle in the mind, which 
stands for any triangle, from the image of this particular triangle 
chalked on the board and taken up by sense and phantasy.<p> 

3. Of equal scholastic importance is the 'active intellect,' 
<i>intellectus agens</i>, defined by Maurus: "The intellect inasmuch as 
it is capable of [representatively] making all things, by impressing on 
the potential intellect intelligible impressions of all things." The 
term <b>nous poi&ecirc;tikos</b> though not actually found, is implied in 
<i>De anima</i>, III, v. The 'active' and 'potential' intellect 
together make up the understanding. The exact extent of the distinction 
between them is matter of some dispute (B&ouml;dder, 
<i>Psychologia</i>, pp. 159-163).<p> 

What ordinary mortals call 'intellect' or 'understanding,' is the 
'potential intellect.' It is called 'potential' because it is open to 
all intellectual impressions, and, prior to experience, is void of all 
impression, and has no predisposition of itself to one impression 
rather than to another. This by the way seems to militate against the 
Kantian doctrine of intellectual 'categories,' or 'forms of mind.' But 
it does not militate against the doctrine of heredity. Heredity works 
in the body, in the domain of the sentient soul: we are here concerned 
with pure intellect.  Of that, Aristotle says it is "impassible [i.e., 
not directly acted on by matter], yet apt to receive the intelligible 
impression, or form; but has no formed impression upon it, before the 
process of understanding is set up." The 'active intellect' on the 
other hand is the act of spontaneous energy, whereby the intellect 
transforms the image, sent up to it by sense and phantasy, from 
particular to universal, making out of it an 'intelligible impression.' 
A further distinction is drawn between the 'intelligible impression' 
(<i>species intelligibilis impressa</i>) thus created and received in 
the mind, and the 'intelligible expression' (<i>species intelligibilis 
expressa</i>), or precise act whereby the mind understands. See 
B&ouml;dder, <i>Psychologia</i>, pp. i 53-i 56. This distinction has 
been already drawn by St Thomas (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_53.htm">LIII</a>).<p>

For further elucidation see Father Maher's <i>Psychology</i>,
pp. 3O4-313, ed. 4, who however speaks of
<i>intellectus patiens vel possibilis</i>, and takes no account
of the intellectus passivus</i> of St Thomas (B. II, Chap.
LX), probably because it simply is not intellect.<p>
