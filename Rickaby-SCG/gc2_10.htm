<H1>In what manner Power is said to be in God</h1> 

Since the divine action is nothing else than the divine power, it is 
manifest that power is not said to be in God as a principle of His 
action (for nothing is the principle of itself), but as a principle of 
the thing made or done: also that when power is said to be in God in 
respect of the things made or done by Him, this is a predication of 
objective fact: but when it is said to be in Him in respect of His own 
action, such predication regards only our way of viewing things, 
inasmuch as our understanding views under two different concepts God's 
power and God's action.<A HREF="gc2_10a.htm">*</a> Hence if there be any 
actions proper to God, that do not pass into anything made or done, but 
are immanent in the agent, in respect of these actions there is not 
said to be power in God except in our way of viewing things, not in 
objective fact. There are such actions, namely, understanding and 
willing. Properly speaking, the power of God does not regard these 
actions, but only effects produced in the world external to Him. 
Intellect and will, then, are in God, not as 'faculties,' or 'powers,' 
but only as actions. It is also clear from the aforesaid that the 
multitude of actions which are attributed to God, as understanding, 
willing, producing creatures, and the like, are not different things, 
since each one of these actions in God is His own being, which is one 
and the same.
