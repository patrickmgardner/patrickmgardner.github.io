<h1>That the Multitude of the Objects of God's Will is not inconsistent 
with the Simplicity of His Substance</h1> 

GOD wills other things inasmuch as He wills His own goodness (Chap. <a 
href="gc1_75.htm">LXXV</a>). Things then come under the will of God 
according as they are included in His goodness. But in His goodness all 
things are one: for they are in Him according to the mode that befits 
Him; material things, immaterially; and things many, in union (Chap. <a 
href="gc1_55.htm">LV</a>, <a href="gc1_58.htm">LVIII</a>). Thus the 
multitude of the objects of the divine will does not multiply the 
divine substance.
