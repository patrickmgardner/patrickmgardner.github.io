<H1>That Marriage ought not to take place between Kindred</h1>

SINCE in marriage there is a union of different persons, those persons 
who ought to reckon themselves as one because of their being of one 
stock, are properly excluded from intermarrying, that they may love one 
another more ardently on the mere ground of their common origin.<A 
HREF="gc3_125a.htm">*</a><p> 

2. Since the intercourse of man and wife carries with it a certain 
natural shame, those persons should be prevented from such intercourse 
who owe one another a mutual reverence on account of the tie of blood. 
And this is the reason touched on in Leviticus xviii.<p> 

3. Excessive indulgence in sexual pleasures makes for the corruption of 
good manners: for such pleasures of all others most absorb the mind and 
hinder the right exercise of reason. But such excessive indulgence 
would ensue, if the intercourse of the sexes were allowed among persons 
who must necessarily dwell under the same roof, where the occasion of 
such intercourse could not be withdrawn.<p> 

5. In human society the widening of friendships is of the first 
importance. That is done by the marriage tie being formed with 
strangers.<A HREF="gc3_125b.htm">*</a><p> 

It is to be observed that as that inclination is 'natural,' which works 
upon objects as they usually occur, so law too is framed for what 
usually happens. Thus it is no derogation from the reasons above 
alleged, that in some particular case the venture may turn out 
otherwise: for the good of the individual ought to be overlooked in 
view of the good of the many, since the good of the multitude is ever 
more divine than the good of the individual.<A 
HREF="gc3_125c.htm">*</a> Lest however any particular complaint might 
remain wholly without remedy, there rests with legislators and others 
on like footing authority to dispense in a general enactment so far as 
is necessary in a particular case. If the law is human, a dispensation 
may be given by men possessed of power like to that which made the law. 
If the law is a divine enactment, a dispensation may be given by divine 
authority, as in the Old Law a dispensatory indulgence seems to have 
been granted for plurality of wives, and for concubines, and divorce.<A
