<H1>That some Men God delivers from Sin, and some He leaves in Sin</h1>

THOUGH the sinner raises an obstacle to grace, and by the exigence of 
the order of things ought not to receive grace, nevertheless, inasmuch 
as God can work setting aside the connatural order of things, as when 
He gives sight to the blind, or raises the dead, He sometimes out of 
the abundance of His goodness forestalls by the assistance of His grace 
even those who raise an obstacle to it, turning them away from evil and 
converting them to good. And as He does not give sight to all the 
blind, nor heal all the sick, that in those whom He heals the work of 
His power may appear, and in the others the order of nature may be 
observed, so He does not forestall by His aid all who hinder grace, to 
their turning away from evil and conversion to good, but some He so 
forestalls, wishing in them His mercy to appear, while in others He 
would have the order of justice made manifest.<A 
HREF="gc3_162a.htm">*</a> Hence the Apostle says: <i>God, though 
willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with 
much longsuffering vessels of wrath, fitted for destruction, that he 
might show forth the riches of his glory upon the vessels of mercy, 
which he hath prepared unto glory</i> (Rom. ix, 22, 23).<p> 

But when, of men who are enthralled in the same sins, God forestalls 
and converts some, and endures, or permits, others to go their way 
according to the order of things, we should not enquire the reason why 
He converts these and not those: for that depends on His sheer will, 
just as from His sheer will it proceeded that, when all things were 
made out of nothing, some things were made in a position of greater 
advantage than others (<i>digniora</i>).<A HREF="gc3_162b.htm">*</a> 
Hence again the apostle says: <i>Hath not the potter power over the 
clay, to make of the same lump one vessel unto honour and another 
unto dishonour?</i> (Rom. ix, 21.) <p> 

Hereby is refuted the error of Origen, who said that the reason why 
some were converted to God, and not others, was to be sought in divers 
works that their souls had done before they were united with their 
bodies, a theory already set aside (B. II, Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc2_44.htm">XLIV</a>, <A HREF="gc2_83.htm">LXXXIII</a>).
