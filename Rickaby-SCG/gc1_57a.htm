St Thomas's words here and in the next argument should be considered by 
any student of J.S. Mill's Logic.  Mill judged the syllogism from 
ready-made specimens, failing to note that the power of syllogism and 
the ability of a syllogiser is displayed, not in the made syllogism, 
but in syllogising. It is such a view as would be that of the 
biologist, who considered only dead plants and animals, and undervalued 
life accordingly.
