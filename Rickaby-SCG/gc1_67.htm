<H1>That God knows Individual Contingent Events<A 
HREF="gc1_67a.htm">*</a></h1>

HENCE we may gather some inkling of how God has had an infallible 
knowledge of all contingent events from eternity, and yet they cease 
not to be contingent. For contingency is not inconsistent with certain 
and assured knowledge except so far as the contingent event lies in the 
future, not as it is present. While the event is in the future, it may 
not be; and thus the view of him who reckons that it still be may be 
mistaken: but once it is present, for that time it cannot but be. Any 
view therefore formed upon a contingent event inasmuch as it is present 
may be a certitude. But the intuition of the divine mind rests from 
eternity upon each and every [one] of the events that happen in the 
course of time, viewing each as a thing present. There is nothing 
therefore to hinder God from having from eternity an infallible 
knowledge of contingent events.<P> 

2. A contingent event differs from a necessary event in point of the 
way in which each is contained in its cause. A contingent event is so 
contained in its cause as that it either may not or may ensue 
therefrom:<A HREF="gc1_67b.htm">*</a> whereas a necessary event cannot 
but ensue from its cause. But as each of these events is in itself, the 
two do not differ in point of reality; and upon reality truth is 
founded. In a contingent event, considered as it is in itself, there is 
no question of being or not being, but only of being: although, looking 
to the future, a contingent event possibly may not come off. But the 
divine mind knows things from eternity, not only in the being which 
they have in their causes, but also in the being which they have in 
themselves.<P> 

3. As from a necessary cause the effect follows with certainty, with 
like certainty does it follow from a contingent cause, when the cause 
is complete, provided no hindrance be placed.  But as God knows all 
things (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_50.htm">L</a>). He knows not only the causes 
of contingent events, but like-wise the means whereby they may be 
hindered from coming off. He knows therefore with certitude whether 
they are going to come off or not.<A HREF="gc1_67c.htm">*</a><P>

6. The knowledge of God would not be true and perfect, if things did 
not happen in the way that God apprehends them to happen.  But God, 
cognisant as He is of all being of which He is the principle, knows 
every event, not only in itself, but also in its dependence on any 
proximate causes on which it happens to depend: but the dependence of 
contingent events upon their proximate causes involves their ensuing 
upon them contingently.<A HREF="gc1_67d.htm">*</a>  God therefore knows 
sundry events to happen, and to happen contingently: thus the certitude 
and truth of divine knowledge does not remove the contingency of 
events.<P> 

7. When it is said, 'God knows, or knew, this coming event,' an 
intervening medium is supposed between the divine knowledge and the 
thing known, to wit, the time to which the utterance points, in respect 
to which that which is said to be known by God is in the future.  But 
really it is not in the future in respect of the divine knowledge, 
which existing in the instant of eternity is present to all things.  In 
respect of such knowledge, if we set aside the time of speaking, it is 
impossible to say that so-and-so is known as non-existent; and the 
question never arises as to whether the thing possibly may never occur.  
As thus known, it should be said to be seen by God as already present 
in its existence.  Under this aspect, the question of the possibility 
of the thing never coming to be can no longer be raised: what already 
is, in respect of that present instant cannot but be.  The fallacy then 
arises from this, that the time at which we speak, when we say 'God 
knows,' co-exists with eternity; or again the last time that is marked 
when we say 'God knew'; and thus a relation of time, past or present, 
to future is attributed to eternity, which attribution does not hold; 
and thus we have <i>fallacia accidentis</i>.<A HREF="gc1_67e.htm">*</a><P> 

8. Since everything is known by God as seen by Him in the present, the 
necessity of that being true which God knows is like the necessity of 
Socrates's sitting from the fact of his being seen seated. This is not 
necessary absolutely, 'by necessity of the consequent,' as the phrase 
is, but conditionally, or 'by necessity of the consequence.' For this 
conditional proposition is necessary: 'He is sitting, if he is seen 
seated.' Change the conditional proposition into a categorical of this 
form: 'What is seen sitting, is necessarily seated': it is clear that 
the proposition is true as a phrase, where its elements are taken 
together (<i>compositam</i>), but false as a fact, when its elements 
are separated (<i>divisam</i>).<A HREF="gc1_67f.htm">*</a> All these 
objections against the divine knowledge of contingent facts are 
<i>fallacia compositionis et divisionis</i>.<P>

That God knows future contingencies is shown also by the authority of 
Holy Scripture: for it is said of Divine Wisdom, <i>It knows signs and 
portents beforehand, and the issues of times and ages</i> (Wisd. viii, 
8): and, <i>There is nothing hidden from his eyes: from age to age he 
regardeth</i> (Ecclus xxxix, 24, 25).
