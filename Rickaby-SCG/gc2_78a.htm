This chapter is a running commentary on <i>De anima</i>, III, v, and 
may be more profitably presented by a description of its contents than 
by a translation.<p>

1. On <b>anagk&ecirc; kai en t&ecirc; psuch&ecirc; huparchein tautas 
tas diaphoras</b> (these differences must also be in the soul), St 
Thomas points out that the differences in question, to wit, the 
potential and the active intellect, are both said to be "in the soul," 
which excludes either of them from being a faculty extrinsic to the 
soul. <p>

2. On <b>en hapas&ecirc; t&ecirc; phusei</b>, which in his translation 
appears as <i>in omni natura</i>, and which he takes to mean, not as 
the Greek means, "in all nature," but in every natural substance," he 
argues that both the <b>hul&ecirc;</b>, or potential intellect, and the 
<b>aition kai poi&ecirc;tikon</b>, or active intellect, must be in 
<i>the natural substance</i> of the soul. <p>

3. Upon the words, used of the active intellect, that it is 
<b>h&ocirc;s hexis tis, hoion to ph&ocirc;s</b> (as a habit, like 
light), he says that as a habit does not exist by itself, so neither 
can, on this showing, the active intellect. He adds that 'habit' here 
does not mean 'habitual knowledge,' as when we speak of 'a habit (i.e., 
habitual knowledge) of first principles,' but a positive endowment, 
actual and formal, as opposed to privation and potentiality.<p>

4. Of the four epithets bestowed on the active intellect, 
<b>ch&ocirc;ristos, amig&ecirc;s, apath&ecirc;s, t&ecirc; ousia 
&ocirc;n energeia</b> (separate, unmingled, impassible, by essence 
being in act), he observes that the first and second have already been 
applied to the potential intellect: see Chap. IV, n. 6, <b>ho de 
ch&ocirc;ristos</b>: IV, 3, <b> amige einai . . . . oude memichthai 
t&ocirc; s&ocirc;mati</b>. The third, he says, has been applied to the 
potential intellect with a distinction (he refers to iv, 5, 6): the 
potential intellect is <i>impassible</i>, as not being acted on by 
matter, having no bodily organ to receive direct impressions from 
material things: but it <i>receives impressions</i> from the active 
intellect. The fourth, he says, has been flatly denied of the potential 
intellect, which is said, iv, 12, to be <b>dunamei p&ocirc;s ta 
no&ecirc;ta all' entelecheia ouden prin an no&ecirc;</b> (potentially 
identified with the intelligible forms, but actually nothing before it 
understands). He concludes that the word <b>ch&ocirc;ristos</b> is only 
applied to the active intellect in the same sense in which it has 
already been referred to the potential intellect, iv, 9, <b>to men gar 
aisth&ecirc;tikon ouk aneu s&ocirc;matos ho de ch&ocirc;ristos</b> (the 
faculty of sense is not without body, but this is separate). He 
identifies <b>ch&ocirc;ristos</b> with <b>aneu s&ocirc;matos</b>, as 
meaning 'operative without bodily organ.' <p> 

5. On <b>to d' auto estin h&ecirc; kat' energeian epist&ecirc;m&ecirc; 
t&ocirc; pragmati</b> (actual knowledge is identical with its object), 
-- which means that, inasmuch as objects of knowledge become present by 
representation in the mind, the mind in knowing anything knows itself, 
-- St Thomas blames Averroes for taking this to be true only of the 
active intellect: he cites iv, 13, <b>to auto esti to nooun kai to 
nooumenon, h&ecirc; gar th&ecirc;oretik&ecirc; epist&ecirc;m&ecirc; kai 
to out&ocirc;s epist&ecirc;ton to auto estin</b> (knower and known are 
identical, for speculative science and its object are one), where he 
says that Aristotle speaks, not of the active, but of the potential 
intellect. In the words <b>h&ecirc; kat' energeian 
epist&ecirc;m&ecirc;</b> <i>(scientia in acta)</i> St Thomas discovers 
a <i>tertium quid</i>, which is neither potential nor active intellect, 
but a combination of the two: he calls it <i>intellectus in actu</i>, 
'the intellect as actually understanding,' the concrete mind at work.<p> 

6. On <b>h&ecirc; de kata dunamin chron&ocirc; protera en t&ocirc; 
heni, hol&ocirc;s oude chron&ocirc;</b> (potential knowledge is prior 
in time to actual knowledge in the individual, but all the world over 
it is not prior even in time), he is misled by his Latin translation, 
<i>qui vero secundum potentiam,</i> as though the Greek had been <b>ho 
de kata dunamin nous</b>.  He takes it for a question of priority in 
time between the potential intellect and the concrete, actually 
thinking mind (<i>intellectus in actu</i>).  The error is not serious.<p> 

7. Coming to <b>ouch hote men noei, hote de ou noei</b> (it does not at 
one time think, and at another time not think), he says that this is 
spoken of the actually thinking mind, to mark it off from the potential 
intellect.  His conclusion is: "The mind comes to be actually thinking 
by being identified with the objects of thought: hence it is not open 
to it at times to think and at times not to think."  This may mean -- 
as undoubtedly it is Aristotle's meaning: 'There must be thinking so 
long as there are things: but there are always things: therefore there 
is always thinking.'  Then the question comes: 'Yes, but whose 
thinking?' -- to which St Thomas gives no answer.  To interpret with 
Silvester Maurus, 'so long as the mind is actually thinking, it thinks 
unceasingly,' is to father no very profound truth upon the Philosopher.<p>

8. Upon <b>ch&ocirc;ristheis de esti monon touth hoper esti</b> (when 
separated, it is only that which it is) St. Thomas is altogether thrown 
out by his Latin, <i>separatum hoc solum quod vere est</i> (that alone 
is separate which truly is), as though <b>ch&ocirc;ristheis</b> 
(<i>separatum</i>) were the predicate.  He takes the meaning to be that 
the actually thinking mind in man, inclusive at once of potential and 
active intellect, is 'separate' in the sense of not operating through a 
bodily organ.  On <b>touto monon athanaton kai aidion</b> (this alone 
is mortal and everlasting), all his comment is "as being independent of 
the body, since it is separate."  On the last sentence, <b>ou 
mn&ecirc;moneuomen de k.t.l.</b>, he makes no comment whatever in this 
place, but see Chap. LXX, arg. 5.<p> 

No one can seriously contend that, working under such disadvantages, St 
Thomas has succeeded in adequately interpreting this, one of the most 
difficult chapters in Aristotle.  I recommend the reader to study it in 
G. Rodier's masterly work, <i>Aristote, Trait&eacute; de 
l'&acirc;me</i>, 2 vols., text, translation, and notes (Leroux, Paris, 
1900).  I offer these few final remarks. <p> 

(a) From <b>aei gar</b> to <b>oude chron&ocirc;</b>, is a parenthesis; 
as Philoponus says, <b>touto en mes&ocirc; erripsen</b>.  The meaning 
is, as St Thomas well indicates, that though in the individual mind 
knowledge is first potential, then actual, yet somewhere in the range 
of being there is an actual knowledge prior to all potential.  This is 
only carrying out the Aristotelian principle that ultimately the actual 
always precedes the potential: <b>esti gar ex enelecheia ontos panta ta 
gignomena</b> (<i>De anima</i>, III, vii, 1), a principle well put 
forward by Rodier, vol. II, p. 490.  What actually thinking mind 
precedes all potentiality of thought, Aristotle does not tell us in 
this chapter. <p> 

(b) The words, <b>all' ouch hote men noei, hote de ou noei</b>, are to 
be taken in close connexion with <b>t&ecirc; ousia &ocirc;n 
energeia</b>, the whole meaning: 'this mind, ever essentially active, 
thinks continually, and not merely at intervals.'  Whether this refers 
to the mind of the race, Aristotle agreeing with Averroes that mankind 
have existed from eternity, or whether it points to some superhuman 
intelligence, is a question which will be debated as long as Aristotle 
continues to be read.<p> 

(c) <b>ch&ocirc;ristheis d' esti monon touth hoper esti</b>, "when 
separated from the body [in death, as Rodier rightly explains], it is 
its proper self, and nothing else," -- pure <b>nous</b>, apart from 
phantasy and sensation and bodily organism; and this pure <b>nous</b> 
is, in some undefined way, "immortal and everlasting."  In <b>esti 
touth hoper esti</b> I think we may further recognise some slight 
influence of a familiar idiom, by which a Greek says that a thing 'is 
what it is,' when he is either unable or reluctant to enter into 
further detail.<p> 

(d) The concluding words mean: 'We have no memory [after death, of the 
transactions of our earthly existence], because though the <b>nous</b> 
is unaffected by death (<b>apathes</b>), yet the passive intellect 
[<b>ho path&ecirc;tikos nous</b>, the cogitative faculty with the 
phantasy, see St Thomas, Chap. <A HREF="gc2_60.htm">LX</a>], is 
perishable [and perishes with the body], and without this there is no 
understanding [of things learnt in life with its concurrence, -- cf. 
<i>De anima</i>, III, viii, 5, <b>hotan the&ocirc;r&ecirc;, 
anagk&ecirc; hama phantasma ti the&ocirc;rein</b>].'  This sense seems 
definitely fixed as the mind of Aristotle by a previous passage, <i>De 
anima</i>, I, iv, 12-15: -- "The <b>nous</b> within us seems to be a 
subsistent being (<b>ousia</b>) and imperishable.  If it could be 
impaired, it would be impaired most in the feebleness of old age: 
whereas, we may say, the case is the same with intellect as with sense: 
for if the old man got a young man's eye, he would see as the young man 
does.  So old age is not an affection of the soul, but an affection of 
what contains the soul, as in drunken bouts and illnesses.  Thus the 
intellectual and speculative faculty decays when something else in the 
man decays, but of itself it is imperishable (<b>apathes</b>).  But the 
exercise of the cogitative faculty (<b>to dianoeisthai</b>), and the 
passions of love and hate, are not functions of <b>nous</b>, but of 
this individual organism that contains <b>nous</b>, as containing it.  
Therefore when this organism perishes in death, the soul neither 
remembers nor loves: for memory and [the passion of] love were not 
affections of the intelligent soul, but of the compound organism 
wherein soul and matter met, which has not perished: but <b>nous</b> 
perhaps is something more divine and imperishable (<b>ho de nous 
is&ocirc;s theioteron ti kai apathes estin</b>).<p>
