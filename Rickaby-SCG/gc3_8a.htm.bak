Mathematical formulae, expressive of absurd and
impossible cases, express also grades and modes of
absurdity, one case being more absurd than another,
or absurd not for the same reason as another.  It is
not simply true, what the objection lays down, that
"privations and negations are not susceptible of more
and less."
