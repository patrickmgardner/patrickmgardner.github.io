<H1>That in Created Subsistent Intelligences there is a  
Difference between Existence and Essence</h1>

THOUGH subsistent intelligences are not corporeal, nor compounded  of 
matter and form, nor existent as material<A HREF="gc2_52a.htm">*</a> 
forms in matter, still  it must not be thought that they come up to the 
simplicity of the being of God: for there is found in them a certain 
composition, inasmuch as existence (<i>esse</i>) and essence (<i>quod 
est</i>) is not in them the same.<A HREF="gc2_52b.htm">*</a><p>

4. Whatsoever reality subsists of and by itself, nothing attaches to 
that reality except what is proper to being as being. For what is said 
of any reality not as such, does not belong to that reality otherwise 
than accidentally by reason of the subject:<A HREF="gc2_52c.htm">*</a> 
hence, considered apart from the subject in a particular case, the 
attribute does not belong to that reality at all. Now to be 'caused by 
another' does not belong to being, as being: otherwise every being 
would be caused by another, which is impossible (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_13.htm">XIII</a>) Therefore that existence which is being of 
itself and by itself, must be uncaused. No caused being therefore is 
its own existence.<p> 

5. The substance of every reality is a being of itself and not through 
another. Hence actual illumination is not of the substance of air, 
because it accrues to it through another. But to every created reality 
existence accrues through another, otherwise it would not be a 
creature. Therefore of no created substance is it true to say that its 
existence is its substance.<A HREF="gc2_52d.htm">*</a><p> 

Hence in Exodus iii, 14, existence is assigned as the proper name of 
God, He who is: because it is proper to God alone that His substance is 
none other than His existence.<p>
