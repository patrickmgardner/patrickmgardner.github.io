A salient thought and favourite principle with St Thomas. It 
comes out remarkably in his speculations on grace. The final end for 
which God made mankind, according to St Thomas and his school, is not 
the salvation of this and that individual soul, taken as isolated 
units: it is a social construction, an organic whole, in which each 
soul and every man has his proper place divinely allotted, -- not of 
course irrespective of the efforts of his will to secure it, -- and 
places vary in quality and honour. But of them all no place is a bad 
place as God designed it. If any man's career ends in final woe, he 
must, by some wilfulness of his own, have traversed and defeated God's 
special and particular purpose on his behalf. The axiom, <i>De minimis 
non curat praetor</i>, does not hold of God's dealings with His 
creatures (B. III, Chap. LXXVI), least of all with His rational 
creatures (B. III, Chap. CXIII). The humblest place that God's special 
providence has prepared for any spirit or human soul created by Him, is 
a good place, good with a twofold goodness, good for the order and 
beauty of the universe, and good in view of the particular end of that 
individual, which is happiness. Only in consequence of a man's own sin 
(B. III, Chap. CLXIII) undoing the special providence that made <i>for 
his peace</i> (Luke xix, 42), does the man fall under another order of 
providence, which still secures the general good, but no longer his 
gain.
