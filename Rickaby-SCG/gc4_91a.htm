Apart from interpretations put on Scripture
texts, such as Jude 6: 1 Pet, iii, 19: the belief in the
deferring of rewards and punishments to the last day
has been based upon a view of disembodied spirits as
'ghosts' that 'squeak and gibber' (Shakespeare,
<i>Julius Caesar</i>: cf. Homer, <i>Odyssey</i>, xxiv, 5-9, where
they are compared to 'bats'), existences altogether
too slight, fleeting, shadowy and dormant, to be the
subjects of any signal reward or punishment. Nor is
this view readily disprovable, except by the positive
teaching of revelation to the contrary, which indeed
is express and clear in the Catholic Church.
