<H1>That nothing is predicated of God and other beings 
synonymously<A HREF="gc1_32a.htm">*</a></h1>

AN effect that does not receive a form specifically like the form 
whereby the agent acts, is incapable of receiving in synonymous 
predication the name taken from that form.<A HREF="gc1_32b.htm">*</a>  
But, of the things whereof God is cause, the forms do not attain to 
the species of the divine efficacy, since they receive piecemeal and in 
particular what is found in God simply and universally.<P> 

3. Everything that is predicated of several things synonymously, is 
either <i>genus species, differentia, accidens,</i> or <i>proprium</i>.  
But nothing is predicated of God as <i>genus</i>, as has been shown (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_25.htm">XXV</a>); and in like manner neither as 
<i>differentia</i>; nor again as <i>species</i>, which is made up of 
<i>genus</i> and <i>differentia</i>; nor can any accident attach to 
Him, as has been shown (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_23.htm">XXIII</a>); and thus 
nothing is predicated of God either as accident or as <i>proprium</i>, 
for <i>proprium</i> is of the class of accidents. The result is that 
nothing is predicated synonymously of God and other beings.<P> 

6. Whatever is predicated of things so as to imply that one thing 
precedes and the other is consequent and dependent on the former, is 
certainly not predicated synonymously.  Now nothing is predicated of 
God and of other beings as though they stood in the same rank, but it 
is implied that one precedes, and the other is consequent and 
dependent.  Of God all predicates are predicated essentially. He is 
called 'being' to denote that He is essence itself; and 'good,' to 
denote that He is goodness itself.  But of other beings predications 
are made to denote participation. Thus Socrates is called 'a man,' not 
that he is humanity itself, but one having humanity.  It is impossible 
therefore for any predicate to be applied synonymously and in the same 
sense to God and other beings.
