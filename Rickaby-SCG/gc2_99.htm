<H1>That Intelligences subsisting apart know Material Things, that 
is to say, the Species of Things Corporeal</h1> 

SINCE the mind of these intelligences is perfect with all natural 
endowments,<A HREF="gc2_99a.htm">*</a> as being wholly actualised, it 
must comprehend its object, which is intelligible being, under all its 
aspects. Now under intelligible being are included the species also of 
things corporeal.<p> 

2. Since the species of things are distinguished like the species of 
numbers,<A HREF="gc2_99b.htm">*</a> whatever is in the lower species 
must be contained somehow in the higher, as the larger number contains 
the smaller. Since then separately subsistent intelligences rank 
higher than corporeal substances, all properties that in a material way 
are in corporeal substances must be in these separately subsistent 
intelligences in an intelligible and spiritual way: for what is in a 
thing is in it according to the mode of the thing in which it is.<A
