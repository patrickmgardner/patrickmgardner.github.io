A 'generating force' was St Thomas's notion
of the forces of chemistry.  The fall of a stone he put
down to <i>removens prohibens</i>, the support being removed,
and the stone left free to gratify its natural appetite
for rest on earth.  The motion of the heavenly bodies
he attributed, not without hesitation, to their being
animated by a soul (Book II, Chap.  LXX).  Had he
followed out the idea, here obscurely expressed, of the
inertia of matter, he might have been led to divine
the force of gravitation.
