<H1>That there are no Passions in God</h1>

PASSION is not in the intellectual appetite, but only in the sensitive. 
But in God there is no sensitive appetite, as there is no sensible 
knowedge.<p> 

2.  Every passion involves some bodily alteration,<a 
href="gc1_89a.htm">*</a> a thing impossible in the incorporeal 
Deity.<p>

3. In every passion the subject is more or less drawn out of his 
essential condition or connatural disposition: which is not possible 
in the unchangeable God.<a href="gc1_89b.htm">*</a><p> 

4. Every passion fixes determinedly on some one object, according to 
the mode and measure of the passion. Passion, like physical nature, 
rushes blindly at some one thing: that is why passion needs repressing 
and regulating by reason. But the divine will is not determined of 
itself to any one object in creation: but proceeds according to the 
order of its wisdom(Chap. <a href="gc1_82.htm">LXXXII</a>).<p>

5. Every passion is the passion of a subject that is in potentiality. 
But God is altogether free from potentiality, being pure actuality.<p>

Thus every passion, generically as such, is removed from God. But 
certain passions are removed from God, not only generically, but also 
specifically. For every passion takes its species from its object: if 
then an object is altogether unbefitting for God, the passion specified 
by that object is removed from God also on specific grounds. Such a 
passion is Sadness and Grief, the object of which is evil already 
attaching to the sufferer.  Hope, again, though it has good for its 
object, is not of good obtained, but to be obtained, a relation to good 
which is unbefitting for God by reason of His so great perfection, to 
which addition is impossible.  Much more does that perfection exclude 
any potentiality in the way of evil. But Fear regards an evil that may 
be imminent. In two ways then Fear, specifically as such, is removed 
from God, both because it supposes a subject that is in potentiality, 
and because it has for its object some evil that may come to be in the 
subject. Regret again, or Repentance, is repugnant to God, as well 
because it is a species of sadness, as also because it involves a 
change of will.<p>

Moreover, without an error of the intellectual faculty, it is 
impossible for good to be mistaken for evil.  And only in respect of 
private advantages is it possible for the loss of one being to be the 
gain of another.  But to the general good nothing is lost by the good 
of any private member; but every private good goes to fill in the 
public good.<a href="gc1_89c.htm">*</a>  But God is the universal good, 
by partaking in whose likeness all other things are called good. No 
other being's evil then can possibly be good for God.  Nor again, 
seeing that God's knowledge makes no mistakes, can He apprehend as evil 
that which is simply good, and no evil to Him. Envy therefore is 
impossible to God, specifically as Envy, not only because it is a 
species of sadness, but also because it is sadness at the good of 
another, and thus takes the good of another as evil to itself.<a 
href="gc1_89d.htm">*</a><p>

It is part of the same procedure to be sad at good and to desire evil. 
Such sadness arises from good being accounted evil: such desire, from 
evil being accounted good. Now Anger is desire of the evil of another 
for vengeance' sake.  Anger then is far from God by reason of its 
species, not only because it is a species of sadness, but also because 
it is a desire of vengeance, conceived for sadness at an injury done 
one.
