<H1>Apparent Arguments to show that the Human Soul does not begin
with the Body, but has been from Eternity, with Replies to the 
same</h1>

<i>Arg. 1</i>. (A.) What will never cease to be, has a power of being 
always. But of that which has a power of being always it is never true 
to say that it is not: for a thing continues in being so far as its 
power of being extends. What therefore will never cease to be, will 
never either begin to be.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. The power of a thing does not extend to the past, but to 
the present or future: hence with regard to past events possibility has 
no place. Therefore from the fact of the soul having a power of being 
always it does not follow that the soul always has been, but that it 
always will be. -- Besides, that to which power extends does not follow 
until the power is presupposed. It cannot therefore be concluded that 
the soul is always except for the time that comes after it has received 
the power.<p> 

<i>Arg. 2</i>. Truth of the intllectual order is imperishable, 
eternal, necessary. Now from the imperishableness of intellectual truth 
the being of the soul is shown to be imperishable. In like manner from 
the eternity of that truth there may be proved the eternity of the 
soul.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. The eternity of understood truth may be regarded in two 
ways, -- in point of the object which is understood, and in point of the 
mind whereby it is understood. From the eternity of understood truth 
in point of the object, there will follow the eternity of the thing, but 
not the eternity of the thinker. From the eternity of understood truth 
in point of the understanding mind, the eternity of that thinking soul 
will follow. But understood truth is eternal, not in the latter but in 
the former way. As we have seen, the intellectual impressions, whereby 
our soul understands truth, come to us fresh from the phantasms through 
the medium of the active intellect. Hence the conclusion is, not that 
our soul is eternal, but that those understood truths are founded upon 
something which is eternal. In fact they are founded upon the First 
Truth, the universal Cause comprehensive of all truth. To this truth 
our soul stands related, not as the recipient subject to the form which 
it receives, but as a thing to its proper end: for truth is the good of 
the understanding and the end thereof. Now we can gather an argument 
of the duration of a thing from its end, as we can argue the beginning 
of a thing from its efficient cause: for what is ordained to an 
everlasting end must be capable of perpetual duration. Hence the 
immortality of the soul may be argued from the eternity of intellectual 
truth, but not the eternity of the soul.<p> 

<i>Arg. 3</i>. That is not perfect, to which many of its principal 
parts are wanting. If therefore there daily begin to be as many human 
souls as there are men born, it is clear that many of its principal 
parts are daily being added to the universe, and consequently that very 
many are still wanting to it. It follows that the universe is 
imperfect, which is impossible.<A HREF="gc2_83a.htm>*</a><p> 

<i>Reply</i>. The perfection of the universe goes by species, not by 
individuals; and human souls do not differ in species, but only in 
number (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_75.htm">LXXV</a>).<p> 

(B.) Some professing the Catholic faith, but imbued with Platonic 
doctrines, have taken a middle course [between Platonists, who held 
that individual souls were from eternity, now united with bodies, now 
released by turns; and Alexander, Averroes, -- and possibly Aristotle 
himself, -- deniers of personal immortality]. These men, seeing that 
according to the Catholic faith nothing is eternal but God, have 
supposed human souls not to be eternal, but to have been created with 
the world, or rather before the visible world, and to be united with 
bodies recurrently as required. Origen was the first professor of the 
Christian faith to take up this position, and he has since had many 
followers. The position seems assailable on these grounds.<p> 

1. The soul is united with the body as the form and actualising 
principle thereof. Now though actuality is naturally prior to 
potentiality, yet, in the same subject, it is posterior to it in 
time:<A HREF="gc2_83b.htm>*</a> for a thing moves from potentiality to 
actuality. Therefore the seed, which is potentially alive, was before 
the soul, which is the actuality of life.<p> 

2. It is natural to every form to be united to its own proper matter: 
otherwise the compound of matter and form would be something unnatural. 
Now that which belongs to a thing according to its nature is assigned 
to it before that which belongs to it against its nature: for what 
belongs to a thing against its nature attaches to it incidentally, but 
what belongs to it according to its nature attaches to it ordinarily; 
and the incidental is always posterior to the ordinary. It belongs to 
the soul therefore to be united to the body before being apart from the 
body.<p> 

3. Every part, separated from its whole, is imperfect. But the soul, 
being the form (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_47.htm">XLVII</a>), is a part of the 
human species. Therefore, existing by itself, apart from the body, it 
is imperfect. But the perfect is before the imperfect in the order of 
natural things.<A HREF="gc2_83c.htm>*</a><p>                             
(C.) If souls were created without bodies, the question arises how they 
came to be united with bodies. It must have been either violently or 
naturally. If violently, the union of the soul with the body is 
unnatural, and man is an unnatural compound of soul and body, which 
cannot be true. But if souls are naturally united with bodies, then 
they were created with a physical tendency (<i>appetitus naturalis</i>) 
to such union. Now a physical tendency works itself out at once, 
unless something comes in the way. Souls then should have been united 
with bodies from the instant of their creation except for some 
intervening obstacle. But any obstacle intervening to arrest a 
physical tendency, or natural craving, does violence to the same. 
Therefore it would have been by violence that souls were for a period 
separated from their bodies, which is an awkward conclusion.<A 
HREF="gc2_83d.htm>*</a><p> 

(D.) But if it be said that both states alike are natural to the soul, 
as well the state of union with the body as the state of separation, 
according to difference of times, this appears to be impossible, -- 
because points of natural variation are accidents to the subject in 
which they occur, as age and youth: if then union with body and 
separation from a body are natural variations to the soul, the union of 
the soul with the body will be an accident; and man, the result of that 
union, will not be an ordinary, regular entity (<i>ens per se</i>), but 
a casual, incidental being (<i>ens per accidens</i>).<p> 

(E.) But if it is said that souls are united with bodies neither 
violently nor naturally, but of their own spontaneous will, that cannot 
be. For none is willing to come to a worse state except under 
deception. But the soul is in a higher state away from the body, 
especially according to the Platonists, who say that by union with the 
body the soul suffers forgetfulness of what it knew before, and is 
hindered from the contemplation of pure truth. At that rate it has no 
willingness to be united with a body except for some deceit practised 
upon it. Threfore, supposing it to have pre-existed before the body, 
it would not be united therewith of its own accord.<p> 

(F.) But if as an alternative it is said that the soul is united with 
the body neither by nature, nor by its own will, but by a divine 
ordinance, this again does not appear a suitable arrangement, on the 
supposition that souls were created before bodies. For God has 
established everything according to the proper mode of its nature: hence 
it is said: <i>God saw all things that he had made, and they were very 
good</i> (Gen. i, 31). If then He created souls apart from bodies, we 
must say that this mode of being is better suited to their nature. But 
it is not proper for an ordinance of divine goodness to reduce things 
to a lower state, but rather to rise them to a higher. At that rate 
the union of soul with body could not be the result of a divine 
ordinance.<p> 

(G.) This consideration moved Origen to suppose that when souls, 
created from the beginning of time, came by divine ordinance to be 
united with bodies, it was for their punishment. He supposed that they 
had sinned before they came into bodies, and that according to the 
amount of their guilt they were united with bodies of various degrees 
of nobility, shut up in them as in prisons. But this supposition 
cannot stand for reasons alleged above (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_44.htm">XLIV</a>).<p>
