<H1>Of the Error of Arius and Apollinaris concerning the Soul of Christ</h1>

ARIUS held that Christ had no soul, but assumed flesh alone, to which 
the Divinity stood in the place of a soul. In this he was followed by 
Apollinaris. Apollinaris however was brought to confess that Christ had 
a sensitive soul; but he averred that the Divinity stood to that 
sensitive soul in place of mind and intellect (S. Aug. <i>de 
haeresibus</i>, 55).<A HREF="gc4_32a.htm">*</a><p> 

1. It is impossible for the Word of God to be the form of a body.<A 
HREF="gc4_32b.htm">*</a><p>

2. Take away what is of the essence of man, and a true man cannot 
remain. But manifestly the soul is the chief constituent of the essence 
of man, being his form. If Christ then had not a soul, He was not true 
man, though the Apostle calls Him such: <i>One mediator between God and 
men, the man Christ Jesus</i> (1 Tim. ii, 5).<p> 

4. What is generated of any living being cannot be called its 
offspring, unless it come forth in the same species. But if Christ had 
no soul, He would not be of the same species with other men: for things 
that differ in 'form' cannot be of the same species. At that rate 
Christ could not be called the Son of Mary, or she His mother: which 
however is asserted in Scripture (Luke i, 43: ii, 33: John xix, 25).<p> 

5. Express mention is made of the soul of Christ, Matt. xxvi, 8: John 
x, 18: xii, 27.<p> 

9. The body stands to the soul as matter to form, and as the instrument 
to the prime agent. But matter must be proportionate to form, and the 
instrument to the prime agent. Therefore according to the diversity of 
souls there must also be a diversity of bodies. And this is apparent 
even to sense: for in different animals we find different arrangements 
of limbs, adapted to different dispositions of souls.<A 
HREF="gc4_32c.htm">*</a> If then in Christ there were not a soul such 
as our soul, neither would He have had limbs like the limbs of man.
