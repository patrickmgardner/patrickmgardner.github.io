<H1>Whether to Separately Subsisting Intelligences all Points of their 
Natural Knowledge are Simultaneously Present</h1>

Not everything is actually understood, of which there is an 
intellectual impression actually in the understanding. For since a 
subsistent intelligence has also a will, and is thereby master of his 
own acts, it is in his power, when he has got an intellectual 
impression, to use it by actually understanding it; or, if he has 
several, to use one of them. Hence also we do not actually consider 
all things whereof we have knowledge. A subsistent intelligence 
therefore, knowing by a plurality of impressions, uses the one 
impression which he wishes, and thereby actually knows at once all 
things which by one impression he does know. For all things make one 
intelligible object inasmuch as they are known by one presentation, -- 
as also our understanding knows many things together, when thy are as 
one by composition or relation with one another. But things that an 
intelligence knows by different impressions, it does not take 
cognisance of together. Thus, for one understanding, there is one 
thing at a time actually understood. There is therefore in the mind of 
a separately subsisting intelligence a certain succession of acts of 
understanding; not however movement, properly so called: since it is 
not a case of actuality succeeding potentiality, but of actuality 
following upon actuality. But the Divine Mind, knowing all things by 
the one medium of its essence, and having its act for its essence, 
understands all things simultaneously: hence in its understanding there 
is incident no succession, but its act of understanding is entire, 
simultaneous, perfect, abiding, world without end. Amen.
