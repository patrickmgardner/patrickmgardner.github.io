<H1>That there is in God Active Power</h1> 

As passive power, or passivity, follows upon being in potentiality, so 
active power follows upon being in actuality; for everything acts by 
being in actuality, and is acted upon by being in potentiality. But it 
belongs to God to be in actuality; and therefore there is suitably 
ascribed to Him active power, but not passive power.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Thou art powerful, O Lord</i> (Ps. lxxxviii, 9); 
and <i>Thy power and thy justice, O God, are even to the highest 
heaven, in the wonders that thou hast made</i> (Ps. lxx, 18, 19).
