<H1>Against those who find fault with Vows</h1>

SOME have taken it for a folly to bind oneself by vow to obey another, 
or to observe any practice: for there is more of virtue in a good act as 
there is more of freedom: hence the praiseworthiness of virtuous acts 
seems to be diminished by their being done under necessity of obedience 
or vow.<p> 

But these cavillers seem to be ignorant of the nature of necessity. For 
there is a twofold necessity: a necessity of constraint, and this 
diminishes the praiseworthiness of virtuous acts, as telling against 
their voluntariness: for that is done under constraint, which is 
contrary to the will. There is again a necessity springing out of 
interior inclination; and this, far from diminishing, increases the 
credit of a virtuous act: for it makes the will tend to the act of 
virtue all the more earnestly. For evidently, the more perfect the habit 
of virtue is, with all the more force does it urge the will to the act 
of virtue and leaves it less chance of swerving. Nay, if it attains to 
the highest pitch of perfection, it induces a sort of necessity of well-
doing, as will appear in the case of the Blessed, who cannot sin (B. IV, 
Chap. XCII); nor yet is there anything thereby lost either to the 
freedom of the wilt or to the goodness of the act. There is another 
necessity derived from the bearing of the means on the end in view, as 
when it is said to be necessary for one to find a ship in order to cross 
the sea. But neither does this necessity diminish the freedom of the 
will or the goodness of the acts: nay rather, for one to act as doing 
something necessary to an end is in itself praiseworthy, and all the 
more praiseworthy the better the end. But it will be seen that the 
necessity of observing what one has vowed to observe, or obeying the 
superior under whom one has placed oneself, is not a necessity of 
constraint: nor again is it a necessity arising out of interior 
inclination, but out of the bearing of means on the end: for it is 
necessary for the votary to do this or that, if the vow is to be 
fulfilled, or the obedience kept. Since then these are praiseworthy 
ends, inasmuch as they are acts whereby a man submits himself to God, 
the aforesaid necessity takes off nothing from the praise of virtue.<p> 

From yet another point of view the fulfilment of a vow, or of a 
superior's commands, for God's sake, is worthy of greater praise or 
reward. For as one act may be an act of two vices, in that the act of 
one vice is directed to the end of another vice, e.g., when one steals 
to commit fornication, in which case the act is specifically one of 
avarice, but intentionally one of lust,<A HREF="gc3_139a.htm">*</a> -- 
so in the same way the act of one virtue may be directed to the act of 
another virtue, as when one gives for charity, in which case the act is 
specifically one of liberality, but finally one of charity: such an act 
is more praiseworthy for the greater virtue of charity than for 
liberality: hence, though the liberality come to fall short, the act 
will be more praiseworthy, inasmuch as it is referred to charity, and 
worthy of greater reward, than if it were done with greater liberality, 
but not in view of charity.<A HREF="gc3_139b.htm">*</a> Let us suppose 
then a man doing some act of virtue, say, fasting, or restraining his 
sexual passion: if he does this without a vow, it will be an act of 
chastity, or abstinence: but if he does it under a vow, it is further 
referable to another virtue, that virtue to which it belongs to vow and 
pay one's vows to God, which is called the virtue of religion, a higher 
virtue than chastity, or abstinence, as putting us in a right relation 
with God. The act of abstinence therefore, or continence, will be more 
praiseworthy inasmuch as it is done under vow, even though the doer of 
it does not take so much delight in his abstinence, or continence: that 
deficiency is made up by his taking delight in a higher virtue, which is 
religion.<p> 

If any one does anything for God, he offers the act to God, such as it 
is: but if he does it under a vow, he offers to God not only the act but 
also the power: thus he clearly has the intention of rendering to God 
some greater service. Therefore his act will be the more virtuous by 
reason of the greater good intended, even though another shows himself 
more fervent in the execution.<p> 

Moreover, the will that goes before a deed, virtually endures throughout 
the whole course of the doing of it; and renders it praiseworthy, even 
when the agent in the execution of his work is not thinking of the 
purpose for which he began: for it is not necessary for him who has 
undertaken a journey for God's sake, to be actually thinking of God at 
every step of the journey. But clearly he who has vowed to do a thing 
has willed it more intensely than another who simply has a purpose of 
doing it; because he has not only willed to do it, but also has willed 
to fortify himself against failing to do it. This original earnestness 
of will renders the fulfilment of the vow, with more or less of 
earnestness, praiseworthy, even when the will is not actually fixed on the 
work, or is fixed on it but languidly. Thus what is done under vow is 
more praiseworthy than what is done without vow, other conditions 
however being equal.<A HREF="gc3_139c.htm">*</a>
