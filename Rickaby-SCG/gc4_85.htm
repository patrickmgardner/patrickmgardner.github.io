<h1>That the Bodies of the Risen shall be otherwise organised than 
before</h1>

THOUGH the bodies of the risen are to be of the same species with our 
present bodies, still they will be otherwise organised (<i>aliam 
dispositionem habebunt</i>); and chiefly in this, that all the bodies of 
the risen, of good men and evil men alike, will be incorruptible. For 
that, three reasons may be assigned. First, in respect of the end of 
the resurrection, which is reward or punishment for the things done in 
the body; and both the one and the other is to be everlasting (B. III, 
Chapp. <A HREF="gc3_62.htm">LXII</a>, <A HREF="gc3_145.htm">CXLV</a>). <p> 

Secondly, in respect of the formal cause of the resurrection, which is 
the soul. Since the recovery of the body is a provision for the 
perfection of the soul, it is fitting that the body be organised in 
such fashion as shall suit the soul (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc4_79.htm">LXXIX</a>. But the soul is incorruptible, therefore 
the body shall be restored to it incorruptible. A third reason may be 
found in the efficient cause of the resurrection. God will restore to 
life bodies already corrupted and fallen to decay: much more will He be 
able, once He has restored life to them, to ensure that life abiding in 
them everlastingly.<p> 

This body, now corruptible, will be rendered incorruptible in such sort 
that the soul shall have perfect control over it, giving it life.<A 
HREF="gc4_85a.htm">*</a>  Nor shall any foreign power be able to hinder 
this communication of life.<A HREF="gc4_85b.htm">*</a> Risen man then 
shall be immortal, not by taking up another body, that shall be 
incorruptible, but by his present corruptible body being made 
incorruptible. This corruptible mast put on incorruption (1 Cor. xv, 5 
3). So then that saying, <i>Flesh and blood shall not possess the 
kingdom of God</i> (1 Cor. xv, 50), means that in the risen state the 
corruption of flesh and blood shall be taken away, while the substance 
of flesh and blood remains.<A HREF="gc4_85c.htm">*</a>
