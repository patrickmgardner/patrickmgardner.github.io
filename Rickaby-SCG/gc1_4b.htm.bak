It is true, absolutely speaking, that, without
revelation, mankind might take their theology on
trust from philosophers, relying for their spirituality
upon philosophic experts, as upon legal experts for
the maintenance of their proprietary rights. But
then we should expect of the Providence of God a
greater concord of religious views among 
philosophers than at present obtains. Philosophy, were she
our sole guide, should not be permitted to say and
unsay.
