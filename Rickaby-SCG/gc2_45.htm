<H1>The Real Prime Cause of the Variety of Creatures.</h1>

SINCE every agent intends to induce its own likeness in the effect, so  
far as the effect can receive it, an agent will do this more perfectly 
the more perfect itself is. But God is the most perfect of agents: 
therefore it will belong to Him to induce His likeness in creation most 
perfectly, so far as befits created nature.<A HREF="gc2_45a.htm">*</a> 
But creatures cannot attain to any perfect likeness of God so long as 
they are confined to one species of creature; because, since the cause 
exceeds the effect, what is in the cause simply and as one thing is 
found in the effect in a composite and manifold way, unless the effect 
be of the same species as the cause; which is impossible in the case 
before us, for no creature can be equal to God.  Multiplicity therefore 
and variety was needful in creation, to the end that the perfect 
likeness of God might be found in creatures according to their 
measure.<p>

2. As the things that are made of any material are contained in the 
potentiality of the material, so the things done by any agent must be 
in the active power of the agent. But the potentiality of the material 
would not be perfectly reduced to actuality, if out of the material 
were made only one of those things to which the material is in 
potentiality.<A HREF="gc2_45b.htm">*</a> Therefore if any agent whose 
power extends to various effects were to produce only one of those 
effects, his power would not be so completely reduced to actuality as 
by making many. But by the reduction of active power to actuality the 
effect attains to the likeness of the agent. Therefore the likeness of 
God would not be perfect in the universe, if there was only one grade 
of all beings.<A HREF="gc2_45c.htm">*</a><p>

3. A creature approaches more perfectly to the likeness of God by being 
not only good itself, but able to act for the good of others. But no 
creature could do anything for the good of another creature, unless 
there were plurality and inequality among creatures, because the agent 
must be other than the patient and in a position of advantage 
(<i>honorabilius</i>) over it.<A HREF="gc2_45d.htm">*</a><p>

5. The goodness of the species transcends the goodness of the 
individual.<A HREF="gc2_45e.htm">*</a> Therefore the multiplication of 
species is a greater addition to the good of the universe than the 
multiplication of individuals of one species.<p>

7. To a work contrived by sovereign goodness there ought not to be 
lacking the height of perfection proper to it. But the good of order in 
variety is better than the isolated good of any one of the things that 
enter into the order: therefore the good of order ought not to be 
wanting to the work of God; which good could not be, if there were no 
diversity and inequality of creatures. There is then diversity and 
inequality between creatures, not by chance, not from diversity of 
elements, not by the intervention of any (inferior) cause, or 
consideration of merit, but by the special intention of God, wishing to 
give the creature such perfection as it was capable of having.  Hence 
it is said, <i>God saw all things that he had made, and they were very 
good</i> (Gen. i, 31); and this after He had said of them singly, that 
they were good; because while things are good singly in their several 
natures, all taken together they are very good, because of the order of 
the universe, which is the final and noblest perfection of creation.<p>
