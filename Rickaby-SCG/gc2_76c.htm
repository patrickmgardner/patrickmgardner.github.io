One may recognise the hand of Averroes in this rejoinder. For the 
cogitative faculty see Chap. <A HREF="gc2_60.htm">LX</a>. The rest of 
this chapter (cf. note, p. 99) is rather rambling and confused, giving 
the impression of a composition corrected and supplemented and pieced 
together, and never finally revised as a whole. We miss the trim 
neatness and dainty order of the <i>Summa Theologica</i>. I have 
therefore preserved only essentials, and omitted what seemed less 
relevant.
