<H1>That in God the Understanding is His very Essence</h1>

TO understand is an act of an intelligent being, existing in that 
being, not passing out to anything external, as the act of warming 
passes out to the object warmed:<A HREF="gc1_45a.htm">*</a> for an 
intelligible object suffers nothing from being understood, but the 
intelligence that understands it is perfected thereby. But whatever is 
in God is the divine essence. Therefore the act of understanding in God 
is the divine essence.<P> 

5. Every substance is for the sake of its activity. If therefore the 
activity of God is anything else than the divine substance, His end 
will be something different from Himself; and thus God will not be His 
own goodness, seeing that the good of every being is its end.<P> 

From the act of understanding in God being identical with His being, it 
follows necessarily that the act of His understanding is absolutely 
eternal and invariable, exists in actuality only, and has all the other 
attributes that have been proved of the divine being.  God then is not 
potentially intelligent, nor does He begin anew to understand anything, 
nor does He undergo any change or composition in the process of 
understanding.
