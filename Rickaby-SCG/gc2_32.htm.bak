<H1>Reasons alleged for the Eternity of the World on the part of 
God, with Answers to the same</h1> 

<i>Arg. 1.</i> Every agent that is not always in action, suffers some 
change when it comes to act. But God suffers no change, but is ever in 
act in the same way; and from His action created things come to be: 
therefore they always have been.<p>  

<i>Reply</i> (Chap. XXXV). There is no need of God suffering any change 
for fresh effects of His power coming to be. Novelty of effect can only 
indicate change in the agent in so far as it shows novelty of action. 
Any new action in the agent implies some change in the same, at least a 
change from rest to activity. But a fresh effect of God's power does not 
indicate any new action in God, since His action is His essence (B. I, 
Chap. <A HREF="gc1_45.htm">XLV</a>).<p>

<i>Arg. 2.</i> The action of God is eternal: therefore the things 
created by God have been from eternity.<p>  

<i>Reply.</i> That does not follow. For, as shown above (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_23.htm">XXIII</a>), though God acts voluntarily in creation, 
yet it does not follow that there need be any action on His part 
intermediate between the act of His will and the effect of the same, as 
in us the action of our motor activities is so intermediate. With God 
to understand and will is to produce; and the effect produced follows 
upon the understanding and will according to the determination of the 
understanding and the command of the will. But as by the understanding 
there is determined the production of the thing, and its every other 
condition, so there is also prescribed for it the time at which it is 
to be; just as any art determines not only that a thing be of this or 
that character, but also that it be at this or that time, as the 
physician fixes the time for giving the medicine. Thus, assuming God's 
will to be of itself effectual for the production of an effect, the 
effect would follow fresh from the ancient will, without any fresh 
action coming to be put forth on the part of God.<p>  

<i>Arg. 3.</i> Given a sufficient cause, the effect will ensue: 
otherwise it would be possible, when the cause was posited, for the 
effect either to be or not to be. At that rate, the sequence of effect 
upon cause would be possible and no more. But what is possible requires 
something to reduce it to act: we should have therefore to suppose a 
cause whereby the effect was reduced to act, and thus the first cause 
would not be sufficient. But God is the sufficient cause of the 
production of creatures: otherwise He must be in potentiality, and 
become a cause by some addition, which is clearly absurd.<p>  

<i>Reply.</i> Though God is the sufficient cause of the production and 
bringing forth of creatures into being, yet the effect of His 
production need not be taken to be eternal. For, given a sufficient 
cause, there follows its effect, but not an effect alien from the 
cause. Now the proper effect of the will is that that should be which 
the will wants. If it were anything else than what the will wanted, not 
the proper effect of the cause would be secured, but a foreign effect. 
Now as the will wishes that <i>this</i> should be of <i>this</i> or 
<i>that</i> nature, so it also wishes that it should be at <i>this</i> 
or <i>that</i> time. Hence, for will to be a sufficient cause, it is 
requisite that the effect should be when the will wishes it to be. The 
case is otherwise with physical agencies: they cannot wait: physical 
action takes place according as nature is ready for it: there the 
effect must follow at once upon the complete being of the cause.<A 
HREF="gc2_32a.htm">*</a>  But the will does not act according to the 
mode of its being, but according to the mode of its purpose; and 
therefore, as the effect of a physical agent follows the being of the 
agent, if it is sufficient, so the effect of a voluntary agent follows 
the mode of purpose.<p>  

<i>Arg. 4.</i> A voluntary agent does not delay the execution of his 
purpose except in expectation of some future condition not yet 
realised. And this unfulfilled futurity is sometimes in the agent 
himself, as when maturity of active power or the removal of some 
hindrance is the condition expected: sometimes it is without the agent, 
as when there is expected the presence of some one before whom the 
action is to take place, or the arrival of some opportune time that is 
not yet come. A complete volition is at once carried into effect by the 
executive power, except for some defect in that power. Thus at the 
command of the will a limb is at once moved, unless there be some 
break-down in the motor apparatus. Therefore, when any one wishes to do 
a thing and it is not at once done, that must be either for some defect 
of power, the removal of which has to be waited for, or because of the 
incompleteness of the volition to do the thing. I call it 'completeness 
of volition,' when there is a will absolutely to do the thing, anyhow. 
The volition I say is 'incomplete,' when there is no will absolutely to 
do the thing, but the will is conditioned on the existence of some 
circumstance not yet present, or the withdrawal of some present 
impediment. But certainly, whatever God now wills to be, He has from 
eternity willed to be. No new motion of the will can come upon Him: no 
defect or impediment can have clogged His power: there can have been 
nothing outside Himself for Him to wait for in the production of the 
universe, since there is nothing else uncreated save Him alone (Chapp. 
<A HREF="gc2_6.htm">VI</a>, <A HREF="gc2_15.htm">XV</a>).<A 
HREF="gc2_32b.htm">*</a> It seems therefore necessary that God must 
have brought the creature into being from all eternity.<p>  

<i>Reply.</i> The object of the divine will is not the mere being of 
the creature, but its being at a certain time. What is thus willed, 
namely, the being of the creature at that time, is not delayed: because 
the creature began to exist then exactly when God from eternity 
arranged that it should begin to exist.<A HREF="gc2_32c.htm">*</a><p>

<i>Arg. 5.</i> An intellectual agent does not prefer one alternative to 
another except for some superiority of the one over the other. But 
where there is no difference, there can be no superiority. But between 
one non-existence and another non-existence there can be no difference, 
nor is one non-existence preferable to another.<A 
HREF="gc2_32d.htm">*</a> But, looking beyond the entire universe, we 
find <i>nothing</i> but the <i>eternity</i> of God. Now in 
<i>nothing</i> there can be assigned no difference of instants, that a 
thing should be done in one instant rather than in another. In like 
manner neither in <i>eternity</i>, which is all uniform and simple (B. 
I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_15.htm">XV</a>), can there be any difference of 
instants. It follows that the will of God holds itself in one unvarying 
attitude to the production of creatures throughout the whole of 
eternity. Either therefore His will is that creation never be realised 
at all under His eternity, or that it always be realised.<p>  

<i>Reply.</i> It is impossible to mark any difference of parts of any 
duration antecedent to the beginning of all creation, as the fifth 
objection supposed that we could do.<A HREF="gc2_32e.htm">*</a>  For 
nothingness has neither measure nor duration, and the eternity of God 
has no parts, no <i>before</i> and no <i>after</i>. We cannot therefore 
refer the beginning of all creation to any severally marked points in 
any pre-existing measure.<A HREF="gc2_32f.htm">*</a> There are no such 
points for the beginning of creation to be referred to according to any 
relation of agreement or divergence. Hence it is impossible to demand 
any reason in the mind of the agent why he should have brought the 
creature into being in <i>this</i> particular marked instant of 
duration rather than in that other instant preceding or following. God 
brought into being creation and time simultaneously.<A 
HREF="gc2_32g.htm">*</a> There is no account to be taken therefore why 
He produced the creature <i>now</i>, and not before, but only why the 
creature has not always been. There is an analogy in the case of 
<i>place</i>: for particular bodies are produced in a particular time 
and also in a particular place; and, because they have about them a 
time and a place within which they are contained, there must be a 
reason assignable why they are produced in <i>this</i> place and 
<i>this</i> time rather than in any other: but in regard of the whole 
stellar universe (<i>coelum</i>), beyond which there is no 
<i>place</i>, and along with which the universal place of all things is 
produced, no account is to be taken why it is situated <i>here</i> and 
not <i>there</i>. In like manner in the production of the whole 
creation, beyond which there is no time, and simultaneously with which 
time is produced, no question is to be raised why it is <i>now</i> and 
not <i>before</i>, but only why it has not always been, or why it has 
come to be after not being, or why it had any beginning.<p>  

<i>Arg. 6.</i> Means to the end have their necessity from the end, 
especially in voluntary actions.<A HREF="gc2_32h.htm">*</a> So long 
then as the end is uniform, the means to the end must be uniform or 
uniformly produced, unless they come to stand in some new relation to 
the end. Now the end of creatures proceeding from the divine will is 
the divine goodness, which alone can be the end in view of the divine 
will. Since then the divine goodness is uniform for all eternity, alike 
in itself and in comparison with the divine will, it seems that 
creatures must be uniformly brought into being by the divine will for 
all eternity. It cannot be said that any new relation to the end 
supervenes upon them, so long as the position is clung to that they had 
no being at all before a certain fixed time, at which they are supposed 
to have begun to be.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i> Though the end of the divine will can be none other than the 
divine goodness, still the divine will has not to work to bring this 
goodness into being, in the way that the artist works to set up the 
product of his art, since the divine goodness is eternal and 
unchangeable and incapable of addition. Nor does God work for His 
goodness as for an end to be won for Himself, as a king works to win a 
city: for God is His own goodness. He works for this end, only inasmuch 
as He produces an effect which is to share in the end. In such a 
production of things for an end, the uniform attitude of end to agent 
is not to be considered reason enough for an everlasting work. Rather 
we should consider the bearing of the end on the effect produced to 
serve it. The one evinced necessity is that of the production of the 
effect in the manner better calculated to serve the end for which it is 
produced.<A HREF="gc2_32i.htm">*</a><p>

<i>Arg. 7.</i> Since all things, so far as they have being, share in 
the goodness of God; the longer they exist, the more they share of that 
goodness: hence also the perpetual being of the species is said to be 
divine.<A HREF="gc2_32j.htm">*</a> But the divine goodness is 
infinite. Therefore it is proper to it to communicate itself 
infinitely, and not for a fixed time only.<p> 

<i>Reply.</i> It was proper for the creature, in such likeness as became it, 
to represent the divine goodness. Such representation cannot be by way 
of equality: it can only be in such way as the higher and greater is 
represented by the lower and less. Now the excess of the divine 
goodness above the creature is best expressed by this, that creatures 
have not always been in existence: for thereby it appears that all 
other beings but God Himself have God for the author of their being; 
and that His power is not tied to producing effects of one particular 
character, as physical nature produces physical effects, but that He is 
a voluntary and intelligent agent.<p>
