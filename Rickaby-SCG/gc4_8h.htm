Without denial of the fulness of knowledge in
the divine nature of Christ, there is a well-known
current speculation as to how far His human nature
participated in His divine knowledge, and whether
any shade of ignorance was permitted to rest upon 
His human soul, as part of the self-imposed <i>kenosis</i>
mentioned in Phil. ii, 7. This idea of <i>kenosis</i> may be
wrong, but it is not Arianism. There never was
<i>kenosis</i> of the Eternal Son, as such.
