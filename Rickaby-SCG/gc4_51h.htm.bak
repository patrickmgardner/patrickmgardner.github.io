The above is a summary of the scholastic theology of original sin. If I 
mention biblical criticism of the historic value of the early chapters 
of Genesis; evolutionist views of the gradual development of man from 
bestial ancestors; the observations of the anthropologist on what he 
calls 'primitive man,' a being far removed from 'original justice,' and 
only innocent inasmuch as he <i>lived without law</i> (Rom. vii, 9); I 
do so by way of recognition of the many sciences that now claim the 
attention of the ecclesiastical student over and above scholastic 
theology. The leisurely hours of the seventeenth century were occupied 
with discussions as to the number of days that Adam spent in Paradise, 
and whether original justice consists of one 'form ' or many. That 
leisure is gone: <b>schol&ecirc;</b> (whence <i>scholastic</i>) has 
passed into <b>ascholia</b>. Still, to be deep, one must specialise; 
and one field of specialisation is scholastic theology. Only let the 
modern scholastic specialist never take his eyes off the thought of the 
century in which he lives. St Thomas is brimful of the speculations 
that were rife in his own University of Paris. So is Suarez replete 
with the best contemporary thought of Spain, and was not neglectful 
even of England. A great theologian is never behind the times.<p>
