This statement, along with the previous (n. 4),
is St Thomas's repudiation of ultra-realism, a doctrine
with which the schoolmen are often charged, as
though they gave the objects of universal concepts,
as universal, a place <i>in rerum natura</i>. The 
neo-Kantian school, identifying reality with thought, may be
more open to the accusation. Is not the old 
mediaeval strife about 'universals' still being waged under
other names?<P>

Modern scholars make a great difficulty of 
admitting that the "common element" in a number
of similar objects, e.g., of dogs, can be thought of
without addition of colour, size, and other points,
which go to individualise this dog. Take all those
points away, they say, and you have nothing left.
Certainly you have no picture in the imagination
left. But cursory, rapid thinking, -- and such is our
usual thinking, -- is done without any picture in the
imagination; we think vaguely, or, as Cardinal 
Newman in the <i>Grammar of Assent</i> calls it, "notionally."
Only in vivid thought is a sensible picture in the
imagination formed, and the apprehension becomes
what Newman calls "real." The object then appears
with its individualising features upon the imaginative
canvas, the mind meanwhile remarking to itself that
this figure, e.g., of this dog, is a specimen or type, to
which other objects will conform with various 
differences.
