The parallel between the subordination of angel
to angel and appetite to appetite is not perfect: for
if the lower angel disobeys, it is the sin of that angel:
but if the lower appetite disobeys, it is no sin, unless 
the disobedience be countenanced by the higher;
and then the sin is primarily in the higher, and only
redundance in the lower appetite.
