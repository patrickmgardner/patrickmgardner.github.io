The prayer of petition would be fruitless, certainly; 
and that is the prayer, the cry of distress,
which bursts most rervently from heart and lips: but
even the chant of praise would die away except for
operatic purposes. Who would 'give thanks' to the
law of gravitation, or 'bless' Maclauren's theorem,
or 'glorify' Boyle's Law, or 'adore' the whole 
concatenation of the laws of thought and things?
