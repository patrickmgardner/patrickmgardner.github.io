<h1>That God of necessity wills His own Being and His own Goodness</h1>

GOD wills His own being and His own goodness as His first object and 
reason for willing all other things (Chap. <a 
href="gc1_74.htm">LXXIV</a>), and this He wills in everything that He 
does will. Nor is it possible for Him to will it merely potentially: He 
must will it actually, as His willing is His being.<p> 

4. All things, in so far as they have existence, are likened to God, 
who is the first and greatest being.  But all things, in so far as 
they have existence, cherish their own being naturally in such manner 
as they can. Much more therefore does God cherish His own being 
naturally.
