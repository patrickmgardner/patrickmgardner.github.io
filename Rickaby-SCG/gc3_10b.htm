This axiom is redolent of the <i>primum mobile</i>.  Taking a more 
modern view of the physical order, we may say that no agent acts to any 
orderly purpose except in concert with other agents, with which it is 
bound up in the unity of one system.  Modern science tells not so much 
of subordination as of co-ordination, -- of a polity, but not of a 
monarchy among material forces.
