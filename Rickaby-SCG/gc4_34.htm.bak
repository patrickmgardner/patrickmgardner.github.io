<H1>Of the Error of Theodore of Mopsuestia concerning the Union of the Word 
with Man</h1>

BY the foregoing chapters it appears that neither was the divine nature 
wanting to Christ, as Photinus said; nor a true human body, according 
to the error of the Manicheans; nor again a human soul, as Arius and 
Apollinaris supposed. These three substances then meet in Christ, the 
Divinity, a human soul, and a true human body. It remains to enquire, 
according to the evidence of Scripture, what is to be thought of the 
union of the three. Theodore of Mopsuestia, then, and Nestorius, his 
follower, brought out the following theory of this union.<A 
HREF="gc4_34a.htm">*</a><p> 

They said that a human soul and a human body were naturally united in 
Christ to constitute one man of the same species and nature with other 
men; and that in this man God dwelt as in His temple by grace, as He 
does in other holy men. Hence He said Himself: <i>Dissolve this temple, 
and in three days I will raise it up</i>: which the Evangelist 
explains: <i>He spoke of the temple of his body</i> (John ii, 19). 
Hereupon there followed a union of affections between the Man Christ 
and God, the Man adhering with hearty good will to God, and God 
willingly accepting Him, as He says Himself: <i>He that sent me is with 
me; and he hath not left me alone, because I do always the things that 
are pleasing to him</i> (John viii, 29): giving us to understand that 
the union of that Man with God is as the union of which the Apostle 
speaks: <i>He that adhereth to God, is one spirit</i> (1 Cor. vi, 17). 
And as by this union the names that properly apply to God are 
transferred to men, so that they are called <i>gods</i>, and <i>sons of 
God</i>, and <i>lords</i>, and <i>holy ones</i>, and <i>christs</i>, as 
appears by divers passages of Scripture (e.g., Pss. lxxxi, civ); so are 
divine names duly applied to the Man Christ, and by reason of the 
indwelling of God and the union of affections with Him He is called 
God, and Son of God, and Lord, and Holy One, and Christ. Moreover, 
because in that Man there was greater fulness of grace than in other 
holy men, He was above others the temple of God, and more closely 
united with God in affection, and shared the divine names by a peculiar 
privilege of His own; and for this excellence of grace He was put in 
participation of divine honour and dignity, and has come to be adored 
along with God. And thus one is the person of the Word of God, and 
another the person of that Man who is adored along with God. Or if 
there is said to be one person of them both, that will be by reason of 
the aforesaid union of affections, on the strength of which that Man 
and the Word of God will be one person, in the same way in which it is 
said of husband and wife that <i>they are no more two, but one 
flesh</i> (Matt. xix, 6). And because such a union does not authorise 
us to predicate of the one whatever can be predicated of the other -- 
for not whatever is true of the husband is true of the wife, or vice 
versa, -- therefore in the case of the union of the Word with that Man 
this Nestorian doctrine has it we should not fail to notice how the 
properties of that Man, belonging to His human nature, cannot fitly be 
predicated of the Word of God, or God. Thus it is proper to that Man to 
have been born of a Virgin, to have suffered, died, and been buried: 
all of which things, Nestorians say, are impossible to predicate of 
God, or of the Word of God. But because there are some names which, 
while applying to God in the first place, are communicated to man in a 
sense, as <i>Christ, Lord, Holy One,</i> or even <i>Son of God</i>, 
they see no difficulty in terms expressive of the above incidents of 
humanity being united as predicates with these names. So they think it 
proper to say that 'Christ,' 'the Lord of glory,' 'the Saint of 
saints,' or even 'the Son of God,' was 'born of a virgin,' 'suffered,' 
'died,' and 'was buried.' Therefore they say that the Blessed Virgin 
should not be called 'mother of God,' or 'of the Word of God,' but 
'mother of Christ.'<p> 

1. Any thoughtful person may see that this theory cannot stand with the 
truth of the Incarnation. The theory holds that the Word of God was 
united with the Man Christ only by the indwelling of grace and 
consequent union of wills. But the indwelling of the Word of God in man 
does not mean the Word of God being Incarnate: for the Word of God and 
God Himself dwelt in all the saints from the beginning of the world, 
according to the text: <i>Ye are the temple of the living God, as God 
says: I will dwell in them</i> (2 Cor vi, 16: Levit. xxvi, 12). But this 
indwelling cannot be called an incarnation: otherwise God must have 
become incarnate frequently from the beginning of the world. Nor is it 
enough to constitute an incarnation, if the Word of God and God dwelt 
in the Man Christ with more abundant grace: for greater and less do not 
make a difference of species in point of union.<p>

3. Everything that is made anything is that which it is made, as what 
is made man is man, and what is made white is white. But the Word of 
God has been made man (John i, 14). Therefore the Word of God is man. 
But, of two things differing in person, or <i>suppositum</i>, <A 
HREF="gc4_34b.htm">*</a> the one cannot possibly be predicated of the 
other. When it is said 'Man is an animal,' that self-same being which 
is an animal is man. When it is said, 'Man is white,' some particular 
man himself is pointed at as being white, although whiteness is beyond 
the essential notion of humanity. But in no way can it be said that 
Socrates is Plato, or any other of the individuals either of the same 
or of a different species. If then the Word has been made flesh, that 
is, man, it is impossible for there to be two persons, one of the Word, 
the other of the Man.<p> 

4. No one would say, 'I am running,' when some one else was running, 
except perhaps figuratively, meaning that another was running in his 
place. But <i>that man who is called Jesus</i> (John ix, 11) says of 
Himself, <i>Before Abraham was, I am</i> (John viii, 58); <i>I and the 
Father are one</i> (John x, 30); and sundry other phrases, manifestly 
proper to the divinity of the Word. Therefore the person of that Man 
speaking is the person of the Son of God.<p> 

6. To ascend into heaven is clearly an attribute of Christ as man, who 
<i>in their sight was taken up</i> (Acts i, 9). And to descend from 
heaven is an attribute of the Word of God. But <i>he who descended, the 
same is he that hath ascended</i> (Eph. iv, 10).<p> 

11. Though a man be called 'Lord' by participation in the divine 
dominion, still no man, nor any creature whatever, can be called 'the 
Lord of glory': because the glory of happiness to come is something 
which God alone by nature possesses, others only by the gift of grace: 
hence it is said: <i> The Lord of mighty deeds, he is the king of 
glory</i> (Ps. xxiii, 10). But, <i>had they known, never could they 
have crucified the Lord of glory</i> (i Cor. ii, 8). It is true then to 
say that God was crucified.<p> 

12. Scripture attributes suffering and death to the only-begotten Son 
of God: <i>He spared not his own Son, but gave him up for us all</i> 
(Rom. viii, 32): <i>God so loved the world as to give his only begotten 
Son</i> (John iii, 16: cf. verse 1 and Rom. v, 8).<p> 

17. <i>The word was made flesh</i> (John i, 14). But the Word was not 
flesh except of a woman. The Word then was <i>made of a woman</i> (Gal. 
iv, 4), -- of a Virgin Mother, for a Virgin is the Mother of the Word 
of God.<A HREF="gc4_34c.htm">*</a><p> 

19. Phil. ii, 5-11. If with Nestorius we divide Christ into two -- into 
the Man, who is the Son of God by adoption, and the Son of God by 
nature, who is the Word of God, -- this passage cannot be understood of 
the Man. That Man, if he be mere man, was not, to begin with, <i>in the 
form of God</i> so as afterwards to come to be <i>in the likeness of 
men</i>, but rather the other way about, being man, He became partaker 
of the Deity, in which participation He was not <i>emptied</i>, but 
exalted. It must then be understood of the Word of God, that He was, to 
begin with, from eternity <i>in the form of God</i>, that is, in the 
nature of God, and afterwards <i>emptied</i> himself by being <i>made in 
the likeness of men</i>. That emptying cannot be understood to mean the 
mere in dwelling of the Word of God in the man Christ Jesus. For from 
the beginning of the world the Word of God has dwelt by grace in all 
holy men, yet not for that is it said to be emptied: for God's 
communication of His goodness to creatures is no derogation from 
Himself but rather an exaltation, inasmuch as His pre-eminence appears 
by the goodness of creatures, and all the more the better the creatures 
are. Hence if the Word of God dwelt more fully in the Man Christ than 
in other saints, there was less emptying of the Word in His case than 
in the case of others. Evidently then the union of the Word with human 
nature is not to be understood to mean the mere indwelling of the Word 
of God in that Man, but the Word of God truly being made man. Thus only 
can that emptying be said to take place; the Word of God being said to 
be emptied, that is made small, not by any loss of His own greatness, 
but by the assumption of human littleness.<A HREF="gc4_34d.htm">*</a><p>

24. The man Christ, speaking of Himself, says many divine and 
supernatural things, as, <i>I will raise him up at the last day</i> 
(John vi, 40): <i>I give them life everlasting</i> (John x, 28). Such 
language would be the height of pride, if the speaker were not Himself 
God, but only had God dwelling in him. And still Christ says of 
Himself: <i>Learn of me, because I am meek and humble of heart</i> 
(Matt. xi, 29).<A HREF="gc4_34e.htm">*</a><p> 

26. <i>In him all things were made</i> (Col. i, 16) is said of the Word 
of God; and <i>first-born of the dead</i> (ib. 18) is said of Christ; 
in such context as to show that the Word of God and Christ are one and 
the same person.<p> 

27. The same conclusion appears in 1 Cor. viii, 6: <i>And one Lord 
Jesus Christ, by whom are all things</i>.<p> 

The opinion of Nestorius on the mystery of the Incarnation differs 
little from the opinion of Photinus. Both asserted that the man Christ 
was God only through the indwelling of grace. Photinus said that Christ 
merited the name and glory of Godhead by His passion and good works. 
Nestorius avowed that He had this name and glory from the first instant 
of His conception on account of the full and ample indwelling of God 
in Him. But concerning the eternal generation of the Word they differ 
considerably; Nestorius confessing it, Photinus denying it entirely.<p>
