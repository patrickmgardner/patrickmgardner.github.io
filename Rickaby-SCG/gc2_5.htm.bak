<H1>Order of Matters to be Treated</h1> 

The order of our treatise will be to deal first with the production and 
bringing of things into being (Chapp VI-XXXVIII); secondly with the 
distinction of things (Chapp. XXXIX-XLV); thirdly, with the nature of 
things thus produced and distinct so far as it appertains to the truth 
of faith (Chapp. XLVI-CI).
