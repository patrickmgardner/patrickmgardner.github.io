<H1>That God is One</h1>

THERE cannot possibly be two sovereign goods. But God is the sovereign 
good. Therefore there is but one God.<P>

2. God is all-perfect, wanting in no perfection.  If then there are
several gods, there must be several thus perfect beings.  But that is impossible:
for if to none of them is wanting any perfection, nor is there any admixture
of imperfection in any, there will be nothing to distinguish them one from
another.<P>

7. If there are two beings, each necessarily existent, they must agree 
in point of necessary existence. Therefore they must be distinguished 
by some addition made to one only or to both of them; and thus either 
one or both must be composite. But no composite being exists 
necessarily of itself, as has been shown above (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_18.htm">XVIII</a>).  Therefore there cannot be several 
necessary beings, nor several gods.<P> 

9. If there are two gods, this name 'God' is predicated of each either 
in the same sense or in different senses. If in different senses, that 
does not touch the present question: for there is nothing to prevent 
anything from being called by any name in a sense different from that 
in which the name is ordinarily borne, if common parlance so allows.<A 
HREF="gc1_42a.htm">*</a> But if the predication is in the same sense, 
there must be in both a common nature, logically considered.<A 
HREF="gc1_42b.htm">*</a> Either then this nature has one existence in 
both, or it has two different existences. If it has one existence, they 
will be not two but one being: for there is not one existence of two 
beings that are substantially distinct.  But if the nature has a 
different existence in each possessor, neither of the possessors will 
be his own essence, or his own existence, as is proper to God (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_22.htm">XXII</a>): therefore neither of them is that which we 
understand by the name of God.<A HREF="gc1_42c.htm">*</a><P>

12. If there are many gods, the nature of godhead cannot be numerically 
one in each.  There must be therefore something to distinguish the 
divine nature in this and that god: but that is impossible, since the 
divine nature does not admit of addition or difference, whether in the 
way of points essential or of points accidental (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_23.htm">XXIII</a>, <A HREF="gc1_24.htm">XXIV</a>). <P> 

13. Abstract being is one only: thus whiteness, if there were any 
whiteness in the abstract, would be one only.  But God is abstract 
being itself, seeing that He is His own being (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_22.htm">XXII</a>).<A HREF="gc1_42d.htm">*</a>  Therefore 
there can be only one God.<P> 

This declaration of the divine unity we can also gather from Holy 
Writ. For it is said: <i>Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy God is one 
Lord</i> (Deut. vi, 4) And, <i>One Lord, one faith</i> (Eph. iv, 5).<P> 

By this truth the Gentiles are set aside in their assertion of a 
multitude of gods. Yet it must be allowed that many of them proclaimed 
the existence of one supreme God, by whom all the other beings to whom 
they gave the name of gods had been created.<A HREF="gc1_42e.htm">*</a> 
They awarded the name of godhead to all everlasting substances,<A 
HREF="gc1_42f.htm">*</a> chiefly on the score of their wisdom and 
felicity and their government of the world.  And this fashion of speech 
is found even in Holy Scripture, where the holy angels, or even men 
bearing the office of judges, are called <i>gods: There is none like 
thee among gods, O Lord</i> (Ps. lxxxv, 8); and, <i>I have said, Ye are 
gods</i> (Ps. lxxxi, 6).<A HREF="gc1_42g.htm">*</a>  Hence the Manicheans 
seem to be in greater opposition to this truth in their maintenance of 
two first principles, the one not the cause of the other.<A
