<H1>Of the Certainty of Divine Providence<A HREF="gc3_94a.htm">*</a></h1>

IT will be necessary now to repeat some of the things that have been 
said before, to make it evident that (a) nothing escapes divine 
providence, and the order of divine providence can nowise be changed; 
and yet (b) it does not follow that the events which happen under 
divine providence all happen of necessity. 

(a) Our first point of study is this, that as God is the cause of all 
existing things, conferring being on them all, the order of His 
providence must embrace all things: for He must grant preservation to 
those to whom He has granted existence, and bestow on them perfection 
in the attainment of their last end. In the case of every one who has 
to provide for others there are two things to observe, the 
pre-arranging of the order intended and the setting of the pre-arranged 
order on foot. The former is an exercise of intellectual ability, the 
latter of practical. The difference between the two is this, that in 
the pre-arrangement of order the providence is more perfect, the 
further the arrangement can be extended even to the least details: 
there would be not many parts of prudence in him who was competent only 
to arrange generalities: but in the carrying of the order out into 
effect the providence of the ruler is marked by greater dignity and 
completeness the more general it is, and the more numerous the 
subordinate functionaries through whom he fulfils his design, for the 
very marshalling of those functionaries makes a great part of the 
foreseen arrangement. Divine providence, therefore, being absolutely 
perfect (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_28.htm">XXVIII</a>), arranges all 
things by the eternal forethought of its wisdom, down to the smallest 
details, no matter how trifling they appear. And all agents that do any 
work act as instruments in His hands, and minister in obedience to 
Him, to the unfolding of that order of providence in creation which He 
has from eternity devised. But if all things that act must necessarily 
minister to Him in their action, it is impossible for any agent to 
hinder the execution of divine providence by acting contrary to it. Nor 
is it possible for divine providence to be hindered by the defect of 
any agent or patient, since all active or passive power in creation is 
caused according to the divine arrangement. Again it is impossible for 
the execution of divine providence to be hindered by any change of 
providence, since God is wholly unchangeable (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_15.htm">XV</a>). The conclusion remains, that the divine 
provision cannot be annulled.<p>

(6) Now to our second point of study. Every agent intends good, and 
better so far as it can (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_3.htm">III</a>). But good 
and better do not have place in the same way in a whole and in its 
parts. In the whole the good is the entire effect arising out of the 
order and composition of the parts: hence it is better for the whole 
that there should be inequality among the parts, without which 
inequality the order and perfection of the whole cannot be, than that 
all the parts should be equal, every one of them attaining to the rank 
of the noblest part. And yet, considered by itself, every part of lower 
rank would be better if it were in the rank of some superior part. Thus 
in the human body the foot would be a more dignified part of man if it 
had the beauty and power of the eye; but the whole body would be worse 
off for lacking the office of the foot. The scope and aim therefore of 
the particular agent is not the same as that of the universal agent. 
The particular agent tends to the good of the part absolutely, and 
makes the best of it that it can; but the universal agent tends to the 
good of the whole: hence a defect may be beside the intention of the 
particular agent, but according to the intention of the universal 
agent. It is the intention of the particular agent that its effect 
should be perfect to the utmost possible in its kind: but it is the 
intention of the universal agent that this effect be carried to a 
certain degree of perfection and no further. Now between the parts of 
the universe the first apparent difference is that of contingent and 
necessary. Beings of a higher order are necessary and indestructible 
and unchangeable: from which condition beings fall away, the lower the 
rank in which they are placed; so that the lowest beings suffer 
destruction in their being and change in their constitution, and 
produce their effects, not necessarily, but contingently. Every agent 
therefore that is part of the universe endeavours, so far as it can, to 
abide in its being and natural constitution, and to establish its 
effect: but God, the governor of the universe, intends that of the 
effects which take place in it one be established as of necessity, 
another as of contingency; and with this view He applies different 
causes to them, necessary causes to these effects, contingent causes to 
those. It falls under divine providence therefore, not only that this 
effect be, but also that this effect be necessarily, that other 
contingently. Thus, of things subject to divine providence, some are 
necessary, and others contingent, not all necessary.<p> 

Hence it is clear that this conditional proposition is true: 'If God 
has foreseen this thing in the future, it will be.' But it will be as 
God has provided that it shall be; and supposing that He has provided 
that it shall be contingently, it follows infallibly that it will be 
contingently, and not necessarily.<p> 

Cicero (<i>De divinatione</i> ii, 8) has this argument: 'If all things 
are foreseen by God, the order of causes is certain; but if so, all 
things happen by fate, nothing is left in our power, and there is no 
such thing as free will.' A frivolous argument, for since not only 
effects are subject to divine providence, but also causes, and modes of 
being, it follows that though all things happen by divine providence, 
some things are so foreseen by God as that they are done freely by 
us.<p> 

Nor can the defectibility of secondary causes, by means of which the 
effects of providence are produced, take away the certainty of divine 
providence: for since God works in all things, it belongs to His 
providence sometimes to allow defectible causes to fail, and sometimes 
to keep them from failing.<p> 

The Philosopher shows <A HREF="gc3_94b.htm">*</a> that if every effect 
has a proper cause (<i>causam per se</i>), every future event may be 
reduced to some present or past cause. Thus if the question is put 
concerning any one, whether he is to be slain by robbers, that effect 
proceeds from a cause, his meeting with robbers; and that effect again 
is preceded by another cause, his going out of his house; and that 
again by another, his wanting to find water; the preceding cause to 
which is thirst, and this is caused by eating salt meat, which he 
either is doing or has done. If then, positing the cause, the effect 
must be posited of necessity, he must necessarily be thirsty, if he 
eats salt meat; and he must necessarily will to seek water, if he is 
thirsty; and be must necessarily go out of the house, if he wills to 
seek water; and the robbers must necessarily come across him, if he 
goes out of the house; and if they come across him, he must be killed. 
Therefore from first to last it is necessary for this man eating salt 
meat to be killed by robbers.<A HREF="gc3_94c.htm">*</a> The 
philosopher concludes that it is not true that, positing the cause, the 
effect must be posited, because there are some causes that may fail.<A 
HREF="gc3_94d.htm">*</a> Nor again is it true that every effect has a 
proper cause: for any accidental effect, e.g., of this man wishing to 
look for water and falling in with robbers, has no cause.<A
