<H1>That the Soul is not of the substance of God</h1>

The divine substance is eternal, and nothing appertaining to it begins 
anew to be (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_15.htm">XV</a>). But the souls of 
men were not before their bodies (Chap. <gc2_83.htm">LXXXIII</a>).<p> 

3. Everything out of which anything is made is in potentiality to that 
which is made out of it. But the substance of God, being pure 
actuality, is not in potentiality to anything (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_16.htm">XVI</a>).<p> 

4 and 5. That out of which anything is made is in some way changed. 
Moveover the soul of man is manifestly variable in point of knowledge, 
virtue, and their opposites. But God is absolutely unchangeable (B. I, 
Chap. <A HREF="gc1_12.htm">XII</a>): therefore nothing can be made out 
of Him, nor can the soul be of His substance.<p> 

7. Since the divine substance is absolutely indivisible, the soul 
cannot be of that substance unless it be the whole substance. But the 
divine substance cannot but be one (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_42.htm">XLII</a>). It would follow that all men have but one 
intellectual soul, a conclusion already rejected (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc2_75.htm">LXXV</a>).<A HREF="gc2_85a.htm">*</a><p> 

This opinion seems to have had three sources. Some assumed that there 
was no incorporeal being, and made the chiefest of corporeal substances 
God. Hence sprang the theory of the Manichean, that God is a sort of 
corporeal light, pervading all the infinities of space, and that the 
human soul is a small glimmer of this light. Others have posited the 
intellect of all men to be one, either active intellect alone, or 
active and potential combined. And because the ancients called every 
self-subsistent intelligence a deity, it followed that our soul, or the 
intellect whereby we understand, had a divine nature. Hence sundry 
professors of the Christian faith in our time, who assert the separate 
existence of the active intellect, have said expressly that the active 
intellect is God. This opinion might also have arisen from the likeness 
of our soul to God: for intelligence, which is taken to be the chief 
characteristic of Deity, is found to belong to no substance in the 
sublunary world except to man alone, on account of his soul.<p>
