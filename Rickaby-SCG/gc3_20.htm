<H1>How Things copy the Divine Goodness</h1>

Not all creatures are established in one and the same degree of 
goodness.  The substance of some is form and actuality, -- that is to 
say, something which, in point of essence, has the attribute of actual 
being and goodness.<A HREF="gc3_20a.htm">*</a>  The substance of other 
beings is composed of matter and form: this substance has the attribute 
of actual being and goodness, but only in respect of part of itself, 
namely, the form.  While then the divine substance is its own goodness, 
a simple substance (or pure spirit) partakes of this goodness to the 
extent of its essence, but a composite substance to the extent of some 
part of its essence.  In this third grade of substance again there is 
found a difference in being.  For, composed as they are of matter and 
form, the form of some of them fills the whole potentiality of the 
matter, so that there remains not in the matter any potentiality to any 
other form, and consequently not in any other matter any potentiality to 
<i>this</i> form: such are the heavenly bodies, into the essential 
constitution of which their whole matter enters.<A 
HREF="gc3_20b.htm">*</a>  In other bodies the form does not fill the 
whole potentiality of the matter: hence there still remains in the 
matter a potentiality to another form, and in some portion of matter 
there remains a potentiality to <i>this</i> form, as appears in the 
(four) elements and bodies composed thereof.  Now because a privation 
is a negation in a substance of that which may well be in the 
substance, it is clear that with this form, which does not fill the 
whole potentiality of the matter, there is compatible the privation of 
some form due to that substance.  No such privation can attach to a 
substance, the form of which fills the whole potentiality of its 
matter; nor to a substance which is essentially a form; still less to 
that Substance, whose very being is His essence.  Further it is clear 
that, since evil is the privation of good, there is in this lowest 
order of substances changeable good with admixture of evil, a 
changeableness to which the higher orders are not liable.<A 
HREF="gc3_20c.htm">*</a>  The substance therefore that ranks lowest in 
being is lowest also in rank of goodness.<p> 

We likewise find an order of goodness among the parts of a substance 
composed of matter and form.  For since matter, considered in itself, 
is potential being,<A HREF="gc3_20d.htm">*</a> while form is the 
actualisation of that being, and the substance composed of the two is 
actually existent through the form, the form will be good in itself; the 
composed substance will be good as it actually has the form; and the 
matter will be good inasmuch as it is in potentiality to the form.  But 
though everything is good in so far as it is being, it need not be 
supposed that matter, as it is only potential being, is only 
potentially good.  For 'being' is an absolute term, while there is 
goodness even in relation: for not only is a thing called 'good' 
because it is an end, or is in possession of an end, but also, though 
it has not yet arrived at any end, provided only it be ordained to some 
end, a thing is called 'good' even on that account.  Though then matter 
cannot absolutely be called 'being' on the title of its potentiality 
involving some relation to being, yet it may absolutely be called 
'good' on account of this very relation.  Herein it appears that 'good' 
is a term of wider extension than 'being.'<p> 

Yet in another way does the goodness of the creature fall short of the 
divine goodness.  As has been said, God possesses the highest 
perfection of goodness in his mere being: but a created thing does not 
possess its perfection in point of one attribute only, but in point of 
many: for what is united in the highest is multiple and manifold in the 
lowest.<A HREF="gc3_20e.htm">*</a>  Hence God is said to be fraught 
with virtue and wisdom and activity in one and the same respect, but a
creature in different respects.  The greater the distance at which a 
creature stands removed from the first and highest goodness, the greater 
the multiplication of points requisite for it to be perfectly good.  
But if it cannot attain to perfect goodness, it will hold on to an 
imperfect goodness in a few points.  Hence it is that, though the first 
and highest goodness is absolutely simple, and the substances nearest 
to it approach it alike in goodness and in simplicity, still the lowest 
substances are found to be more simple than other substances higher 
than they are, as the elements are more simple than animals and men, 
because they cannot attin to the perfection of knowledge and 
understanding to which animals and men attain.<A 
HREF="gc3_20f.htm">*</a>  It appears therefore from what has been said 
that, though God has His goodness perfect and entire in the simplicity 
of His being, creatures nevertheless do not attain to the perfection of 
their goodness by their mere being, but only by many details of being. 
Hence, though every one of these creatures is good in so far as it has 
being, still it cannot absolutely be called good if it is destitute of 
other qualities requisite for its goodness; as a man devoid of virtues 
and subject to vices is good in a certain way, inasmuch as he is a 
being and inasmuch as he is a man, but on the whole he is not good, but 
rather evil.  For no creature then is it the same thing to <i>be</i> 
and to <i>be good</i>, absolutely speaking, although every creature is 
good in so far as it has being: but for God it is quite the same thing 
to <i>be</i> and to <i>be good</i>, absolutely speaking.  Now, as it 
has been shown, everything tends finally to some likeness of the divine 
goodness; and a thing is likened to the divine goodness in respect of 
all the points which appertain to its own proper goodness; and the 
goodness of a thing consists not only in its being but in all other 
qualities requisite for its perfection: from which considerations the 
consequence is clear, that a thing is finally ordained to God, not only 
in its substantial being, but likewise in those accidental qualities 
that appertain to its perfection, and also in respect of its proper 
activity, which likewise belongs to the perfection of a thing.
