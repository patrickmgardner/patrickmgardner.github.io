<H1>Rejection of the aforesaid Opinion, and Solution of
the aforesaid Reasons</h1>

THE above opinion arises partly from custom, men being accustomed from 
the beginning to hear and invoke the name of God. Custom, especially 
that which is from the beginning, takes the place of nature; hence 
notions wherewith the mind is imbued from childhood are held as firmly 
as if they were naturally known and self-evident. Partly also it owes 
its origin to the neglect of a distinction between what is self-evident 
<i>of itself absolutely</i> and what is self-evident <i>relatively to 
us</i>.  Absolutely indeed the existence of God is self-evident, since 
God's essence is His existence.  But since we cannot mentally conceive 
God's essence, his existence is not self-evident relatively to us. <P> 

1. Nor is the existence of God necessarily self-evident as soon as the 
meaning of the name 'God' is known.  First, because it is not evident, 
even to all who admit the existence of God, that God is something 
greater than which nothing can be conceived, since many of the ancients 
said that this world was God.  Then granting that universal usage 
understands by the name 'God' something greater than which nothing can 
be conceived, it will not follow that there exists in rerum natura 
something greater than which nothing can be conceived.  For 'thing' and 
"notion implied in the name of the thing" must answer to one another. 
From the conception in the mind of what is declared by this name 'God' 
it does not follow that God exists otherwise than in the mind.  Hence 
there will be no necessity either of that something, greater than which 
nothing can be conceived, existing otherwise than in the mind; and from 
this it does not follow that there is anything <i>in rerum natura</i> 
greater than which nothing can be conceived.  And so the supposition of 
the nonexistence of God goes untouched. For the possibility of our 
thought outrunning the greatness of any given object, whether of the 
actual or of the ideal order, has nothing in it to vex the soul of any 
one except of him alone who already grants the existence <i>in rerum 
natura</i> of something than which nothing can be conceived greater.<A

2. Nor is it necessary for something greater than God to be 
conceivable, if His non-existence is conceivable. For the possibility 
of conceiving Him not to exist does not arise from the imperfection or 
uncertainty of His Being, since His Being is of itself most manifest, 
but from the infirmity of our understanding, which cannot discern Him 
as He is of Himself, but only by the effects which He produces; and so 
it is brought by reasoning to the knowledge of Him.<P> 

3. As it is self-evident to us that the whole is greater than its part, 
so the existence of God is most self-evident to them that see the 
divine essence, inasmuch as His essence is His existence. But because 
we cannot see His essence, we are brought to the knowledge of His 
existence, not by what He is in Himself but by the effects which He 
works.<A HREF="gc1_11b.htm">*</a><P> 

4. Man knows God naturally as he desires Him naturally. Now man desires 
Him naturally inasmuch as he naturally desires happiness, which is a 
certain likeness to the divine goodness. Thus it is not necessary that 
God, considered in Himself, should be naturally known to man, but a 
certain likeness of God. Hence man must be led to a knowledge of God 
through the likenesses of Him that are found in the effects which He 
works.<P> 

5. God is that wherein all things are known, not as though other things 
could not be known without His being known first, as happens in the 
case of self-evident principles, but because through His influence all 
knowledge is caused in us.<P></BODY>
