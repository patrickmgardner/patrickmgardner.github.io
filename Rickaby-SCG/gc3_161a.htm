This chapter is complementary to Chapter
<A HREF="gc3_156.htm">CLVI</a>. There we saw that a man in the state of
grace still needs a succession of actual graces to enable
him to observe the law of God on essential points
steadily and to the end. Here we learn that a man
in mortal sin needs actual graces to prevent his falling
deeper. This chapter follows from the former as the
less from the greater: for the victory that the man in
grace cannot gain, still less can the sinner gain. The
two chapters together argue that, left to his own unaided
nature, unsupported by the movements of actual grace,
every man capable of mortal sin will at times commit
such sin.
