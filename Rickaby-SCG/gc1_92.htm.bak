<H1>In what sense Virtues can be posited in God</h1>

AS the divine goodness comprehends within itself in a certain way all 
goodnesses, and virtue is a sort of goodness, the divine goodness must 
contain all virtues after a manner proper to itself. But no virtue is 
predicated as an attribute of God after the manner of a habit, as 
virtues are in us.  For it does not befit God to be good by anything 
superadded to Him, but only by His essence, since He is absolutely 
simple. Nor again does He act by anything superadded to His essence, as 
His essence is His being (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_45.htm">XLV</a>). Virtue 
therefore in God is not any habit, but His own essence.<p> 

2. A habit is an imperfect actuality, half-way between potentiality and 
actuality: hence the subjects of habits are compared to persons asleep.  
But in God actuality is most perfect.  Virtue therefore in Him is not 
like a habit or a science, but is as a present act of consciousness, 
which is the extremest perfection of actuality.<p> 

Since human virtues are for the guidance of human life, and human life 
is twofold, contemplative and active, the virtues of the active life, 
inasmuch as they perfect this present life, cannot be attributed to 
God: for the active life of man consists in the use of material goods, 
which are not assignable to God.  Again, these virtues perfect human 
conduct in political society: hence they do not seem much to concern 
those who keep aloof from political society: much less can they befit 
God, whose conversation and life is far removed from the manner and 
custom of human life.<A HREF="gc1_92a.htm">*</a> Some again of the 
virtues of the active life direct us how to govern the passions: but in 
God there are no passions.<A HREF="gc1_92b.htm">*</a>
