St Thomas does not deny the cognition of space to angels and 
disembodied spirits: but he says that distance does not limit their 
knowledge, as it limits our sense-perception, and our knowledge in 
consequence. Even the human mind, having once compassed the idea of a 
thing, thinks of the thing irrespective of distance, e.g., the depths 
of stellar space.
