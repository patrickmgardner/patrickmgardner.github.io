Porphyry wrote in Greek, where <b>phusei</b> ('naturally') 
is often used in the sense of 'thoroughly' (cf. 
Eph. ii, 3). It is Shakespeare's 'in grain,' as 'a fault
in grain' (<i>Comedy of Errors</i>, II, 3). In a <i>thoroughly</i>
wicked man wicked habits have grown into a sort of
second <i>nature</i>.
