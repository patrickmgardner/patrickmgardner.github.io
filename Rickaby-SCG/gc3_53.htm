<H1>That a Created Intelligence needs some influx of Divine Light to 
see God in His Essence</h1> 

IT is impossible for that which is the proper form of one thing to 
become the form of another thing, unless that latter thing comes to 
partake of some likeness to the former. But the divine essence is the 
proper intelligible form of the divine intelligence, and is 
proportioned to it: for in God these three are one, that which 
understands, that whereby it understands, and that which is 
understood. It is impossible therefore for the very essence of God to 
become an intelligible form to any created intellect otherwise than by 
the said intellect coming to be partaker in some likeness to God.<p> 

3. If two things, not previously united, come afterwards to be united, 
this must be either by a change in both or by a change in one of them. 
If therefore any created intellect begins anew to see the essence of 
God, the divine essence must be conjoined anew with that intellect by 
way of intelligible presentation. But it is impossible for the divine 
essence to change; and therefore such union must begin by some change 
in the created intellect, that is to say, by its making some new 
acquisition.<p> 

But because we arrive at the knowledge of things intelligible through 
things sensible, we also transfer the names of sensible cognition to 
intelligible cognition, and particularly the properties of sight, 
which among senses is the nobler and more spiritual and more akin to 
intellect: hence intellectual knowledge itself is called sight, or 
vision. And because bodily vision is not accomplished except through 
light, the means whereby intellectual vision is fulfilled borrow the 
name of light. That disposition therefore whereby a created 
intelligence is raised to the intellectual vision of the divine 
substance is called the 'light of glory.'<p> 

This is the light of which it is said: <i>In thy light we shall see 
light</i> (Ps. xxxv, 10), to wit, of the divine substance; and, <i>The 
city needeth not sun nor moon, for the brightness of God illuminateth 
it</i> (Apoc. xxi, 23); and, <i>No more shall there be sun to shine on 
thee by day, nor brightness of moon to enlighten thee, but the  Lord 
shall be to thee an everlasting light, and thy God shall be thy 
glory</i> Isaias lx, 19). And because in God being and understanding 
are the same and He is to all the cause of understanding, He is on that 
account called 'light': <i>He was the true light, that enlighteneth 
every man coming into this world</i> John i, 8)<A HREF="gc3_53a.htm">*</a>:
<i>God is light</i> (1 John i, 5): <i>Clad in light as in a garment</i> 
(Ps. ciii, 2). And therefore also as well God as the angels in Holy 
Scripture are described in figures of fire, because of the brightness 
of fire.<p>
