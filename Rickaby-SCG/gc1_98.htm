<H1>That God is His own Life</h1>

IN living things, to live is to be: for a living thing is said to be 
alive inasmuch as it has a soul; and by that soul, as by its own proper 
form, it has being: living in fact is nothing else than living being, 
arising out of a living form.<A HREF="gc1_98a.htm">*</a> But, in God, 
Himself is His own being (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_22.htm">XXII</a>): Himself 
therefore is His own life.<p> 

2. To understand is to live: but God is His own act of understanding 
(Chap. <A HREF="gc1_45.htm">XLV</a>).<p> 

3. If God is living, there must be life in Him. If then He is not His 
own life, there will be something in Him that is not Himself,<A 
HREF="gc1_98b.htm">*</a> and thus He will be compound, -- a rejected 
conclusion (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_18.htm">XVIII</a>).<p> 

And this is the text: <i>I am life</i> (John xiv, 6).<A
