<H1>Of the Punishment due to Mortal and Venial Sins respectively in 
regard to the Last End</h1>

MAN may sin in either of two ways, either so that the intention of his 
mind be quite turned away from subordination to God, the final good, 
and that is a mortal sin: or otherwise so that, while the mind's 
intention remains fixed on the final end, some obstacle is put in the 
way to retard its free movement to the end, and that is a venial sin.<A 
HREF="gc3_144a.htm">*</a> As then the difference of punishments must be 
according to the difference of sins, it follows that whoever sins 
mortally must have for his punishment to be cast out from the 
attainment of his end; but he who sins venially is punished, not by 
being cast out, but by being retarded or experiencing difficulty in 
gaining his end; for so the equality of justice is preserved, in that 
as man, by sinning [venially], voluntarily turns aside from his end, so 
in suffering punishment, against his will, he should be impeded in the 
gaining of that end.<A HREF="gc3_144b.htm">*</a><p> 

3. When any one attains a good thing that he was not intending, that is 
by luck and chance. If then he whose intention is turned away from the 
last end were to gain that last end, it would be by luck and chance, -- 
which is an absurd thing to suppose, seeing that the last end is a good 
of intelligence, and luck and chance are inconsistent with intelligent 
action, because chance events come about without the direction of 
intelligence: it is absurd then to suppose intelligence gaining its 
end by an unintelligent method. He then will not gain his end, who by 
sinning mortally has his intention turned away from his last end.<p> 

5. In an orderly course of means leading up to an end such a relation 
obtains that, if the end is or is to be, the means thereto must be: if 
the means to the end are not forthcoming, neither will the end be 
forthcoming: for if the end could be secured without the means to the 
end being taken, it would be labour lost to seek the end by the taking 
of such means. But it is by arts of virtue, the chief element in which 
is an intention of the due end, that man attains to his last end and 
happiness (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_141.htm">CXLI</a>). Whoever then acts 
against virtue, and turns his back on his last end, it is proper for 
him to suffer deprivation of that end.<p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity</i> 
(Matt. vii, 23).
