Aristotle probably reckoned an act of speculative 
wisdom, or a scientific discovery, to be a better
thing than an act of fortitude or temperance. St
Thomas uses Aristotelian language, but can hardly
mean more by it than this, that, other things being
equal, an act is morally better, the more fully it represents 
the choice of 'reason,' that is, of the 'rational
will.' On the ethical value of acts of pure intellect, as
compared with acts of the conative faculties -- a 
difficult point, generally neglected -- cf. <i>Ethics and Natural
Law</i>, pp. 73-77, Sect. III.
