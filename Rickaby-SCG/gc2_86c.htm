<i>Annulosa</i>, St Thomas calls them: they are now known as 
<i>Annelidae</i>, worms, centipedes, and the like. The cutting of an 
Annelid in two is not a case of reproduction. But in the lowest animal 
life, that of <i>Amoebae</i>, there is a true reproduction by 
'fissure'; as also in the propagation of plants by cuttings.<p> 

The kindness of a medical friend suplies me with the following statement:<p>

"When the body of an Annelid, say an earthworm, is divided, as by the 
stroke of a spade, the animal does not necessarily die, does not 
necessarily live. The principal nerve gangia are situated in the head, 
and though the severed part, remote from this, so-called, central 
nervous system, will have no restorative power and will die, the 
segment containing the nerve masses -- 'brain' -- may restore or 
reproduce the missing opposite extremity, or a semblance of it. But, if 
the injury were very near the head, so that almost all the vital 
organs, viscera, etc., were included in the segment remote from the 
nerve ganglia, death would occur, not even the nerve ganglia in the 
head having the power to restore or reproduce an almost entirely new 
body, viscera, blood vessels, etc. So, while one part may live, both 
parts may die. It depends upon the amount and importance of the part 
or parts to be reproduced, or restored."<p>
