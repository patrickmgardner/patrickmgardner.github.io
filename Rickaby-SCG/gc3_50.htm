<H1>That the desire of Pure Intelligences does not rest
satisfied in the Natural Knowledge which they have of God</h1>

EVERYTHING that is imperfect in any species desires to gain the 
perfection of that species. He who has an opinion about a thing, 
opinion being an imperfect knowledge of the thing, is thereby egged on 
to desire a scientific knowledge of the thing.<A 
HREF="gc3_50a.htm">*</a> But the aforesaid knowledge, which pure 
spirits have of God without knowing His substance fully, is an 
imperfect kind of knowledge. The main point in the knowledge of 
anything is to know precisely what it essentially is. Therefore this 
knowledge which pure spirits have of God does not set their natural 
desire to rest, but rather urges it on to see the divine substance.<p> 

2. The knowledge of effects kindles the desire of knowing the cause: 
this search after causes set men upon philosophising. Therefore the 
desire of knowing, naturally implanted in all intelligent beings, does 
not rest unless, after finding out the substances of things made, they 
come also [<i>etiam</i>, not <i>etiamsi</i>] to know the cause on which 
those substances depend. By the fact then of pure spirits knowing that 
God is the cause of all the substances which they see, the natural 
desire in them does not rest unless they come also to see the substance 
of God Himself.<p> 

4. Nothing finite can set to rest the desire of intelligence. Given any 
finite thing, intelligence always sets to work to apprehend something 
beyond it. But the height and power of every created substance is 
finite. Therefore the intelligence of a created spirit rests not in the 
knowledge of any created substances, however excellent, but tends still 
further in a natural desire to understand that substance which is of 
infinite height and excellence, namely, the divine substance (Chap. 
<A HREF="gc3_43.htm">XLIII</a>).<p> 

6. The nearer a thing is to the goal, the greater is its desire. But 
the intelligences of pure spirits are nearer to the knowledge of God 
than is our intelligence: therefore they desire that knowledge more 
intensely than we do. But even we, however much we know that God exists 
and has the attributes above mentioned, have not our desire assuaged, 
but still further desire to know God in His essence: much more then do 
pure spirits. The conclusion is, that the final happiness of pure 
spirits is not in that knowledge of God whereby they know Him through 
knowing their own substances, but their desire leads them further to 
the substance of God.<p> 

Hereby it sufficiently appears that final happiness is to be sought in 
no other source than in activity of intellect, since no desire carries 
so high as the desire of understanding truth. All our other desires, be 
they of pleasure or of anything else desirable by man, may rest in 
other objects; but the aforesaid desire rests not until it arrives at 
God, on whom all creation hinges and who made it all. Hence Wisdom 
aptly says: <i>I dwell in the heights of heaven, and my throne is in 
the pillar of a cloud</i> (Ecclus xxiv, 7) ; and it is said, <i>Wisdom 
calls her handmaids to the citadel</i> (Prov. ix, 3). Let them blush 
therefore who seek in basest things the happiness of man so highly 
placed.<A HREF="gc3_50b.htm">*</a>
