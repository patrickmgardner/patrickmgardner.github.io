<H1>That the Final Happiness Man does not consist in 
Acts of the Moral Virtues</h1>

HUMAN happiness, if it is final, is not referable to any further end. 
But all moral acts are referable to something further: thus acts of 
fortitude in war are directed to securing victory and peace: acts of 
justice to the preservation of peace amongst men by every one remaining 
in quiet possession of his own.<p> 

2. Moral virtues aim at the observance of the golden mean in passions 
and in the disposal of external things. But the moderation of the 
passions or of external things cannot possibly be the final end of 
human life, since these very passions and external things are referable 
to something else.<p> 

3. Man is man by the possession of reason; and therefore happiness, his 
proper good, must regard what is proper to reason. But that is more 
proper to reason which reason has in itself than what it does in 
another. Since then the good of moral virtue is something which reason 
establishes in things other than itself, moral virtue cannot be the 
best thing in man, which is happiness.<A HREF="gc3_34a.htm">*</a>
