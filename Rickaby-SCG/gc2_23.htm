<H1>That God's Action in Creation is not of Physical Necessity, but of Free 
Choice of Will</h1>

The power of every necessary agent is determined and limited to one 
effect. That is the reason why all physical effects always come out in 
the same way, unless there be some interference: but acts of the will 
not so. But the divine power is not directed to one effect only (Chap. 
<A HREF="gc2_22.htm">XXII</a>). God then does not act by physical 
necessity, but by will.<A HREF="gc2_23a.htm">*</a><p> 

2. Whatever does not involve a contradiction, is within the range of 
the divine power. But many things that do not exist in creation would 
still involve no contradiction if they did exist. This is most 
evidently the case in regard of the number and size and distances of 
the stars and other bodies. They would present no contradiction, no 
intrinsic absurdity, if they were arranged on another plan. Many things 
therefore lie within the range of divine power, that are not found in 
nature. But whoever does some and leaves out others of the things that 
he can do, acts by choice of will and not by physical necessity.<A 
HREF="gc2_23b.htm">*</a><p> 

4. Since God's action is His substance (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_73.htm">LXXIII</a>), the divine action cannot come under the 
category of those acts that are 'transient' and not in the agent, but 
must be an act 'immanent' in the agent, such as are acts of knowing and 
desiring, and none other. God therefore acts and operates by knowing 
and willing.<p> 

6. A self-determined agent is prior to an agent determined from 
without: for all that is determined from without is reducible to what 
is self-determined, or we should have process to infinity. But he who 
is not master of his own action is not self-determined: for he acts as 
led by another, not as his own leader. The prime agent then must act in 
such a way as to remain master of his own action. But no one is master 
of his own action except he be a voluntary agent.<p> 

7. Will-action is naturally prior to physical action: for that is 
naturally prior which is more perfect, albeit in the individual it be 
posterior in time. But will-action is the more perfect, as within our 
experience voluntary agents are more perfect than physical. Therefore 
will-action must be assigned to God, the prime agent.<p> 

8. Where will-action and physical action go together, will-action 
represents the higher power and uses the other as an instrument. But 
the divine power is supreme, and therefore must act by will-action, not 
under physical necessity.<p> 

This truth also divine Scripture teaches us. <i>All things, whatsoever 
he hath willed, the Lord hath done</i> (Ps. cxxxiv, 6): <i>Who worketh 
all things according to the counsel of his will</i> (Eph. i, 11).<p>
