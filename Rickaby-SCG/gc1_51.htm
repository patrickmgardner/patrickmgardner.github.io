<H1>Some Discussion of the Question how there is in the
Divine Understanding a Multitude of Objects</h1>

THIS Multitude cannot be taken to mean that many objects of 
understanding have a distinct being in God.  For these objects of 
understanding would be either the same with the divine essence, and at 
that rate multitude would be posited in the essence of God, a doctrine 
above rejected on many grounds (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_31.htm">XXXI</a>); 
or they would be additions made to the divine essence, and at that rate 
there would be in God some accident, which we have above shown to be an 
impossibility (Chap. <A HREF="gc1_33.htm">XXXIII</a>). Nor again can 
there be posited any separate existence of these intelligible forms, 
which seems to have been the position of Plato, who, by way of avoiding 
the above inconveniences, introduced the doctrine of Ideas. For the 
forms of physical things cannot exist without matter, as neither can 
they be understood without matter.  And even supposing them so to 
exist, even this would not suffice to explain God understanding a 
multitude of objects. For, assuming the aforesaid forms to exist 
outside the essence of God, and that God could not understand the 
multitude of things without them, such understanding being requisite to 
the perfection of His intellect, it would follow that God's perfection 
in understanding depended on another being than Himself, and 
consequently His perfection in being, seeing that His being is His 
understanding: the contrary of all which has been shown (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_40.htm">XL</a>). Moreover, assuming what shall be proved 
hereafter (Bk II, Chap. XV), that whatever is beyond the essence of God 
is caused by God, the above forms, if they are outside of God, must 
necessarily be caused by Him. But He is cause of things by His 
understanding, as shall be shown (Bk II, Chap.  XXIII, XXIV). Therefore 
God's understanding of these intelligible forms is a natural 
prerequisite for the existence of such forms. God's understanding then 
of the multitude of creatures is not to be explained by the existence 
of many intelligible abstract forms outside of God.
