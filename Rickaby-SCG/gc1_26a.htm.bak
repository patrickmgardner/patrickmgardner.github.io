If all things agreed in being -- and that the 
divine being -- all things would agree also in nature, since
the being of God is simply identical with His nature.
Agreeing at once in being and in nature, they would
agree all over, all would be absolutely one, and one
great and sole Reality would pervade and constitute
the universe. To erect such a 'Reality,' or 'Idea,' or
'Absolute,' and then to proclaim it God, is 
pantheism. St Thomas argues that this all-pervading entity
is not the universe, still less is it God: it has no 
concrete existence whatever: it is the shallowest, poorest
and barest of the mind's creations, extending to and
denoting everything, and therefore meaning and 
comprehending next to nothing.  In its fourth canon, <i>De
Deo Creatore</i>, the Vatican Council anathematises any
who say that "God is a universal or indefinite being,
which by self-determination constitutes the universe."
