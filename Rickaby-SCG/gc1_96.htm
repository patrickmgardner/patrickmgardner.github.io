<H1>That God hates nothing</h1>

AS love is to good, so is hatred to evil; we wish good to them whom we 
love, and evil to them whom we hate.  If then the will of God cannot be 
inclined to evil, as has been shown (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_95.htm">XCV</a>), it is impossible for Him to hate 
anything.<p> 

2. The will of God tends to things other than Himself inasmuch as, by 
willing and loving His own being and goodness, He wishes it to be 
diffused as far as is possible by communication of His likeness.  This 
then is what God wills in beings other than Himself, that there be in 
them the likeness of His goodness.  Therefore God wills the good of 
everything, and hates nothing.<p>

4. What is found naturally in all active causes, must be found 
especially in the Prime Agent.  But all agents in their own way love 
the effects which they themselves produce, as parents their children, 
poets their own poems, craftsmen their works.  Much more therefore is 
God removed from hating anything, seeing that He is cause of all.<A 
HREF="gc1_96a.htm">*</a><p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Thou lovest all things that are, and hatest 
nothing of the things that Thou hast made</i> (Wisd. xi, 25).<p> 

Some things however God is said, to hate figuratively 
(<i>similitudinarie</i>), and that in two ways.  The first way is this, 
that God, in loving things and willing their good to be, wills their 
evil not to be: hence He is said to have hatred of evils, for the 
things we wish not to be we are said to hate.  So it is said: <i>Think 
no evil in your hearts every one of you against his friend, and love no 
lying oath: for all these are things that I hate, saith the Lord</i> 
(Zach. viii, 17).  But none of these things are effects of creation: 
they are not as subsistent things, to which hatred or love properly 
attaches. The other way is by God's wishing some greater good, which 
cannot be without the privation of a lesser good; and thus He is said 
to hate, whereas it is more properly love. Thus inasmuch as He wills 
the good of justice, or of the order of the universe, which cannot be 
without the punishment or perishing of some, He is said to hate those 
beings whose punishment or perishing He wills, according to the text, 
<i>Esau I have hated</i> (Malach. i, 3); and, <i>Thou hatest all who 
work Iniquity, thou wilt destroy all who utter falsehood: the man of 
blood and deceit the Lord shall abominate (Ps. v, 7).<A
