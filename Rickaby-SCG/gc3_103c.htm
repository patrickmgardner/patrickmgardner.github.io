Were angels in the habit of using bodily instruments 
to bodily effects within the circle of our
experience, we could no more call the felling of a
tree by an angel with an axe 'miraculous' than the
ordinary action of the woodman. Such angelic activities
were scarcely regarded by St Thomas's age as
extraordinary occurrences. They thought that spirits
frequently meddled with sublunary things. We should
count any such interference extraordinary; and if we
believed it to be the interference of a good angel,
acting within his own power by divine permission,
we should not hesitate to call it a miracle. We have
to consider, not merely what the angels can do physically, 
but what God allows them to do in this lower
world. He seems to allow them frequently to influence
men's minds, but seldom to play any part in the
production of physical phenomena. It would be more
true to say that angels make men their instruments
than that they use material things instrumentally.
