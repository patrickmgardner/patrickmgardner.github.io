<H1>That in God there is no Composition</h1>

IN every compound there must be actuality and potentiality. For a 
plurality of things cannot become one thing, unless there be actuality 
and potentiality.  For things that are not one absolutely, are not 
actually united except by being in a manner tied up together or driven 
together: in which case the parts thus got together are in potentiality 
in respect of union; for they combine actually, after having been 
potentially combinable. But in God there is no potentiality: therefore 
there is not in Him any composition.<A HREF="gc1_18a.htm">*</a><P> 

3. Every compound is potentially soluble in respect of its being 
compound, although in some cases there may be some other fact that 
stands in the way of dissolution. But what is soluble is in 
potentiality not to be, which cannot be said of God, seeing that He is 
of Himself a necessary Being.
