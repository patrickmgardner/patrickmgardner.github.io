Even Plato consigns to everlasting punishment
the "incurably wicked" tyrant, Ardiaeus (<i>Rep.</i>
615-6; <i>Gorgias</i>, 525b.c.; <i>Phaedo</i>, 113e), as an 
example to others. Aristotle distinguishes <i>chastisement</i>
from <i>vengeance</i>, the former being "for the sake of
him who offers it," the latter "for his sake who
takes it " (<i>Rhet.</i> I, x, 17). And we read of One who
says, <i>Vengeance is mine</i> (Rom. xii, 19). All this notion
of vindictive, retrospective, or retributive punishment
proceeds upon the doctrine of free will: it is inconsistent 
with determinism. And that is one of the objections to determinism.
