Understand, any 'human act.' No man is happy by the beating of his 
heart. The proof that happiness consists in an activity of the best in 
man may be put scholastically thus. -- Being is good. Every being, 
according to its kind and capacity, asserts itself and aims at 
maintaining itself: this we may call the self-preservative 
<i>nisus</i>. Every being, that is capable of development, aims, not at 
mere maintenance, but at development of self.  This effort after 
development is the Aristotelian <b>phusis</b>. In a conscious and 
intelligent being, the successful maintenance and development of self 
is happiness, which might be defined <i>conscia plenitudo essendi</i>. 
Being (<i>esse</i>) carries power (<i>posse</i>), and power carries act 
(<i>agere</i>). Power is called by Aristotle the first actuality, and 
act the second actuality. Being is in its full development when it 
reaches the second actuality. Man therefore is in the fullness of 
being, and therefore man is happy, when he is in the best second 
actuality of which his nature is capable; and that, as Aristotle 
proves, and St Thomas after him (Chapp. <A HREF="gc3_26.htm">XXVI</a>, 
<A HREF="gc3_37.htm">XXXVII</a>), is the act of contemplation. -- 
Whether this demonstration is sufficiently observant of the essential 
sociableness of human nature, is a point to consider. Is self complete 
in the individual, and not rather in society? Heaven is the <i>New 
Jerusalem</i> (Apoc. xxi, 2) and Jerusalem is the <i>city of the great 
King</i> (Matt.v, 35).
