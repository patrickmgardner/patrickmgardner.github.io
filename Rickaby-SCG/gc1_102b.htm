It would follow from this, that a man cannot
perfectly comprehend an angel, nor even another
man vastly superior to himself.  The saint then, on
some points of his character, is not amenable to the

nor the philosopher, or theologian, or man of science,
to the unrevised verdict of the plain man; nor the
statesman, or hero, to the man in the street.
