This common Hegelian position is that the world is necessary to God, 
and the whole arrangement of the universe likewise an <i>a priori</i> 
necessity, nothing else being possible: in fact that the term 'actual 
being' includes at once all that is and all that ever could be, while 
the terms 'possible,' 'necessary,' 'contingent,' express nothing 
whatever but certain limitations of our field of view. Neither Hegel, 
nor any sane man who believes in a God at all, could ever suppose that 
there were things, producible in themselves, which could not be 
produced because God did not know of them. One wonders what opponents 
St Thomas could have met guilty of this absurdity. <i>Ex hypothesi</i> 
God is a Being whose mental vision extends everywhere; so that what God 
has no idea of, must be blank nonsense, and impossible as nonsensical. 
To Hegelians, however, God is exhausted in the production, or evolution 
of the universe: He gives being, and that of necessity, to all things 
whatsoever to which He possibly can give being: nothing realisable, or 
actualisable, remains behind, nothing potential. St Thomas meets this 
by insisting that God is infinite, and therefore inexhaustible; ten 
thousand such worlds as this would not exhaust His capacity of 
production; and over them all He would still remain, immeasurably 
exalted, distinct, independent, supreme.  There is however something, 
-- we cannot call it a limitation, but we may call it a condition of 
divine intelligence and creative power, -- a condition less regarded by 
St Thomas, but forcibly commending itself to us, upon six centuries 
longer experience of the prevalence of evil on earth. Fewer 
combinations, far fewer perhaps, than St Thomas thought possible, and 
our short-sighted impatience might crave for as remedial, may be really 
possible at all. The range of intrinsic impossibilities may extend 
considerably, beyond the abstract regions of logic and mathematics, 
into the land of concrete physical realities, one reality, if existent, 
necessarily involving, or necessarily barring, the existence of some 
other reality. Such necessity, such there be, is no limitation of 
divine power or divine intelligence. God still discerns endless 
possibilities, and can do whatever He discerns as possible; but much 
that men take for possibility is rendered on this hypothesis sheer 
absurdity, -- as impossible, let us say, as a 'spiritual elephant.' We 
wonder why God does not mend matters, as we would mend them, had we His 
power. Had we His power, we should also have His intelligence, and 
discern that there is no riding out of our troubles on the backs of 
spiritual elephants. There is some hint of the matter of this note in
