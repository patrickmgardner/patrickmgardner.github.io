<h1>Answer to the Difficulty raised in respect of the Breaking of the 
Host</h1>

IT has been said above (Chap. <A HREF="gc4_64.htm">LXIV</a>) that the 
substance of the Body of Christ is in this Sacrament by virtue of the 
Sacrament [Sacramental words]: but the dimensions of the Body of Christ 
are there by the natural concomitance which they have with the 
substance. This is quite the opposite way to that in which a body 
naturally is in place.<A HREF="gc4_67a.htm">*</a> A body is in place by 
means of its dimensions, by which it is made commensurate with its 
place.<A HREF="gc4_67b.htm">*</a><p> 

But substantial being and quantitative being do not stand in the same 
way related to that in which they are. Quantitative being is in a 
whole, but is not whole in each part: it is part in part, and whole in 
the whole.<A HREF="gc4_67c.htm">*</a> But substantial being is whole in 
the whole, and whole in every part of the same, as the whole nature and 
species of water is in every drop of water, and the whole soul in every 
part of the body.<A HREF="gc4_67d.htm">*</a> Since then the Body of 
Christ is in the Sacrament by reason of its substance, into which the 
substance of bread is changed, while the dimensions of bread remain, -- 
it follows that as the whole species of bread was under every part of 
its (visible) dimensions, so the whole Body of Christ is under every 
part of the same. The breaking then (of the Host) does not reach to the 
Body of Christ, as though the Body of Christ were subjected to that 
breaking: its subject is the dimensions of bread, which remain.<A
