<H1>That God has not brought things into being in discharge of any 
Debt of Justice</h1>  

JUSTICE is to another, rendering him his due. But, antecedently to the  
universal production of all things, nothing can be presupposed to which  
anything is due.<p>  

2. An act of justice must be preceded by some act, whereby something is 
made another's own; and that act, whereby first something is made 
another's own, cannot be an act of justice.<A HREF="gc2_28a.htm">*</a> 
But by creation a created thing first begins to have anything of its 
own. Creation then cannot proceed from any debt of justice.<p>  

3. No man owes anything to another, except inasmuch as he in some way 
depends on him, receiving something from him. Thus every man is in his 
neighbour's debt on God's account; from whom we have received all 
things. But God depends on none, and needs nothing of any.<p>  

5. Though nothing created precedes the universal production of all 
things, something uncreated does precede it: for the divine goodness 
precedes as the end and prime motive of creation, according to 
Augustine, who says: "Because God is good, we exist" (<i>De Verb. 
Apost. Serm.</i> 13). But the divine goodness needs nothing external 
for its perfection. Nor is it necessary, for all that God wills His own 
goodness, that He should will the production of things other than 
Himself. God wills His own goodness necessarily, but He does not 
necessarily will other things. Therefore the production of creatures is 
not a debt of necessity to the divine goodness. But, taking justice in 
the wider sense of the term, there may be said to be justice in the 
creation of the world, inasmuch as it befits the divine goodness.<p> 

7. But if we consider the divine plan, according as God has planned it 
in His understanding and will to bring things into being, from that 
point of view the production of things does proceed from the necessity 
of the divine plan (B. I, Chap. <A HREF="gc1_83.htm">LXXXIII</a>): for 
it is impossible for God to have planned the doing of anything, and 
afterwards not to do it. Thus fulfilment is necessarily due to His 
every plan. But this debt is not sufficient to constitute a claim of 
justice, properly so called, in the action of God creating the world: 
for justice, properly so called, is not of self to self.  Hence it is 
said: <i>Who hath first given to Him, and recompense shall be made 
him?</i> (Rom. xi, 35.) <i>Who hath first given to me, that I may repay 
him?</i> (Job xli, 2.)<p> 

Hereby is shut out the error of some who have tried to prove that God 
can do no otherwise than as He does, because He can do no otherwise 
than as He owes, or ought.<p>
