<H1>Against those who maintain that the Potential Intellect is the 
Phantasy<A HREF="gc2_67a.htm">*</a></h1>

PHANTASY is found in other animals besides man, the proof of which is 
that, as objects of sense recede from sense, these animals still shun 
or pursue them. But intellect is not in them, as no work of 
intelligence appears in their conduct.<p>

2. Phantasy is only of things corporeal and singular; but intellect, of 
things universal and incorporeal.<A HREF="gc2_67b.htm">*</a><p>

4. Intelligence is not the actualisation of any bodily organ. But 
phantasy has a fixed bodily organ.<A HREF="gc2_67c.htm">*</a><p>

Hence it is said: <i>Who teacheth us above the beasts of the earth, and 
above the fowls of the air instructeth us</i> (Job xxxv, 11): whereby 
we are given to understand that there is in man a certain cognitive 
power, above the sense and fancy that are in other animals.
