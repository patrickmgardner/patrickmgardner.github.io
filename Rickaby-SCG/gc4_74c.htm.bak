One could have wished St Thomas here to have
told us what he knew of any variation of Ordinal in
local churches of his time; what ceremonies were
comparatively recent, and what more ancient and
primitive. Had any one in Paris, Rome, or Naples,
an old Sacramentary or Pontifical that St Thomas
could have looked into, and compared its formularies
with those by which he himself was ordained? But
the spirit of documentary research slumbered in the
thirteenth century, except for the quest (or invention)
of charters and bulls of privilege.<p>
