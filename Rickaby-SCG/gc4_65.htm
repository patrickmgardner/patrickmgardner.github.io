<h1>The Difficulty of the Accidents remaining</h1>

IT cannot be denied that the accidents of bread and wine do remain, as 
the infallible testimony of the senses assures us. Nor is the Body and 
Blood of Christ affected by them, since that could not be without 
change in Him, and He is not susceptible of such accidents. It follows 
that they remain without subject. Nor is their so remaining an 
impossibility to the divine power. The same rule applies to the 
production of things and to their conservation in being. The power of 
God can produce the effects of any secondary causes whatsoever without 
the causes themselves, because that power is infinite, and supplies to 
all secondary causes the power in which they act: hence it can preserve 
in being the effects of secondary causes without the causes. Thus in 
this Sacrament it preserves the accident in being, after removing the 
substance that preserves it.<A HREF="gc4_65a.htm">*</a>
