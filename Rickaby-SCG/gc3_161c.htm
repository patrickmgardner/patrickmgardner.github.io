It may be asked: How can he be forestalled by
any aid of grace, who puts obstacles in the way of
grace, by being already in sin and going on to fresh
sin? The answer is, that grace and good will are
strong enough to break down any obstacle. But in
this case a great grace is needed, e.g., a thorough
fright. And that is the <i>rationale</i> of the sermons on
hell that are preached in Lenten missions. They
are as heavy siege artillery to breach the castle of the
<i>strong man armed</i> (Luke xi, 21).
