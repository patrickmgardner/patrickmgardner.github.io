<H1>That God understands all things at once and together</h1>

THE reason why our understanding cannot understand many things together 
in one act is because in the act of understanding the mind becomes one 
with the object understood;<A HREF="gc1_55a.htm">*</a> whence it 
follows that, were the mind to understand many things together in one 
act, it would be many things together, all of one genus, which is 
impossible. Intellectual impressions are all of one genus: they are of 
one type of being in the existence which they have in the mind, 
although the things of which they are impressions do not agree in one 
type of being: hence the contrariety of things outside the mind does 
not render the impressions of those things in the mind contrary to one 
another.  And hence it is that when many things are taken together, 
being anyhow united, they are understood together.  Thus a continuous 
whole is understood at once, not part by part; and a proposition is 
understood at once, not first the subject and then the predicate: 
because all the parts are known by one mental impression of the 
whole.<A HREF="gc1_55b.htm">*</a>  Hence we gather that whatever 
several objects are known by one mental presentation, can be 
understood together: but God knows all things by that one presentation 
of them, which is His essence; therefore He can understand all together 
and at once.<P>

2. The faculty of knowledge does not know anything actually without 
some attention and advertence.  Hence the phantasms, stored in the 
sensorium, are at times not actually in the imagination, because no 
attention is given to them. We do not discern together a multitude of 
things to which we do not attend together: but things that necessarily 
fall under one and the same advertence and attention, are necessarily 
understood together. Thus whoever institutes a comparison of two 
things, directs his attention to both and discerns both together. But 
all things that are in the divine knowledge must necessarily fall under 
one advertence; for God is attentive to behold His essence perfectly, 
which is to see it to the whole reach of its virtual content, which 
includes all things.  God therefore, in beholding His essence, discerns 
at once all things that are.<P> 

6. Every mind that understands one thing after another, is sometimes 
potentially intelligent, sometimes actually so; for while it 
understands the first thing actually, it understands the second 
potentially. But the divine mind is never potentially intelligent, but 
always actually: it does not, then, understand things in succession, 
but all at once.<P>

Holy Scripture witnesses to this truth, saying that with God there is 
<i>no change nor shadow of vicissitude</i> (James i, 17).
