The doctrine refuted in this chapter is known
in more recent philosophy as Occasionalism. 
"Occasionalism . . . . teaches that created things are the
mere occasions on which the Divinity takes the 
opportunity to act conformably to the requirements of the
objects present; this theory is especially characteristic
of the school of Descartes, and is in intimate connexion 
with the reduction of matter by that philosopher 
to extension, with inertia for its chief property.
Matter, according to him, can itself do nothing: It is
a mere receptivity and channel of communication or
transference for the motion imparted by the Creator;
it can hand about movement from particle to particle,
but it cannot originate or destroy any; and thus it is
opposed to mind, the very essence of which is thought
or activity. Matter is inert extension, thought is ever
operative inextension, etc." See <i>General Metaphysics</i>,
Stonyhurst Series, pp. 308-313.
