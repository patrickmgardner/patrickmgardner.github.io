When St Thomas speaks of <i>quantitas dimensiva</i>, he means 'visible 
bulk.' Of invisible bulk he took no note at all. He says (Chap. LXIII, 
not translated):<p> 

"If the substance of bread were resolved into its prime corporeal 
elements, this change would necessarily be perceptible to sense, since 
corporeal elements are sensible." By 'corporeal elements' he meant 
fire, air, earth, and water. The schoolmen herein followed Aristotle; 
Aristotle followed Plato; and Plato had a singular dislike for 
Democritus, the author of the atomic theory. Compare however the 
elemental <b>trigona</b> of <i>Timaeus</i>, 53 sq., which triangular 
atoms Plato expressly declares to be invisible. Every chemist and 
electrician now recognises that visible bulk is not of the essence of 
material substance; and the question stands open, whether the ultimate 
elements of such substance have any bulk, even invisible, -- whether they 
are extended at all. But every body is extended, still more every 
living body, in its natural state. We say then that the Body of Christ 
is not in the Sacrament of the Altar in its natural state.<p>
