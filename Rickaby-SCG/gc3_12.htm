<H1>That Evil does not entirely swallow up Good</h1>

The subject of evil must always remain, if evil is to remain.  But the 
subject of evil is good: therefore good always remains.<p>

But on the contingency of evil being infinitely intensified, and good 
being continually diminished by that intensification of evil, it 
appears that good may be diminished by evil even to infinity.  And the 
good so diminished must be finite, for infinite good is not capable of 
evil.  It seems then that in time good may be entirely taken away by 
evil.<p>

This then is the reply.  Evil, as we have seen, entirely takes away the 
good to which it is opposed, as blindness takes away sight: but there 
must remain that good which is the subject of evil, which subject, as 
such, bears a character of goodness, inasmuch as it is in potentiality 
to the actuality of good, whereof it is deprived by evil.<A 
HREF="gc3_12a.htm">*</a>   The less then it is in potentiality to that 
good, the less good it will be.  But a subject comes to be less in 
potentiality, or openness to a form, not only by the subtraction of 
some part of its potentiality, which is tantamount to subtraction of 
part of the subject itself, but also by the said potentiality being 
impeded by some contrary act from issuing in the actuality of the 
form.<A HREF="gc3_12b.htm">*</a>  Good therefore is diminished by evil 
rather by the planting of evil, its contrary, than by the taking off of 
any portion of good.  And this agrees with what has been already said 
about evil: for we said that evil happens beside the intention of the 
doer, who always intends some good, and upon the good intended there 
follows the exclusion of some other good opposite to that good.  The 
greater then the multiplication of that good, upon which, contrary to 
the intention of the agent, evil follows, the greater the diminution of 
potentiality in respect of the opposite good; and so all the more may 
good be said to be diminished by evil.  This diminution however of good 
by evil in the physical world cannot go on indefinitely: for all the 
physical forms and powers are limited, and come to some term beyond 
which they cannot go.<A HREF="gc3_12c.htm">*</a>  But in moral matters 
this diminution of good by evil may proceed to infinity: for the 
understanding and the will have no limits to their acts: thus he who 
wills to commit a theft may will it again and commit another, and so to 
infinity.  The further then the will tends towards undue ends, the more 
difficult it becomes for it to return to its proper and due end, as may 
be seen in persons in whom the habit of vice has been induced by a 
custom of sinning.  Thus then by moral evil the good of natural 
aptitude may be diminished without limit: yet it can never be totally 
taken away, but always waits on nature while that remains.
