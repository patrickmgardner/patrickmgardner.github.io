<h1>Of the Sacrament of Matrimony</h1>

THOUGH by the Sacraments men are restored to grace, they are not 
immediately restored to immortality. Since then the faithful people 
needs to be perpetuated to the end of the world, this has to be done by 
generation. Now generation works to many ends: to the perpetuity of the 
species, to the perpetuity of the political commonwealth, and to the 
perpetuity of the Church. Hence it comes to be ruled and guided by 
different powers. As it works to the good of nature in the perpetuity 
of the species, it is guided to that end by nature so inclining; and in 
that respect it is called 'a function of nature.' As it works to social 
and political good, it is subject to the ordinance of the civil law. As 
it works to the good of the Church, it must be subject to Church 
government. But the things that are administered to the people by the 
ministers of the Church, are called Sacraments.<A 
HREF="4_78a.htm">*</a> Matrimony then, as consisting in the union of 
male and female, intending to beget and educate offspring to the 
worship of God, is a Sacrament of the Church. Hence a blessing is 
pronounced upon it by the ministers of the Church. And as in other 
Sacraments something spiritual is prefigured by external acts, so in 
this Sacrament, by the union of male and female, there is figuratively 
represented the union of Christ with His Church, according to the text 
of the Apostle (Eph. v, 32). And because the Sacraments effect what 
they represent (<i>sacramenta efficiunt quod figurant</i>), we must believe 
that grace is bestowed by this Sacrament on persons marrying, to enable 
them to have their part in the union of Christ with His Church; and 
this aid is very necessary for them, that in their application to 
fleshly and carnal things they may not be sepa rated from Christ and 
the Church.<p> 

Now the figure must correspond to the reality which it signifies. But 
the union of Christ with His Church is of one Bridegroom with one Bride 
to be kept for ever. For of the Church it is said: <i>One is my 
beloved, my perfect one</i> (Cant. vi, 8): nor ever shall Christ be 
parted from His Church: for so He says Himself, <i>Lo, I am with you 
even to the end of the world</i> (Matt. xxviii, 20); and so the 
Apostle, <i>We shall be for ever with the Lord</i> (1 Thess. iv, 16). 
Matrimony therefore, as a Sacrament of the Church, must be of one 
husband with one wife, to continue without separation: this is meant by 
the <i>faith</i> (or <i>troth</i>), whereby husband and wife are bound 
to one another. So then there are three goods of matrimony, as it is a 
Sacrament of the Church: <i>offspring</i>, to be reared and educated to 
the worship of God: <i>faith</i>, whereby one husband is tied to one 
wife: and <i>sacramental signification</i> by the indivisible union of 
the matrimonial connexion, making it a sacred sign of the union of 
Christ with His Church. <p>
