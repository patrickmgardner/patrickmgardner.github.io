With the body in health or with the body in sickness? with the 
infantine or with the full-grown body? St Thomas probably would reply, 
'with the full-grown and healthy body,' -- else we should have millions of 
souls maimed, not through any fault of their own. But how can a soul be 
commensurate with a body such as it has not informed for years before 
its final departure, and in many cases has never informed at all? This 
view of the souls of the departed is very difficult: but so is every 
view on the subject. It would make some difference between a woman's 
and a man's soul. Cf. Chap. <A HREF="gc2_73.htm">LXXIII</a>, A. 2 and 3, 
with <A HREF="gc2_73b.htm">note</a>.
