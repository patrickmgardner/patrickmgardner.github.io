<H1>That God knows Base and Mean Things<A HREF="gc1_70a.htm">*</a></h1>

THE stronger an active power is, to the more remote objects does it 
extend its action. But the power of the divine mind in knowing things 
is likened to active power: since the divine mind knows, not by 
receiving aught from things, but rather by pouring its influence upon 
things.  Since then God's mind is of infinite power in understanding 
(Chap.  <A HREF="gc1_43.htm">XLIII</a>), its knowledge must extend to 
the remotest objects. But the degree of nobility or baseness in all 
things is determined by nearness to or distance from God, who is the 
fulness of nobility. Therefore the very vilest things in being are 
known to God on account of the exceeding great power of His 
understanding.<P>

2. Everything that is, in so far as it has place in the category of 
substance or quality, is in actuality: it is some sort of likeness of 
the prime actuality, and is ennobled thereby. Even potential being, 
from its reference to actuality shares in nobility, and so comes to 
have the name of 'being.' It follows that every being, considered in 
itself, is noble; and is only mean and vile in comparison with some 
other being, nobler still. But the noblest creatures are removed from 
God at a distance not less than that which separates the highest in the 
scale of creation from the lowest.  If then the one distance were to 
bar God's knowledge, much more would the other; and the consequence 
would be that God would know nothing beyond Himself.<P> 

3. The good of the order of the universe is nobler than any part of the
universe. If then God knows any other noble nature, most of all must He
know the order of the universe. But this cannot be known without taking
cognisance at once of things nobler and things baser: for in the mutual
distances and relations of these things the order of the universe 
consists.<P>

4. The vileness of the objects of knowledge does not of itself redound 
on to the knower; for it is of the essence of knowledge that the knower 
should contain within himself impressions of the object known according 
to his own mode and manner.  Accidentally however the vileness of the 
objects known may redound upon the knower, either because in knowing 
base and mean things he is withdrawn from the thought of nobler things, 
or because from the consideration of such vile objects he is inclined 
to some undue affections: which cannot be the case with God.<P> 

5. A power is not judged to be small, which extends to small things, 
but only that which is limited to small things. A knowledge therefore 
that ranges alike over things noble and things mean, is not to be 
judged mean; but that knowledge is mean, which ranges only over mean 
things, as is the case with us: for we make different studies of divine 
and of human things, and there is a different science of each.  But 
with God it is not so; for with the same knowledge and the same glance 
He views Himself and all other beings.<P> 

With this agrees what is said of the Divine Wisdom: <i>It findeth place
everywhere on account of its purity, and nothing defiled stealeth in to 
corrupt it</i> (Wisdom vii, 24, 25).
