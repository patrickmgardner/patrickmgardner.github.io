From his references, St Thomas appears to have been more familiar with 
the <i>Timaeus</i> than with any other of Plato's writings. That 
poetic, mystical and obscure dialogue was a special favourite of the
Neoplatonists, from whom St Thomas gathered his knowledge of Plato. The 
passage, <i>Timaeus</i>, 69c-70a describing how "the mortal kind of 
soul," with its two divisions, was allocated in the body by inferior 
deities, after the Supreme Deity had produced the intellect, misled 
early commentators, and after them St Thomas, into the belief that 
Plato supposed three distinct souls in one human body. Plato never 
speaks of 'souls' except in reference to distinct bodies. He speaks of 
'the soul' of man as familiarly as we do. The <A 
HREF="gc1_94a1.htm"><b>nous</b></a> in the head, 
the <b>thumos</b> (St Thomas's <i>pars irascibilis</i>) in the chest, 
and the <b>epithumiai</b> (<i>pars concupiscibilis</i>) in the belly, 
are not three souls, but three varieties of one soul. Cf 
<i>Timaeus</i>, 89e, "three kinds of soul have been put to dwell in us 
in three several places: <i>Tim</i>, 79d "what the soul has of mortal 
and of divine in its being": <i>Republic</i>, 439e, "two kinds being in 
the soul": <i>Rep</i>, 441c, "there are varieties in the soul of each 
individual." In <i>Laws</i>, 863b, he doubts whether the <greek> phymos 
is to be called "an affection or a part of the soul." In the ultimate 
analysis of Plato's meaning nothing more will appear, I believe, than 
the triple division, accepted by Aristotle and St Thomas, of <greek> 
<A HREF="gc1_94a1.htm"><b>nous</b></a>, <b>phumos</b>, 
<b>epithumia</b>, three phases of one soul, the first inorganic 
and spiritual, the two latter organic and involving connexion with the 
body.
