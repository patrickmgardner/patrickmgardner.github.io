<H1>That the Created Intelligence does not comprehend the Divine 
Substance</h1>

THE aforesaid light is a principle of divine knowledge, since by it the 
created intelligence is elevated to see the divine substance. Therefore 
the mode of divine vision must be commensurate with the intensity of the 
aforesaid light. But the aforesaid light falls far short in intensity 
of the brightness of the divine understanding. It is impossible 
therefore for the divine substance to be seen by such light so 
perfectly as the divine understanding sees it. The divine 
understanding sees that substance as perfectly as it is perfectly 
visible: for the truth of the divine substance and the clearness of the 
divine understanding are equal, nay are one. It is impossible 
therefore for created intelligence through the aforesaid light to see 
the divine substance as perfectly as it is perfectly visible. But 
everything that is comprehended by any knowing mind is known by it as 
perfectly as it is knowable. Thus he who knows that a triangle has 
three angles equal to two right angles, taking it as a matter of 
opinion on probable grounds because wise men say so, does not yet 
comprehend that truth: he alone comprehends it, who knows it as matter 
of science, through the medium of a demonstration showing cause. It is 
impossible therefore for any created intelligence to comprehend the 
divine substance.<p> 

2. Finite power cannot compass in its activity an infinite object. But 
the divine substance is infinite in comparison with every created 
intellect, since every created intellect is bounded within the limits 
of a certain species.<p> 

When it is said that the divine substance is seen but not comprehended 
by created intelligence, the meaning is not that something of it is 
seen and something not seen, since the divine substance is absolutely 
simple: what is meant is that it is not seen perfectly so far as it is 
visible. In the same way he who holds a demonstrable conclusion as a 
matter of opinion, is said to know it but not to comprehend it, because 
he does not know it perfectly, that is, scientifically, though there is 
no part of it that he does not know.<A HREF="gc3_55a.htm">*</a><p>
