Rather a wide definition, as it might be taken to include the 
institution of a clergyman to a benefice. It is usually insisted upon, 
as an essential note of a Sacrament, that the corporeal sign must have 
been 'ordained by Christ,' -- <i>ex institutione ipsius Christi</i>, as 
St Thomas himself says (Chap. <A HREF="gc4_56.htm">LVI</a> <i>ad 
fin.</i>) Christ's ordinance may have been more or less indeterminate, 
e.g., the imposition of hands in Ordination, an indeterminate 
prescription afterwards determined by the Church, adding rites and 
formularies, which it would be unsafe now to set aside as unessential 
because not primitive.
