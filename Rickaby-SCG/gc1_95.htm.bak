<H1>That God cannot will Evil</h1>

EVERY act of God is an act of virtue, since Ills virtue is His essence
(Chap. <A HREF="gc1_92.htm">XCII</a>).<p>

2. The will cannot will evil except by some error coming to be in the 
reason, at least in the matter of the particular choice there and then 
made.  For as the object of the will is good, apprehended as such, the 
will cannot tend to evil unless evil be somehow proposed to it as good; 
and that cannot be without error.<A HREF="gc1_95a.htm">*</a>  But in 
the divine cognition there can be no error (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_61.htm">LXI</a>). 

3. God is the sovereign good, admitting no intermixture of evil (Chap.  
<A HREF="gc1_61.htm">LXI</a>). 

4. Evil cannot befall the will except by its being turned away from its 
end.  But the divine will cannot be turned away from its end, being 
unable to will except by willing itself (Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_75.htm">LXXV</a>).  It cannot therefore will evil; and thus 
free will in it is naturally established in good.  This is the meaning 
of the texts: <i>God is faithful and without iniquity</i> (Deut. xxxii, 
4); <i>Thine eyes are clean, O Lord, and thou canst not look upon 
iniquity</i> (Hab. i, 13).
