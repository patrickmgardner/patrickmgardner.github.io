<H1>How Absolute Necessity may have place in Creation</h1>

ALTHOUGH all things depend on the will of God as their first cause,  
and this first cause is not necessitated in its operation except on the  
supposition of its own purpose, not for that however is absolute 
necessity excluded from creation, need we aver that all things are 
contingent.<p>

1. There are things in creation which simply and absolutely must be. 
Those things simply and absolutely must be, in which there is no 
possibility of their not being. Some things are so brought into being 
by God that there is in their nature a potentiality of not being: which 
happens from this, that the matter in them is in potentiality to 
receive another form. Those things then in which either there is no 
matter, or, if there is any, it is not open to receive another form, 
have no potentiality of not being: such things then simply and 
absolutely must be. If it be said that things which are of nothing, 
of themselves tend to nothingness, and thus there is in all creatures a 
potentiality of not being, -- it is manifest that such a conclusion 
does not follow. For things created by God are said to tend to 
nothingness only in the way in which they are from nothing; and that is 
only in respect of the power of the agent who has created them. Thus 
then creatures have no potentiality of not being: but there is in the 
Creator a power of giving them being or of stopping the influx of being 
to them.<A HREF="gc2_30a.htm">*</a><p> 

4. The further a thing is distant from the self-existent, that is, from 
God, the nigher it is to not being; and the nigher it is to God, the 
further it is withdrawn from not being. Those things therefore which 
are nighest to God, and therefore furthest removed from not being, -- 
in order that the hierarchy of being (<i>ordo rerum</i>) may be 
complete, -- must be such as to have in themselves no potentiality of 
not being, or in other words, their being must be absolutely necessary.  
We observe therefore that, considering the universe of creatures as 
they depend on the first principles of all things, we find that they 
depend on the will (of God), -- not as necessarily arising therefrom, 
except by an hypothetical, or consequent necessity, as has been 
explained (Chap. <A HREF="gc2_28.htm">XXVIII</a>). But, compared with 
proximate and created principles,<A HREF="gc2_30b.htm">*</a> we find 
some things having an absolute necessity. There is no absurdity in 
causes being originally brought into being without any necessity, and 
yet, once they are posited in being, having such and such an effect 
necessarily following from them. That such natures were produced by 
God, was voluntary on His part: but that, once established, a certain 
effect proceeds from them, is a matter of absolute necessity.<A 
HREF="gc2_30c.htm">*</a> What belongs to a thing by reason of its 
essential principles, must obtain by absolute necessity in all 
things.<A HREF="gc2_30d.htm">*</a><p>
