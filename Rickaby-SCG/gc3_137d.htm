Celibacy can be justified on mere natural and
rational grounds in this sense, that no cogent reasons
are apparent making it a man's duty under ordinary
circumstances to marry. But celibacy does not amount
to a virtue except when it is embraced on supernatural 
grounds, that is to say, on grounds of faith
and love of God in Christ.<p>

The chapter next translated is the justification of
the vow of obedience.
