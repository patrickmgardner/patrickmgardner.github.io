Does 'nature' mean anything definite and fixed
at all?  Because, if it does not, nothing can be contrary
to nature. Does 'nature' mean merely 'what God
wills?' If so, nothing that God wills can be contrary
to nature. But the question recurs in another form:
'What can God will?  Any fantastic and bizarre combination 
that we choose to name?' Certainly not.
There are then restraints upon God's willing, restraints
in the eternal nature of things, which, in the last 
reduction means God's own nature. His will may be
said to be conditioned by His nature. He is not a
<i>merum arbitrium</i>, an absolute, arbitrary will. Then
there must be something definite and fixed, which
may be called 'nature,' against which God can have
no will.
