Is not the term 'separated from matter' here used in two senses -- (a) 
of a logical separation by abstraction, <b>log&ocirc;</b>; (b) of a 
real separation in nature, <b>phusei</b>?  A tendency of Scholasticism, 
inherited from Neo-Platonism, was to think of Spirit as personified 
Idea or Form.  The <b>eidos</b> took life and became 
<b>daim&ocirc;n</b>. Aristotle's saying means that the universal, as 
such, exists only in mind.  But the departed soul of a bear, if it be 
at all, is not a universal.
