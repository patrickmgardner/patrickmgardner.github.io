<H1>That God is Cause of Sin to no Man</h1>

THOUGH there are some sinners whom God does not convert to
Himself, but leaves them in their sins according to their deserts,
still He does not induce them to sin.<p>

1. Men sin by deviating from God their last end. But as every agent 
acts to its own proper and befitting end, it is impossible for God's 
action to avert any from their ultimate end in God.<p> 

2. Good cannot be the cause of evil, nor God the cause of sin.<p>

3. All the wisdom and goodness of man is derived from the wisdom and 
goodness of God, being a likeness thereof. But it is repugnant to the 
wisdom and goodness of man to make any one to sin: therefore much more 
to divine wisdom and goodness.<p> 

4. A fault always arises from some defect of the proximate agent, not 
from any defect of the prime agent. Thus the fault of limping comes 
from some defect of the shin-bone, not from the locomotor power, from 
which power however is whatever perfection of movement appears in the 
limping. But the proximate agent of human sin is the will. The sinful 
defect then is from the will of man, not from God, who is the prime 
agent, of whom however is whatever point of perfect action appears in the 
act of sin.<A HREF="gc3_163a.htm">*</a><p> 

Hence it is said: <i>Say not, He himself hath led me astray: for he 
hath no use for sinful men: He hath commanded none to do impiously, and 
he hath not given to any man license to sin</i> (Ecclus xv, 12, 21): 
<i>Let none, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God: for God 
tempteth no man to evil</i> (James i, 13).<p> 

Still there are passages of Scripture, from which it might seem that 
God is to some men the cause of sin. Thus it is said: <i>I have 
hardened the heart of Pharaoh and his servants</i> (Exod. x, 1): 
<i>Blind the heart of this people, and make its ears dull, and close 
its eyes, lest perchance it see with its eyes, and be converted, and I 
heal it: Thou hast made us wander from thy ways: Thou hast hardened our 
heart, that we should not fear thee</i> (Isai. vi, 10: lxiii, 17):  
<i>God delivered them over to a reprobate sense, to do those things 
which are not seemly</i> (Rom. i, 28). All these passages are to be 
understood as meaning that God does not bestow on some the help for 
avoiding sin which He bestows on others. This help is not merely the 
infusion of grace, but also an exterior guardianship, whereby the 
occasions of sin are providentially removed from a man's path. God also 
aids man against sin by the natural light of reason, and other natural 
goods that He bestows on man.<A HREF="gc3_163b.htm">*</a> When then He 
withdraws these aids from some, as their conduct deserves that he 
should, according to the exigency of His justice, He is said to 
<i>harden</i> them, or to <i>blind</i> them.
