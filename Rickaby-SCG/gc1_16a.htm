<i>Potentia passiva</i>, the Aristotelian 'potentiality' in
its opposition to 'act.' Taken actively, the 
word potentia is to be rendered 'Power,' not 'potentiality.'
As God possesses the power to create whatever can
be made at all, there is in Him the promise and 
potency of all possible being.  In Him all things that are
or ever can be exist 'eminently and virtually.' He is
all that they are, but in a better and more excellent
way, -- in some such way as a seal is in regard of all
the impressions that ever can be taken of it, or as a
king in regard of a viceroy or lord-lieutenant: so much
so that actual creation makes no addition to God
or to the sum total of Being absolutely speaking. -- Cf.
Isa. xl.
