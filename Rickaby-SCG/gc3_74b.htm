The example is from Aristotle's three chapter
on chance and fortune (<i>Physics</i>, II, iv, v, vi), the
concluding sentence of which is worth quoting:
"Chance (<b>to automaton</b>) and fortune (<b>h&ecirc; tuch&ecirc;</b>)
something posterior to intelligence and natural 
development: so that however much chance be the 
cause of the system of the heavens, intelligence and
natural development must needs be a prior cause, as
well of many other things, as also of this universe."
