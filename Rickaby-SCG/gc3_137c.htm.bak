He may or may not be acting virtuously, but
at least he is not acting against the cardinal virtue of
temperance, of which chastity is a part. Temperance
is a negative virtue: its sole office is to restrain: it
never urges any one to any gratification of appetite:
"for inclination to the proper objects of any faculties 
does not belong to the habit, but rather is of the
very essence of the said faculties" (<i>Sum. Theol.</i> 1a-2ae
q. 31, art. 1, in corp.) Cf. Arriaga <i>De habitibus et
virtutibus</i>, disp. 36, nn. 4, 5, 6; and <i>Ethics and Natural
Law</i>, pp. 91, 95, ed. 3, a curious and little noticed
point of Ethics.
