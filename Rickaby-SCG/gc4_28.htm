<H1>Of the Error of Photinus concerning the Incarnation</h1>

PHOTINUS and others pretend that the divinity was in Christ, not by 
nature, but by a high degree of participation in divine glory, which He 
had merited by His works. But on this theory it would not be true that 
God had taken flesh so as to become man, but rather that a fleshly man 
had become God. It would not be true that <i>the Word was made 
flesh</i> (John i, 14), but that flesh had been made the Word. 
<i>Kenosis</i> and coming down would not be predicable of the Son of 
God, but rather glorification and being lifted up would be predicated 
of man. It would not be true that, <i>being in the form of God, he 
emptied</i> [<b>eken&ocirc;sen</b>] <i>himself, taking the form of a 
servant</i> (Phil. ii, 6), but only the exaltation of man to divine 
glory would be true, of which presently we read, <i>wherefore hath God 
exalted him</i>. It would not be true, <i>I descended from heaven</i> 
(John vi, 38), but only, <i>I ascend to my Father</i> (John xx, 17): 
notwithstanding that Holy Scripture joins both assertions together: 
<i>None ascendeth into heaven but he who descendeth from heaven, the Son 
of man, who is in heaven</i> (John iii, 13): <i>He who descended, the same 
also ascendeth above all the heavens</i> (Eph. iv, 10). Nor would it be 
true to say of the Son that He was sent by the Father, or that He went 
out from the Father to come into the world, but only that He went to 
the Father, although He Himself makes the two declarations together: 
<i>I go to him who sent me: I went out from the Father, and came into the 
world; and again I leave the world and go unto the Father</i> (John xvi, 5, 
28).
