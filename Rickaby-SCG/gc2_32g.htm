<i>Matter</i> (in motion), <i>time</i>, and <i>place</i> all 
began together. <i>Place</i> (<b>topos</b>) to the schoolmen and 
Aristotle is the shell of <i>space</i> (<b>ch&ocirc;ra</b>) marking the 
outline of a body. If the body were suddenly annihilated, all but the 
indefinitely thin film of its outer surfaces, that film would mark the 
<i>place</i> which the body had occupied. In motion, bodies do not 
carry their <i>place</i> with them, but go from <i>place</i> to 
<i>place</i>. This conception of <i>place</i> is to be borne in mind in 
reading the words that follow immediately in St Thomas.
