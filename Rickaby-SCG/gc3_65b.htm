By way of illustrating the importance of physical 
science to the theologian, I note two propositions
of St Thomas in the fourth argument, here omitted:<p>

(a) "No corporeal thing acts otherwise than
through being in motion." So Aristotle, <i>Physics</i>,
VIII, v.<p>

(b) "It is impossible for the motion of anything
to continue, when the motor action of the moving
cause ceases to be."<p>

The first proposition has not been reconciled with
the laws of gravitation and of electric and magnetic
attraction: the second is a denial of the inertia of
matter. St Thomas took them both from Aristotle.
