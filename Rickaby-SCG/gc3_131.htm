<H1>Of the Counsels that are given in the Divine Law</h1>

BECAUSE the best part for man is to fix his mind on God and divine 
things, and it is impossible for man to busy himself with intense 
ardour in a number of different directions, there are given in the 
divine law counsels for enabling the human mind to take a more free 
flight to God. These counsels withdraw men from the occupations of the 
present life, so far as is possible for men still living on earth. Such 
withdrawal is not so necessary to justice as that justice cannot be 
without it: for virtue and justice is not done away with by man's 
making use of corporeal and earthly things according to the order of 
reason: therefore these admonitions of the divine law are called 
counsels, and not commandments, inasmuch as they advise a man to drop 
things less good for things that are better.<p> 

Human solicitude busies itself about the common measure of human life 
in three chief particulars. First, about one's own person, what one is 
to do or where to live; secondly, about persons related to oneself, 
especially wife and children; thirdly, about the procurement of 
exterior things, needful for the support of life. For cutting off 
solicitude about exterior things there is given in the divine law the 
counsel of poverty, which prompts to the casting away of the things of 
this world. Hence the Lord says: <i>If thou wilt be perfect, go, sell 
what thou hast and give to the poor, and come, follow me</i> (Matt. 
xix, 21). For cutting off solicitude about wife and children there is 
given man the counsel of virginity, or continence. Hence it is said: 
<i>About virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, but I give a 
counsel</i>; and, adding the reason of this counsel, he continues: 
<i>He that is without a wife is solicitous for the things of the Lord, 
how he may please God; but he that is with a wife is solicitous for the 
things of the world, how he may please his wife, and is divided</i> (1 
Cor. vii, 25-33). For cutting off man's solicitude even about himself 
there is given the counsel of obedience, whereby a man commits the 
disposal of his acts to his superior. Therefore it is said: <i>Obey 
your superiors and be subject to them, for they watch as having to 
render an account of your souls</i> (Heb. xiii, 17).<p> 

Because the highest perfection of human life consists in the mind of 
man being detached from other things and fixed on God, and the three 
counsels aforesaid seem singularly to dispose the mind to this 
detachment, we may see in them proper adjuncts of a state of 
perfection, not that they themselves constitute perfection, but 
inasmuch as they are dispositions to perfection, which consists in the 
union of the detached soul with God. This is expressly shown in the 
words of our Lord counselling poverty: <i>If thou wilt be perfect, go, 
sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and follow me</i>, -- where 
He places the perfection of life in the following of Him.<p> 

They may also be called effects and signs of perfection. For when the 
mind is strongly possessed with love and desire of anything, it 
thereupon counts other things as quite secondary: so from man's mind 
being carried with fervent love and desire to divine things, wherein 
its perfection consists, the consequence is a casting off of all that 
might retard its movement to God, -- care of property, affection for wife 
and children, and even love of one's own self. This is signified by the 
words of Scripture: <i>If a man shall give the whole substance of his 
house in exchange for love, he will account it nothing</i> (Cant. viii, 7): 
<i>Having found one precious pearl, he went and sold all that he had, and 
acquired it</i> (Matt. xiii, 46): <i>the advantages that I had I considered 
as dirt, that I might gain Christ</i> (Philip. iii, 8).<p> 

Since then the three counsels aforesaid are dispositions to perfection, 
and effects of perfection, and signs of the same, they who make the 
three corresponding vows to God are properly said to be in a state of 
perfection. The perfection to which they dispose the mind consists in 
the free converse of the soul with God. Hence they who make profession 
of the aforesaid vows are called 'religious,' as dedicating themselves 
and all that is theirs to God by a manner of sacrifice, extending to 
property by poverty, to the body by continence, and to the will by 
obedience: for religion consists in the worship of God (Chap. <A
