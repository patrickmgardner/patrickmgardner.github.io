Abu Walid Mohammed Ibn Roschd (Averroes), called by the schoolmen 'the 
Commentator,' as Aristotle was 'the Philosopher,' was born at Cordova 
in 1120, and died in Morocco, 1198. He practised as a physician and a 
lawyer, and had a place about court, but was above all things a 
philosopher and an uncompromising Aristotelian. Fallen into neglect 
among his own countrymen, his philosophy embroiled the schools of 
Western Europe for four centuries, 1230-1630, at Paris, at Oxford, but 
particularly at Padua. Numerous Latin editions were printed. I shall 
cite the Venice edition of 1574 in the Bodleian Library, ten 
volumes.<p> 

The origin of this dispute about the intellect is to be found in a 
passage of Plato, <i>Theatetus</i>, 185: "Being and not-being, likeness 
and unlikeness, sameness and difference, number . . . . there is no 
bodily organ for the cognition of these entities, but the soul by 
herself regards them; so it appears that the soul regards some things 
by herself, and other things through the bodily faculties." This 
passage is the foreshadowing of the celebrated and much disputed 
chapters, <i>De anima</i>, III, iv, v. Two words there call for notice: 
(1) <b>apathes</b>, meaning <i>unimpressed</i>, at first hand, by 
matter; (2) <b>ch&ocirc;ristos</b>, <i>separable</i>, or <i>separate</i>, on 
which word the great contention turns. It may apply to the 'active,' or 
to the 'potential' intellect: but it matters not to which, for Averroes 
and St Thomas agree that the two go together. It may refer to the state 
after death, and signify that the intellectual soul is not destroyed by 
separation from the body: on this point again there is a general 
agreement between Averroes and St Thomas. The battle between them 
begins when the word is referred to the intellect as it is in this 
mortal life. St Thomas takes the term merely to mean 'capable of 
operating apart from any bodily organ,' -- according to the tenor of 
the passage above quoted from Plato. Averroes will have it that it 
means, not only that, but much more than that: the meaning being 
according to him, that even while we live on earth, our intellect, 
'potential' and 'active,' is outside of us, and is one and the same 
numerically for all men.<p>
 
My reading of Averroes has not revealed to me where he places this one 
separate universal intellect. He does not make it to be God: thus he 
says in his <i>Destructio destructionum</i> (or Refutation of the 
Refutations of Algazel): "If man only understood this, then his 
intellect would be the intellect of the God of glory; and that is 
false" (disp. 6, p. 87b). The notion of his day, in which he shared, 
that the heavenly bodies have souls, might have tempted him to place 
<b>nous ch&ocirc;ristos</b> in some heavenly sphere: that doctrine however 
belongs to the disciples of Averroes, not to the master. Renan, 
<i>Averroes et l'Averroisme</i>, p. 138, gives this explanation: Une 
hurnanit&eacute; vivante et permanente, tel semble donc &ecirc;tre le 
sens de la th&eacute;orie Averroistique de l'unit&eacute; de 
l'intellect. L'immortalit&eacute; de l'intellect actif [and of the 
potential intellect with it, on which Averroes chiefly insists] n'est 
ainsi autre chose que, la renaissance &eacute;ternelle de 
l'humanit&eacute;, et la perpetuit&eacute; de la civilisation. This 
interpretation derives support from Averroes's comments on  the <i>De 
anima</i>, III (pp. 149-151). Holding as he did the eternity of the 
world, he tells us there that the human race is eternal, and that some 
portion of the human race is always civilised, --positions set aside by 
our astronomy and geology, and at variance with the received 
anthropology. He says: "There must always be some philosopher amongst 
mankind." I have some hesitation however in agreeing with Renan's 
explanation: because this position, which he attributes to Averroes, is 
clearly suicidal, and the Commentator was no fool. If no individual man 
had a head on his shoulders, the race would be headless. Averroes (see 
Chap. LX) does not seem to allow to the individual man, as man, any 
higher faculty than a faculty proper to the sentient soul: how can a 
race of such sentient beings constitute an intelligence? The 
intelligence of the race can only mean the intelligence of this man and 
of that, combining to form society. But it is difficult to form any 
rational conception of <b>nous ch&ocirc;ristos</b> as Averroes understood it. 
If Renan 's interpretation be taken, then when Averroes speaks (<i>De 
anima</i>, III, p. 161) of the "active and potential intellect" as 
being "eternal substances," we must understand him to call them eternal 
with the eternity of civilised mankind, an eternity which he positively 
asserts (<i>De anima</i>, p. 149).<p> 

The main point of St Thomas's attack upon the Commentator is his theory 
of the <i>continuatio</i> (<i>ittis&acirc;l</i> is the Arabic name, 
much used by the Arabian mystics), or point of contact between the 
universal intelligence outside and the mind of the individual man. 
Averroes's words are these (<i>De anima</i>, II, pp. 178, 148b, 185b): 
"The potential intellect is not conjoined with us primarily and 
ordinarily: nay, it is not conjoined with us at all, except inasmuch as 
it is conjoined with the forms in our phantasy. . . . Since it has been 
shown that intellect cannot be conjoined with all men so as to be 
multiplied as they are multiplied, it remains that the said intellect 
is conjoined with us by conjunction with our intellectual impressions 
which are conceptions in the phantasy, that is to say, through that 
part of those conceptions which exists in us and serves in a manner as 
a form. . . . Since the impressions of speculative intellect are 
conjoined with us by forms of phantasy; and the active intellect is 
conjoined with those intellectual impressions; and the intellect which 
takes cognisance of those impressions, that is to say, the potential 
intellect, is the same [as the active]: the necessary conclusion is 
that the active intellect is conjoined with us by the conjunction of 
those intellectual impressions." See St Thomas, <i>Summa Theol.</i> I, 
q 76 artt. 1 and 2: where he explains Averroes thus: "The Commentator 
says that this union is by means of the intellectual impression, which 
has a twofold residence, one in the potential intellect [universal, 
eternal, independent of the individual], and another in the impressions 
of phantasy, which are in the bodily organs [of the individual; in his 
phantasy, or sensory memory, or in the <i>vis cogitativa</i>, an 
organic faculty allied to phantasy]. And thus, through this 
intellectual impression, the potential intellect is continued and 
conjoined with the body of the individual man" (art. 1). St Thomas 
criticises this theory as follows (art. 2): "So long as the intellect 
is one, however all other things are diversified which the intellect 
uses as instruments, in no way can Socrates and Plato be called other 
than one intelligent being. . . . I grant that if the phantasm, or 
impression in the phantasy, inasmuch as it is other and other in you 
and me, were a form (or idea) of the potential intellect, then your 
intellectual activity and mine might be differentiated by the diversity 
of phantasms . . . . but the said phantasm is not a form (or idea) of 
the potential intellect: an idea in the potential intellect is obtained 
only by abstraction from phantasms. If then there were but one 
intellect for all men, no diversities of phantasms in this man and that 
could ever cause a diversity of intellectual activity between one man 
and another, as the Commentator pretends."<p> 

So far as the Averroistic Potential (and Active) Intellect can be 
identified with the <i>Zeitgeist</i> or Educated Opinion of the day, 
and adapted to Comte's theory of progress, the reader will find some 
discussion of it in my <i>Oxford and Cambridge Conferences</i>, First 
Series, pp. 135 sq.; also <i>Political and Moral Essays</i>, p. 132, 
note.<p> 

On <i>De anima</i>, III, the Commentator (p. 149) specifies three kinds 
of intellect: "the <i>potential</i> intellect, the <i>active</i> 
intellect, the <i>acquired</i> or <i>made</i> intellect: of these 
three, two are eternal, the active and the potential: the third is 
partly producible and perishable, and partly eternal." By the 'acquired 
intellect' he appears to mean the 'passive intellect' of each 
individual, inasmuch as it is illumined by <i>continuatio</i> 
(<i>ittis&acirc;l</i>) with the universal potential intellect. Does that
mean the mind of the individual in so far as it comes abreast of the 
<i>Zeitgeist</i>? If so, but I cannot feel sure of the conclusion, then 
Arabian mysticism ends in positivism.
