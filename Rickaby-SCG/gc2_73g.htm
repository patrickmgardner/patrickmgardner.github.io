"The middle cell of the head," according to Averroes in Chap. 
<a href="gc2_60.htm">LX</a>. If any one will have it that the grey 
matter of the brain is the organ even of intelligence itself, the 
scholastic reply is: 'Of intelligence as needing the concurrence of 
phantasms, yes: of intelligence pure and simple, exactly the <b>nous 
ch&ocirc;ristos</b>, no.' The difficulty remains, that precisely over 
the most abstract thinking, where the thinker does his utmost to 
dispense with phantasms, does the grey matter of the brain get most 
exhausted. Perhaps the effort to dispense with phantasms does violence 
to the phantasy, and thereby consumes the tissue which ministers to 
that sentient faculty.
