<i>Metaphysica, quae circa divina versatur</i>, answers 
pretty well to what is now called natural theology. 
In the order of sciences, then, natural theology comes 
last in philosophy, and presupposes a knowledge of
all the rest.  Ethics therefore do not presuppose
natural theology, but are presupposed by it. It follows
that ethical conclusions should be first reached by
ethical reasonings, not by theological. This point is
further explained in my <i>Ethics and Natural Law</i>,
pp. 123-125.
