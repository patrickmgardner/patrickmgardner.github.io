"What is in potentiality to life is not the [dead body], which has 
parted with its soul (<b>to apobebl&ecirc;kos t&ecirc;n 
psuch&ecirc;n</b>), but that [living body] which retains it: as for the 
seed and fruit, it is potentially the particular body [into which it 
will develope]," <i>De anima</i>, II, i. St Thomas's explanation of 
<b>to apobebl&ecirc;kos</b> is ingenious but mistaken.
