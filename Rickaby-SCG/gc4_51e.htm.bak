Of God and His Creatures</a><hr><p> The difficulty of this interesting 
passage is its seeming to place original sin in the privation of 
original justice, as above defined: whereas baptism, cleansing as it 
does from original sin, does not impart original justice, but 
sanctifying grace. Original sin is the privation of sanctifying grace, 
under the explanations given in note, p. 379. God's sentence upon Adam 
has worked like an attainder upon a nobleman guilty of treason. The 
title is taken away from the family. We are by nature and birth a 
family of commoners, and worse than commoners, for we ought to be 
noble, and are not, because of the brand of treason resting upon our 
race. So we are <b>tekna phusei org&ecirc;s</b> (Eph. ii, 3): we are born 
in disgrace with God. Our nobility comes with our baptism, and consists 
in the sanctifying grace given in that Sacrament; not in 'original 
justice,' which shall not be restored to our race till the day of the 
resurrection of the just.<p>

There is no difficulty in the text of Ezechiel, which refers to the 
sins of the people to whom the prophet was sent; and describes the 
providence of God, not over Adam, but over his posterity.
