To say that in man nature attains its highest
perfection, that there is nothing beyond nature, and
consequently nothing in existence higher than man,
is atheism. To make out a God, all intellect and no
will, all law and no love, a being admirable indeed,
but unloving and unlovable, is to make God less good
than man, -- as though what Holy Writ calls 'lovingkindness' 
were a sort of 'bend sinister,' a shade of
inferiority in being. The argument in the text, -- by
adversaries dubbed 'anthropomorphic,' -- goes to establish 
what present-day philosophers call 'a personal
God,' meaning a God who has in Him something 
corresponding to what in man are called 'feelings,' and
that something not ineffective or impotent in this
world of law; a God consequently whom there is
some use in praying to.<p>
