<H1>That God governs things by His Providence</h1>

THE foregoing conclusions sufficiently show that God is the end of all 
things. Hence it may be further gathered that by His providence He 
governs and rules all things. For whatever things are referred to an 
end, are all subject to His management to whom principally that end 
belongs, as appears in an army: for all the components of the army and 
all their works are referred to one last end, the good of the general, 
which is victory, and therefore it belongs to the general to govern the 
whole army. In like manner the art which is concerned with the end 
gives commands and laws to the art which is concerned with the means, 
as politics to the art of war, the art of war to the management of 
cavalry, navigation to shipbuilding. Since therefore all things are 
referred to an end, which is the divine goodness (Chapp. <A 
HREF="gc3_17.htm">XVII</a>, <A HREF="gc3_18.htm">XVIII</a>), 
God, to whom that goodness principally belongs, -- as being His own 
substance, possessed, understood, and loved, -- must have the chief 
control of all things.<p> 

5. Things that are distinct in their natures do not combine into one 
system, unless they be bound up in one by one directing control (<i>ab uno 
ordinante</i>). But in the universe there are things, having distinct and 
contrary natures, which nevertheless all combine in one system, some 
things taking up the activities of other things, some things being 
aided or even wrought by others. There must then be one ordainer and 
governor of the universe.<p> 

8. Every agent that intends an end cares more for that which is nearer 
to the last end. But the last end of the divine will is the divine 
goodness, and the nearest thing to that in creation is the goodness of 
the order of the entire universe, that being the end to which every 
particular good of this or that thing is referred, as the less perfect 
is referred to the more perfect, and every part is for its whole. What 
therefore God most cares for in creation is the order of the 
universe:<A HREF="gc3_64a.htm">*</a> He is therefore its controller.<p> 

Hence Holy Scripture ascribes the course of events to the divine 
command: <i>Who giveth command to the sun, and it riseth not, and 
encloseth the stars as under a seal</i> (Job ix, 7): <i>He hath given a 
command, and it shall not pass away</i> (Ps. cxlviii, 6).
