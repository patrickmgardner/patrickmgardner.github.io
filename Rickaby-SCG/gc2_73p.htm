This latter process, in which the phantasm is called up at the beck of 
the already informed intellect, is what Wordsworth calls "imagination," 
and the faculty of accomplishing this process is the faculty of 
"imagination," a faculty intellectual rather than one of sense, because 
it means intellect leading and phantasy serving. Therefore the 
Aristotelian <b>phantasia</b> (described in <i>De anima</i>, III, iii, 
9 sq.), called by St Thomas <i>imaginatio</i>, I have chosen to render 
by the old word phantasy. It is a faculty of the sentient nature, and 
therefore not imagination in the Wordsworthian sense. The word 
<i>fancy</i> has other meanings, inappropriate in this connexion.
