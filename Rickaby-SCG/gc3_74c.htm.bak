Aristotle is right in contending that things do
happen by fortune and chance; and further that 
fortune and chance are relative terms, denoting the
unforeseen and unpremeditated in relation to (human)
forethought. But in relation to a perfect providence,
an all-seeing mind, an omnipotent ruler, nothing is
fortuitous: everything is foreseen, allowed for, willed,
or at least permitted. Nor are the laws of nature at
fault in a chance event. The same forces, working
according to the same laws, forward man to his
destination nine hundred and ninety-nine times, and
the thousandth time they destroy him.
