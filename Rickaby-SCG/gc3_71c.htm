This perhaps is the best account that we have
to render of evil. Evil lies at the root of things 
creatable, limited and imperfect: it is imbedded in the
eternal possibilities of their nature: let but things
exist in time, and certain evils, physical evils at any
rate, are bound to arise. And given a realm of rational
creatures, subject to physical evils, moral evils are not
far off the frontier of such a kingdom.
