<h1>Of the Distinction of Orders</h1>

SINCE the power of Order is principally directed to the consecration of 
the Body of Christ, and its administration to the faithful, and the 
cleansing of the faithful from sin, there must be some chief Order, the 
power of which extends chiefly to these objects; and that is the Order 
of Priesthood. There must be other Orders to serve the chief Order by 
one way or another preparing its matter; and these are the Orders of 
Ministers. The power of Priesthood extending to two objects, the 
consecration of the Body of Christ, and the rendering the faithful by 
absolution from sin fit to receive the Eucharist, the lower Orders must 
serve the Priesthood either in both or in one of these respects. The 
lower Orders serve the Priesthood only in preparing the people [for the 
Eucharist]. This the Doorkeepers do by shutting out unbelievers from 
the company of the faithful: the Lectors by instructing the catechumens 
in the rudiments of the faith, -- hence the Scripture of the Old 
Testament is committed to their reading: the Exorcists by cleansing 
those who are already instructed, if in any way they are hindered by 
the devil from the reception of the Sacraments.<A 
HREF="gc4_75a.htm">*</a> The higher Orders serve the priestly Order 
both in the preparation of the people and in the consummation of the 
Sacrament. Thus the Acolytes have a ministry to exercise over the 
vessels, other than sacred, in which the matter of the Sacrament is 
prepared: hence the altar-cruets are delivered to them at their 
ordination. The Subdeacons have a ministry to exercise over the sacred 
vessels, and over the arrangement of the matter not yet consecrated. 
The Deacons have a further ministry over the matter already 
consecrated, as the deacon administers the Blood of Christ to the 
faithful. These three Orders of Priests, Deacons and Subdeacons, are 
called Sacred Orders, because they receive a ministry over sacred 
things.<A HREF="gc4_75b.htm">*</a> The higher Orders also serve for the 
preparation of the people: for to Deacons is committed the publishing 
of the doctrine of the Gospel to the people: to Subdeacons that of the 
Apostles: while Acolytes render to both the attendance which conduces 
to solemnity of teaching, by carrying candles and otherwise serving.
