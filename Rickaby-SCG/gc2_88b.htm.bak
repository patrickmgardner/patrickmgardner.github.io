In calling this opinion 'false,' St Thomas can never have meant to deny 
the intimate connexion of the vital acts of the embryo with those of 
the mother, so that separation from the mother at an early stage by 
abortion or miscarriage is death. He means only that the mother is not 
everything, -- that the embryo has vital acts of its own, though not 
independent acts; that the embryo lives and developes, which it could 
not do without a distinct vegetative soul to animate it. But when he 
presently goes on to attribute operations of sense to the embryo, and 
says that it feels, -- speaking of the embryo <i>ante ultimum 
complementum</i>, -- he outruns all probability. Feeling supposes an 
advanced development of the nervous system. It is impossible to 
believe that the merely cellular embryo, with only a potential nervous 
system, can feel.
