<H1>Arguments against the aforesaid statements, and their 
Solutions</h1> 

ARG. 1. No access of light to the eye can elevate the sight to see 
things that transcend the natural faculty of bodily vision. But the 
divine substance transcends the entire capacity of created 
intelligence, even more than intellect transcends the capacity of 
sense. Therefore no light can supervene upon any created intelligence, 
to elevate it to the capacity of seeing the divine substance.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. The divine substance is not beyond the capacity of created 
intelligence as though it were something altogether alien from it, as 
sound is alien from sight, or an immaterial substance from sense, -- for 
the divine substance is the prime object of intelligence, and the 
beginning of all intellectual knowledge, -- but it is beyond the capacity 
of created intelligence as exceeding its power, as the more excellent 
sensible objects are beyond the capacity of sense.<A 
HREF="gc3_54a.htm">*</a><p> 

<i>Arg. 2</i>. That light which is received in the created intelligence is 
itself created, and therefore falling infinitely short of God. 
Therefore no such light can raise the creature to the vision of the 
divine substance.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. This light raises the creature to the vision of God, not that 
there is no interval between it and the divine substance, but it does 
so in virtue of the power which it receives from God to such effect, 
although in its own being it falls infinitely short of God. For this 
created light does not conjoin the intelligence with God in point of 
being, but only in point of understanding.<A HREF="gc3_54b.htm">*</a><p> 

<i>Arg. 4</i>. What is created, may very well be connatural with some created 
thing. If then that light is created, there may be some created 
intelligence, which by its own connatural light will see the divine 
substance, contrary to what has been shown (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_41.htm">
XLII</a>).<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. The vision of the divine substance exceeds all natural faculty: 
hence the light whereby a created intelligence is perfected to the 
vision of the divine substance must be supernatural.<p> 

<i>Arg. 6</i>. There must be proportion between the intelligence and the thing 
understood. But there is no proportion between a created intelligence, 
perfected in the aforesaid light, and the divine substance, since the 
distance between them still remains infinite.<p> 

<i>Reply</i>. So there is a proportion between a created intelligence 
and God as an object of understanding, not a proportion implying any 
commensurateness of being, but a proportion implying a reference of one 
to the other, as matter is referred to form, or cause to effect. Thus 
there may well be a proportion between the creature and God, as the 
understanding is referred to the understood, or the effect to the 
cause.<A HREF="gc3_54c.htm">*</a><p> 

Some have been moved by these and the like arguments to lay down the 
statement that God is never to be seen by any created intelligence. But 
this position, besides taking away the true happiness of the rational 
creature, which cannot be except in the vision of the divine substance, 
as has been shown (Chap. <A HREF="gc3_51.htm">LI</a>), is also in 
contradiction with the authority of Holy Scripture, and is to be 
rejected as false and heretical.<A HREF="gc3_54d.htm">*</a><p>
