From the following chapter (XIII) it appears that we not only know God 
in His relations to us of Creator, Lord, etc., relations which in Him 
are conceptual, not real; but also to some extent in His absolute 
attributes of omnipotence, wisdom, goodness, intelligence and will, 
attributes which are realities in God, and are by us imperfectly 
apprehended as such.
