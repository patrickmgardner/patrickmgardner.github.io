The fourth property is usually called 'subtlety'.
St Thomas does not use the name, but indicates what
is meant by it in the next chapter (Chap. LXXXVI),
where he assigns as the "place of glorified bodies"
the region <i>above all the heavens</i> (Eph. iv, 10), by
which he understands the solid crystal spheres which
carry the stars. Then to the difficulty, "that these
heavenly spheres cannot be broken, for the glorified
bodies to rise above them," he answers: "The glorified 
bodies will be compenetrable with other bodies,
of which we have evidence in the Body of Christ,
which came in to the disciples <i>when the doors were
shut</i>" (John xx, 19). This is the property of 'subtle
ty,' whereby a glorified body passes through 
obstacles with the freedom of a spirit.<p>

Is the heaven of glorified bodies in some remote
star? Or is it in some unknown dimensions of space?
There is a mystery in that <i>cloud</i> which <i>received him
out of their sight</i> (Acts i, 9); and in those <i>clouds of
heaven</i> in which <i>he shall come again</i> (Matt. xxvi, 64: 
Acts i, 11).
