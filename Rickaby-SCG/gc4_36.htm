<H1>Of the Error of Macarius of Antioch, who posited one Operation only 
and one Will only in Christ<A HREF="gc4_36a.htm">*</a></h1> 

TO every nature there is a proper activity: for the form is the 
principle of activity, and different natures have different forms and 
different acts. If then in Christ there is only one operation, there 
must be in Him only one nature: but to hold that is the Eutychian 
heresy.<p> 

2. There is in Christ a perfect divine nature, whereby He is 
consubstantial with the Father; and a perfect human nature, whereby He 
is of one species with us. But it is part of the perfection of the 
divine nature to have a will (B. I, Chap. <A 
HREF="gc1_72.htm">LXXII</a>); and part of the perfection of human 
nature to have a will, whereby a man is capable of free choice. There 
must therefore be two wills in Christ.<p> 

3. If in Christ there is no other will than the will of the Word, by parity
of reasoning there can be in Him no understanding but the understanding
of the Word: thus we are brought back to the position of Apollinaris
(Chap. <A HREF="gc4_32.htm">XXXII</a>).<p>

4. If there was only one will in Christ, that must have been the divine 
will: for the Word could not have lost the divine will, which he had 
from eternity. But it does not belong to the divine will to merit. Thus 
then Christ would have merited neither for Himself nor for us by His 
passion, contrary to the teaching of the Apostle: <i>He was made obedient 
unto death, therefore hath God exalted him</i> (Phil. ii, 8, 9).<p> 

 6. In one ordinary man, though he be one in person, there are 
nevertheless several appetites and operations according to different 
natural principles. In his rational part there is in him will: in his 
sensible part there is in him an irascible [<b>thumos</b>] and a 
concupiscible appetite [<b>epithum&ecirc;tikon</b>]: and again there is 
physical tendency following upon physical powers.<A 
HREF="gc4_36b.htm">*</a> In like manner he sees with the eye, hears 
with the ear, walks with the foot, speaks with the tongue, and 
understands with the mind, all so many different activities. And the 
reason is, because activities are not only multiplied according to 
difference of active subjects, but also according to the difference of 
the principles whereby one and the same subject works, from which 
principles also the activities derive their species. But the divine 
activity differs much more from the human than the natural principles 
of human nature from one another. There is therefore a difference of 
will and a difference of operation between the divine and the human 
nature in Christ, although Christ Himself is one in both natures.<p> 

7. The authority of Scripture shows plainly two wills in Christ: <i>Not 
to do my will, but the will of Him that sent me</i> (John vi, 38): 
<i>Not my will but thine be done</i> (Luke xxii, 42). These texts show 
that Christ had a will of His own, besides the will of His Father. On 
the other hand there was a will common to Him with the Father: for 
Father and Son have one will, as they have one nature. There are then 
in Christ two wills.<p> 

8. And in like manner of operations, or activities, -- there was in 
Christ one operation common to Him with the Father, of which He says: 
<i>Whatsoever things the Father doeth, the same the Son doeth also</i> 
(John v, 19); and there was in Him another operation which attached 
not to the Father, as sleeping, hungering, eating, and the like things 
that Christ did or suffered in His humanity, as the Evangelists record 
(Mark iv, 38; xi, 12; ii, 16).<p> 

Monothelism appears to have sprung from the inability of its authors to 
distinguish between what is absolutely one and what is one in 
subordination to another. They saw that the human will in Christ was 
altogether subordinate to the divine will, so that Christ willed 
nothing with His human will otherwise than as the divine will 
predisposed Him to will.<A HREF="gc4_36c.htm">*</a> In like manner 
Christ wrought nothing in His human nature either in doing or in 
suffering, except what the divine will arranged, according to the text, 
<i>I do ever the things that are pleasing to him</i> (John viii, 29). The 
human operation of Christ gained a divine efficacy by His union with 
the Divinity, in consequence of which everything that He did or 
suffered made for salvation: wherefore Dionysius calls the human 
activity of Christ 'theandric.' Seeing then that the human will and 
operation of Christ was subordinate to the divine, with a subordination 
that never failed, they [the Monothelites] judged that there was only 
one will and operation in Christ; although it is not the same thing to 
be one by subordination and one absolutely.<A HREF="gc4_36d.htm">*</a>
