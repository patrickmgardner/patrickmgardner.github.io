<H1>How the Arrangements of Providence follow a Plan</h1>

GOD by His providence directs all things to the end of the divine 
goodness, not that anything accrues as an addition to His goodness by 
the things that He makes, but His aim is the impression of the likeness 
of His goodness so far as possible on creation. But inasmuch as every 
created substance must fall short of the perfection of the divine 
goodness, it was needful to have diversity in things for the more 
perfect communication of the divine goodness, that what cannot 
perfectly be represented by one created exemplar, might be represented 
by divers such exemplars in divers ways in a more perfect manner. Thus 
man multiplies his words to express by divers expressions the 
conception of his mind, which cannot all be put in one word.<A 
HREF="gc3_97a.htm">*</a> And herein we may consider the excellence of 
the divine perfection shown in this, that the perfect goodness which is 
in God united and simple, cannot be in creatures except according to 
diversity of modes and in many subjects. Things are different by having 
different forms, whence they take their species. Thus then the end of 
creation furnishes a reason for the diversity of forms in things.<p> 

From the diversity of forms follows a difference of activities, and 
further a diversity of agents and patients, properties and accidents. 
<p> 

Evidently then it is not without reason that divine providence 
distributes to creatures different accidents and actions and impressions 
and allocations. Hence it is said: <i>The Lord by wisdom hath founded the 
earth, hath established the heavens in prudence. By his wisdom the 
depths have broken out, and the clouds grow thick with dew</i> (Prov. iii, 
19, 20).<p> 

As it is necessary for one wishing to build a house to look out for 
timber, but his looking out for pitch-pine (<i>ligna abietina</i>) 
depends on his mere will, not on his plan of building a house; so it is 
necessary for God to love His own goodness, but it does not thence 
necessarily follow that He should wish to have that goodness 
represented by creatures, since the divine goodness is perfect without 
that. Hence the bringing of creatures into being depends on the mere 
will of God, although it is done in consideration of the divine 
goodness. Supposing however that God wishes to communicate His goodness 
by way of similitude as far as possible, it logically follows thence 
that there should be creatures of different sorts: but it does not 
follow of necessity that creatures should be of <i>this</i> or 
<i>that</i> grade of perfection, or exist in <i>this</i> or <i>that</i> 
number. But supposing that it is in the divine will to wish <i>this</i> 
number in creation, and <i>this</i> grade of perfection in each 
creature, it thence follows logically that creation be in such and such 
form, and such and such matter; and so of further consequences. 
Manifestly then providence disposes of things according to a certain 
plan, and yet this plan presupposes the divine will.<p> 

What has been said shuts out two errors, the error of those who believe 
that all things follow mere will without reason, which is the error of 
sundry Doctors of the Mohammedan law, as Rabbi Moses says; according to 
whose teaching, the only difference between fire warming and fire 
freezing is God's so willing the former alternative;<A 
HREF="gc3_97b.htm">*</a> and again the error is shut out of those who 
say that the order of causes springs from divine providence by way of 
necessity.<p> 

There are certain words of Holy Scripture which appear to put down all 
things to the mere will of God. Their meaning is not to take away all 
rational character from the dispensations of Providence, but to show 
that the will of God is the first principle of all things. Such texts 
are: <i>All things, whatsoever he hath willed, the Lord hath done</i> 
(Ps. cxxxiv, 6:)  <i>Who can say to him, Why doth thou so?</i> (Job ix, 
12:)  <i>Who resisteth his will?</i>  (Rom. ix, 19.)  And Augustine 
(<i> De Trin.</i> III:) "Nothing but the will of God is the prime cause 
of health and sickness, of rewards and punishments, of graces and 
recompenses."<p> 

Thus in answer to the question, <i>Why?</i> asked of any natural 
effect, we can render a reason from some proximate cause, yet so that 
we reduce all things to the prime cause. Thus if it is asked why wood 
gets hot in presence of fire, it is answered [etc., etc., in terms of 
Aristotelian physics], and so on till we come to the will of God [who 
willed to create matter and energy, such as we know them, from the 
beginning]. Hence whoever answers the question, why the wood got hot, 
Because God has willed it so, answers appropriately, if he intends to 
carry back the question to the prime cause; but inappropriately, if he 
intends to exclude all other causes.<A HREF="gc3_97c.htm">*</a><p>
