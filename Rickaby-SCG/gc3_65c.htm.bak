<i>Insunt ut in via ad naturam</i>, as one might say of
an undergraduate <i>inest ut in via ad gradum</i>. "A
<i>habit</i> is a quality <i>difficult to change</i>, whereby an agent,
whose nature it was to work one way or another
indeterminately, is disposed easily and readily at will
to follow this or that particular line of action. <i>Habit</i>
differs from disposition, as disposition is a quality easily
changed. Thus one in a good humour is in a disposition
to be kind. Habit is a part of character: disposition is
a passing fit" (<i>Ethics and Natural Law</i>, p. 64). 
Unfortunately, the word disposition in English is used to
signify natural or congenital character, the Latin
<i>indoles</i>. We might perhaps say mood. But the plural,
good dispositions, expresses St Thomas's <i>dispositio</i>.
