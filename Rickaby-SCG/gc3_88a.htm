In Chapp. LXXXII-LXXXVII St Thomas
argues that the heavenly bodies, which he says are
"perfect without blending of contraries, being neither
light nor heavy, nor hot nor cold," are the instruments 
whereby God prompts and controls all movement 
and change in material bodies on earth: that
nevertheless they exercise no direct action upon the
human understanding, which is something nobler
than they, as the incorporeal is nobler than the 
incorporeal: nor are they arbiters of human will and
conduct, except remotely and by occasion, as they
affect the human body, under which affection the
will makes its free choice: nor do they even determine 
the course of other terrestrial events absolutely,
since much depends upon the condition and capacities 
of terrestrial physical causes.<p>

Repeatedly in this work St Thomas shows his
grievous misgivings as to the later Platonic position,
that stars are animals and heavenly spheres have souls.
He considered that the stars and their containing
spheres, if they were not themselves animate, were
moved by angels, which is another thing. Cf. Plato
<i>Rep.</i> X, 616 C, sq.
