<P>1. A  DESCRIPTION of certitude in general has now been given; and 
it might be supposed that next, each of the several faculties concerned 
in the production of certitude would be taken separately, and shown to 
be a valid instrument of knowledge.  This would fairly stand as the 
special treatment of the subject.  But it is convenient to leave alone 
the question as to how many faculties there are, and how to divide 
them; for a more serviceable method suggests itself.  If it be 
established successively, that our sensations, our ideas, our 
consciousness of self and its affections, our memory, and our belief in 
the testimony of others, are all, in their own nature, means for 
putting us in possession of certitude, whatever may be their liability 
to occasional, accidental error; then, without any list of faculties, 
enough will be done to satisfy any reasonable requirements on the part 
of those who ask a detailed justification of our claim to real 
knowledge.  Here is our work in this Second Part.</P> 

<P>2. Before proceeding to the task proposed, it is quite necessary to 
make explicit statement of some doctrines about substance and efficient 
causality, doctrines lying at the very root of any theory of knowledge, 
yet doctrines which do not belong to this treatise, but to that on 
General Metaphysics. Here, however, a brief declaration is almost 
imperative, in this country where Hume has such an influence.</P> 

<P>(a) The notion of substance, which scholasticism upholds, is not 
what the school of Hume is apt to fancy.  By substance is not meant a 
mysterious entity which cannot be reached, and is hidden away under a 
shell of merely phenomenal realities -- whatever these may be -- like 
an Oriental monarch, awful in his utter unapproachability.  Listen to 
what are the essential demands of the schoolmen, who hold a very 
different doctrine.  Many of them, it is true, do suppose, between the 
quantity and the qualities of an object on one side, and their subject 
of inherence on the other side, a distinction so real, that it is 
second only to the distinction between substance and substance.  At the 
same time, they admit that such real distinction is not contained in 
the primary notion of substance; that it is a secondary point of 
investigation, quite open, on merely natural grounds, to strong 
controversy.</P> 

<P>But the primary notion of substance, the incontrovertible notion, 
the universal notion applying even to God Himself, Who is without 
accidents -- this they place in what they call <EM>perseity.</EM>  
Substance is what exists <EM>per se;</EM> and what to exist <EM>per 
se</EM> means is brought out by a contrast, the validity of which 
cannot be gainsaid.  We leave alone these accidents of quantity and 
quality which are supposed by some to be more than modal, and the 
nature of which is matter of dispute.  We keep to what is indisputable; 
thought, volition, motion, rotundity, these are in some sense 
realities, and yet none of them can exist <EM>per se,</EM> all must 
inhere in some subject, and are really distinct from that subject at 
least modally, or, inasmuch as they are modes, which may, or may not, 
affect a thing, while that thing remains substantially the same.  But 
they are only modes: no one yet ever came across rotundity existing by 
itself; no one ever met a piece of motion unattached, without a thing 
of which it was the movement.  Similarly a wandering thought or 
volition, in the sense of an entity which is nothing but a thought or a 
volition, an isolated phenomenon, is an absurdity.</P> 

<P>To recur again to examples.  A cannon-ball is now at rest, and now 
endowed with a most terrific velocity: in the one instance a child may 
support it, in the other hardly the strongest target that man can make 
will resist the momentum undamaged.  Therefore the velocity has some 
sort of a reality not wholly identified with the substance, as such, of 
the ball.  Again, the mind may rouse itself to intense thought, or 
yield to comparative quiescence; the thought is some sort of a reality 
not wholly identified with the substance mind.  There is then at least 
one class of accidents, the modal, which are real, and which present 
some real contrast to substance. These suffice to enforce the 
definition: "An accident is that which exists in another, as in a 
subject of inhesion;"<A HREF="#N_1_"><sup><small>{1}</small></sup></A> <P>  where the 
precise degree of real distinction involved by the <EM>in alio.</EM> 
may be left without further niceities of discussion.  Mill has a 
glimpse of the truth, soon to be lost amid erroneous ideas about the 
unknown <EM>substratum.</EM> In the third chapter of his <EM>Logic</EM> 
he says: "Destroy all white substances, and where would be absolute 
whiteness? Whiteness without any white thing is a contradiction in 
terms."</P> 

<P>As illustration of a doctrine, the full proof of which is to be 
sought in General Metaphysics, the above account must suffice to 
justify the assertion, that the radical notion of substance is 
intelligible and real. After the manner described,<A 
HREF="#N_2_"><sup><small>{2}</small></sup></A> "substance is that which exists by 
itself, and does not inhere in something else as in a subject of 
inhesion."<A HREF="#N_3_"><sup><small>{3}</small></sup></A> Realities cannot be 
inherent one in another indefinitely, any more than among substances 
the earth can be supported by a rock, and that rock by another, and 
this by a third, and so on unlimitedly; in the end there must be 
something which exists <EM>per se.</EM> Now <EM>per se</EM> might mean 
self-existent, uncreated, unproduced; but here it does not mean that: 
<EM>a se</EM> is the expression used to signify underived existence.  
God alone is <EM>a se,</EM> and therefore also He is <EM>per se.</EM> 
How <EM>perseity</EM> can be assigned to creatures without denying 
their continuous dependence on the Creator is a difficulty which is 
briefly met by saying, that unless some creatures were <EM>per 
se,</EM> all would inhere in God as accidents of the Divinity, as parts 
of His total reality.  This would be pantheism.</P> 

<P>Whence it further appears that the primary idea of substance is not 
permanence under varying accidents.  God is substance, though having no 
accidents.  He is immutable; created substance, though it were 
annihilated almost as soon as created, would have been for the moment 
real substance.</P> 

<P>Mr. Bain, therefore, is utterly wrong in saying that substance has 
no meaning; and Mr. Huxley, who says that "whether mind or matter has a 
substance or not, we are incompetent to discuss." But Mr. Spencer has 
got hold of a partial truth, when he holds, that "the conception of a 
state of consciousness implies the conception of an existence which has 
the state; we are compelled to think of a substance, mind, that is 
affected, before we think of its affections:" and that "it is 
rigorously impossible to conceive that our knowledge is of appearances 
only, without at the same time conceiving a reality, of which they are 
the appearances."<A HREF="#N_4_"><sup><small>{4}</small></sup></A> It is idle to 
pretend that the necessary recurrence to substance is a mere 
association of ideas, or a mere grammatical notion.  Grammar, it is 
true, distinguishes substantive and adjective; but so manifestly is 
this not the philosophical distinction between substance and accidents, 
that many nouns substantive confessedly stand for accidents, as 
velocity, rotundity, volition. Also, it is true, Aristotle teaches that 
the concrete substance, the <EM>prima substantia</EM>, 
<b>pr&ocirc;t&ecirc; ousia</b>, can never be predicated of anything 
else as of its subject; but what is this against the reality and the 
knowableness of substance? In the notion of substance we have got hold 
of the undoubtedly real.  We do not lay bare a great mystery, as many 
suppose we pretend to do; but we do affirm a clear truth, which is 
elementary in the human understanding, and without which the mind is 
lost in nihilism.</P> 

<P>(b) Efficient causality, like substance, is supposed to be a chimera 
by the disciples of Hume.  Again let us oppose our doctrine to theirs.  
We waive the question whether there are any substantial changes in 
nature: but at least there are real changes, and a vast multitude of 
them.  Forthwith we take our stand on plainest and surest of 
principles.  Nothing begins to be without a sufficient reason: real 
events are perpetually beginning to be in this world, which we 
familiarly style "a world of change:" the sufficient reason, or part 
of the sufficient reason, for a real change is an efficient cause.  
There are then real efficient causes, and we know that there are.  We 
do not know how efficient causality ultimately acts, but we know flat 
it acts.  We may be silent as to the difference or the identity between 
substance and its powers: but on the reality of the powers we may not 
be silent.  They clamour for recognition. If anything is certain in 
this world, it is that mere uniform sequence, without any idea of 
power, is an inadequate account of a real succession of events.  Mill, 
after the manner of his school, seems to be confounding the primary 
with the secondary question, the question as to the reality of power 
with the question of the reality of its distinction from its substance, 
when he says with an air of apparent triumph: "It is as easy to 
comprehend that the object should produce the sensation 
<EM>directly,</EM> as that it should produce the same sensation by the 
aid of <EM>something else,</EM> called the power of producing it." If 
the reader will admit <EM>substance efficiently active,</EM> without 
any question raised as to an intermediate reality between the substance 
and its activity, he will admit enough for the purposes of the 
following discussions on the details of certitude.  But if he will not 
admit thus much, he is putting himself in a radically unreasonable 
position.</P> 

<P>3. That these preliminary remarks, these borrowings from a 
department of philosophy outside our own, are not uncalled for, will be 
recognized immediately by any one who will consider the vast difference 
between certitude viewed from the point of pure phenomenalism, and 
certitude seen from the point of view here enforced.  Of course, as a 
matter of fact, no one is consistently a pure phenomenalist, believing 
only in appearances without a reality: and Mill's admission<A 
HREF="#N_5_"><sup><small>{5}</small></sup></A> that he cannot regard mind as "a 
series of states aware of itself as a series," without any bond of 
union, is a shabby acknowledgment of substance.  Nevertheless, the 
principles of pure phenomenalism are ever being insisted on, to the 
active promotion of the cause of scepticism; and the perpetual 
ridicule cast on faculties, or on anything beyond ideas, their 
associations, and their sequences, necessarily fosters agnostic 
conclusions.  The conclusions, when reached, contradict the principles 
which have been used to establish them; for, bad as the account is, the 
account which the pure empiricist gives of the genesis of mind, without 
substance and without efficient causality, by the heaped-up experiences 
of unconscious nerve-shock, involves more of real mind in its arguments 
than ever could have been supplied by a mind so generated.  Some real 
psychological knowledge, and some acute pieces of reasoning, are mixed 
up with the unreasonable parts of the procedure.  The upshot of the 
whole, however, is logically a complete destruction of the edifice of 
human knowledge.  Accept this theory of mind, and you have no mind 
left.</P> 

<P>Therefore, in this treatise, so much stress is laid upon starting 
from the notions of substance and efficient causality, as from real, 
indispensable groundworks for a philosophy of certitude.  Those who 
know something of the state of philosophic opinion in this country, 
will be ready to admit the relevancy of our brief reference to 
substance and causality, outside of the treatise in which they are 
properly discussed; and those whose reading has not qualified them 
to be judges on the matter, will do well to accept our assertion on 
faith for the present, and verify it themselves hereafter.</P>
