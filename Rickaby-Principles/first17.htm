<P>1. IT would be an error to limit the problem of idealism idealism to 
the, material world; and hence the last chapter does not cover the 
whole of the ground which has to be covered.  A question more deep-
reaching and more universal is, whether our ideas in general attain to 
objective reality, be this material or immaterial.</P> 

<P>That our ideas are not bounded by our sensations, but have a wider 
range, must be allowed by all who will take the trouble to go through 
an analysis of the notions which they possess.<sup><small><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></small></sup> It is true that a 
trace of man's organic conditions clings to his highest intellectual 
actions; but all the same these clearly manifest a power above sense.  
Against the theory advocated by Hume, and more or less favoured by many 
other English philosophers, that ideas are faded, attenuated, and 
almost etherialized sensations, facts are in dead opposition.  Even 
Lewes, who so largely makes verification by the senses the criterion of 
real knowledge, has the candour to say: " Ideas are not impressions at 
all, and hence not faint impressions.  Ideas are not sensible pictures.  
The least experience is sufficient to convince us that we have many 
ideas which cannot be reduced to any sensible picture." Mr.  Huxley, in 
his manual on <EM>Hume,</EM> is also a witness in our favour, 
maintaining that "the great merit of Kant is, that he upholds the 
doctrine of the existence of elements of consciousness which are 
neither sense-experiences nor any modifications of them." Plain facts 
of self-analysis do not need the support of confessions made by 
adversaries; but such support may usefully be borrowed as an 
accessory.</P> 

<P>2. To say now what precisely is idealism, presents a considerable 
degree of difficulty, because of the Protean character of the object to 
be dealt with; but without being able to tie the wily trickster down to 
one shape, we may be able to effect a sufficient capture for purposes 
of inspection.  Negatively an important observation is, that it is not 
idealism to maintain that the thing-in-itself is unknowable, when by 
thing-in-itself is meant an object out of all relation to knowledge.  
The stoutest realist would allow so much.  But idealism has its root 
mainly in these two contentions, that mind cannot go outcide of itself 
or of its own conscious states, and that least of all can mind truly 
represent to itself external matter.  The idealist, who on these 
grounds should venture to affirm that there is nothing outside his 
thought, and especially nothing material, would be so manifestly guilty 
of unwarrantable dogmatism, that we may pass him by and consider only 
the more plausible adversary, the strength of whose position lies in 
its being agnostic.  He does not deny, he only pleads his inability 
positively to affirm anything beyond the idealistic limit.  This limit 
he may variously set according to any one of the following formulae.  I 
am certain (a) only of present states of consciousness, as of 
subjective coruscations or modes; (b) only of present along with 
certain remembered and certain safely expected states; (c) only of 
past, present, and future states along with my substantial mind as the 
subject of these states. So far the two fundamental principles of 
idealism have been fairly, though in varying degrees, respected there 
has been no passage beyond the thinking self, and there has been no 
assertion of independent matter.  But many who would not dare to take 
up the last-mentioned of the three positions, make no hesitation in 
assuming the next, which is to idealism really a more formidable 
position, namely, (d) I am certain only of a series of conscious states 
which I know as my mind, and of other series which I know as states of 
consciousness in other minds. (e) With regard to an outer material 
world, some idealists, not quite thoroughgoing, claim to have a 
knowledge that it exists and acts upon them, but disclaim all knowledge 
about its real nature and properties.</P> 

<P>The above divisions are not meant historically to represent the 
several schools of idealism, but rather to show progressive steps from 
the extremest to a more moderate doctrine.  Berkeleyism, as having been 
already described, is omitted.  In all cases idealism is founded mainly 
on a common difficulty which is felt against realism -- a difficulty 
which shall now be stated in the words of an upholder of the system.  
The following passages, culled from Professor Caird's work on Kant, 
will convey the information required.  "The knowledge of thinas must 
mean that the mind finds itself in them, or in some way, that the 
difference between them and the mind is dissolved." "How can anything 
come within consciousness which is essentially different from 
consciousness? How can we think that which is <EM>ex hypothesi</EM> 
unthinkable?" "We can know objects because in so far as their most 
general determinations are concerned, we produce the objects we know." 
Thus the one method of asserting a knowledge of things is in some way 
to identify thing with thought, to make thought in some way the 
producer of its own things, so that <EM>esse</EM> shall be 
<EM>percipi.</EM> If a dualism, a real division between thought and 
thing, is allowed, then you have thought transcending itself and 
reaching to something other than itself; and the only way to get over 
this difficulty is by some such rough-and-ready but logically 
unjustifiable means, as that employed by Professor Clifford, when he 
says that he is satisfied with his ancestry for having evolved his mode 
of consciousness, and adds, "How consciousness can testify to the 
existence of anything outside of itself, I do not pretend to declare." 
Thus the alternatives seem to be either to identify thing with thought, 
or to pass from thing to thought, as it were, by brute force; unless, 
indeed, we are prepared to give up the attainability of real knowledge 
altogether, and confess that all things are unknowable, except passing 
mental conditions.</P> 

<P>3. One point, which has already been incidentally mentioned, may 
here be distinctly emphasized, when we are about to state what exactly 
we undertake to establish against idealism.  In asserting that ideas 
cannot transcend themselves, no plausible idealist affirms that there 
is no transcendent reality: he only asserts the powerlessness of the 
mind to make sure of it.  As Mr. Bain<sup><small><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup> remarks in an article in 
<EM>Mind,</EM> "The statement that there is no existence beyond 
consciousness, is not what an idealist would make; but what he says is, 
that we know only what we perceive.  Conscious properties make up 
object and subject alike: consciousness contains its object states and 
its subject states, and all our knowledge lies within the compass of 
these." In opposition to idealism as so propounded, without making 
special reference to the outer world of matter which was dealt with in 
the last chapter, we have as our substantial task to show (a) that 
there is no contradiction in the fact of the intellect, through its 
ideas, knowing objects really other than itself; and (b) that the 
objective reality of ideas must be admitted, because of its self-
evidence, and because the fact cannot even be denied without its being 
at the same time implicitly asserted.</P>

<P>4. These being substantially the points to be made good, the 
requirements will be found satisfied under the following arguments and 
conclusions:</P> 

<P>(a) Bilocation, or being present in two different places at once, is 
not naturally possible to a material body.  This is true, but does not 
affect realists, who do not suppose an idea to be an extended body, 
which has at the same time to transfer itself to a distant space.  So 
far, however, as an idea is indirectly subject to the conditions of 
space, it is physically present in only one spot, namely, in the soul 
united to a narrowly circumscribed body.  But besides having, as all 
other things have, a physical entity, an idea has something else 
peculiar to itself, its <EM>vis intentionalis,</EM> as the scholastics 
say, its power of going forth, not mechanically, but by way of 
intellectual perception.  Now, coolly to affirm, as idealists are in 
the habit of doing, that this power is unable to attain to anything 
outside the thinking subject, is not only the veriest piece of 
dogmatism, but is against the evidence of experience.  Not by any <EM>a 
priori</EM> assumptions, nor by a false analogy drawn from physics, but 
by the accurate interpretation of conscious facts, are we to know what 
ideas can do. A door-post, which has no ideas, can never be taught what 
is the power of ideas.  A man, precisely because he has ideas, can 
judge of their value, and his judgment must be formed on the case as 
presented in consciousness, not upon some hypothesis wholly arbitrary.  
Using the method of selfintrospection, we find that our ideas are -- in 
the wide sense of the word things -- things having a perceptive power.  
Nor is there the shadow of an argument to suggest that the perceptive 
power cannot reach to other objects, even to objects purely material 
and unintelligent.  As we do not know how intelligence produces its 
marvellous act, as that mysterious spiritual agency is above our ken, 
it is very arbitrary on our part to limit thought by the analogies of 
mechanical action.  Such an attempt breaks down at every point.  Even 
idealists themselves show the little store they set by their own theory 
in straightway disregarding it, and transgress. ing the boundaries put 
by themselves.  Their main limitation is that thought shall not 
transcend itself: hence, theoretically, present consciousness, viewed 
as a fact, ought with them to be the whole of positive knowledge.  Yet 
they one and all trust memory and expectation, thereby openly going 
beyond present fact.  Few would seek escape by a hopeless attempt to 
deny this: hence Mill candidly confesses, "The psychological theory 
cannot explain memory."<sup><small><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></small></sup> The few, however, who are venturesome 
enough to make the denial, would find their bold course lead only to 
speedy confusion; for they would have to abide rigorously by their 
statement, "We know only our present conscious condition." "Very well," 
is the reply, "define your term 'present.' If it is an absolute, 
unextended point, then it is of no service to you, and is most 
flagrantly against the law that a certain persistence in consciousness 
is necessary in order to secure advertence.  If your 'present' is not 
an unextended point, then it has a certain duration: it involves a past 
and a present, and you begin to be in the same condition as your bolder 
brethren, who openly claim to believe in memory and expectation, and 
who so far give up the dogma that thought cannot transcend itself."</P> 

<P>Another surrender, and a more glaring one, of the same dogma, is the 
almost unanimous admission by idealists of "other men," or other 
consciousnesses; which is surely a full confession, that for thought to 
reach an object other than itself, it needs the accomplishment of no 
self-contradictory feat.</P> 

<P>If considerations like the above have the salutary effect only of 
making the idealist less confident of his assumed position, and more 
respectful to the secure judgment of the <EM>orbis terrarum;</EM> if 
they only rouse him to ask himself by what right he takes it for 
granted, that thought must be shut up in itself, then they have been 
not without the beginnings of success.</P> 

<P>(b) To carry these beginnings further, we may urge upon the 
thorough-going idealist, to whom thought is not for certain anything 
more than a mental firework, that he has been all along supposing the 
objective validity of thought in arguing out his conclusion;<sup><small><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></small></sup> and that 
his very assertion, as to the nature of ideas, is founded on the belief 
that his ideas concerning this point are objectively valid.  On the 
strength of valid ideas he tries to prove ideas invalid, thus taking up 
the position of the universal sceptic, which we have seen to be 
untenable.  Also we have seen that evidence is the guarantee of truth. 
Now to any one who will make fair use of his faculties, there is 
evidence for the general truth that his ideas are objectively real, 
even when they are about objects not actually existent, but only 
possible. The result cannot be the conclusion of strict demonstration, 
that is, of an inference from the known to the unknown.  For no 
premisses can be framed which do not assume the conclusion.  The fact, 
then, must be taken on its own self-evidence, than which no other and 
no better guarantee can be given.  Mediate knowledge, through means of 
proof, has no advantage over intuition, for it must rest finally on 
intuition; nor is the evidence whereby we see the sequence of an 
argument more valid than the evidence, whereby we assent to the simpler 
truths of immediate knowledge.  To fancy otherwise is a common delusion 
with our adversaries.</P> 

<P>But about intuition there is a confusion to be cleared up, and a 
mistake to be removed.  Some limit intuition to the case where the 
object itself is actually present in the mind; as is the condition of 
those facts of our own consciousness, which, Malebranche says, we know 
"without ideas," or as the scholastics would say, through no vicarious 
"species." How, then, do the schoolmen, insisting on the need of the 
"species" for all objects outside the mind itself, yet manage to assert 
an intuition of some such objects? By means of the distinction, already 
explained, between a <EM>signum quo</EM> and a <EM>signum ex quo.</EM>  
Unfortunately adversaries, from a leaning to materialism' often test 
the case only on the merits of external bodies, about which there is 
admittedly a difficulty, such as to cause certain followers even of 
orthodox philosophy to declare themselves "cosmothetic idealists" -- 
that is, they hold that an inference is requisite to make sure of the 
externality of a body.  But setting aside this vexed question, we can 
have recourse to intuitions of truths, the objects of which are 
certainly not part of ourselves, and not in themselves bound up with 
the actual existence of an outside world of matter.  Such for example 
are the truths contained in the propositions, "What is, cannot at the 
same time not be;" "Every new event must have an adequate cause." Here 
the ideas, "being," "not being," "event," "cause," cannot really be 
resolved into simpler constituents, but are seen in themselves, as soon 
as they are possessed, to be no idle fireworks of the mind, but to have 
an objective meaning, leading at once to the enunciations above made.  
They are <EM>signa quibus,</EM> a phrase fairly illustrated by some 
quotations to be found in Hamilton's edition of Reid's <EM>Intellectual 
Powers,</EM><sup><small><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></small></sup> where, however, neither author nor editor are exactly 
of our mind.  Take first this note of Hamilton's: "Arnauld did not 
allow that <EM>perceptions</EM> and <EM>ideas</EM> are really or 
numerically distinguished, <EM>i.e.,</EM> as one thing from another; 
nor even that they are modally distinguished, <EM> i.e.,</EM> as a 
thing from its mode.  He maintained that they are really identical, and 
only rationally discriminated, as viewed in different relations; the 
indivisible mental modification being called a <EM>perception,</EM> by 
reference to the mind or thinking subject, an <EM>idea</EM> by 
reference to the <EM>mediate</EM> object, or thing thought." This word 
"mediate" should have been omitted: the immediate object of the mind, 
as percipient, is not primarily the idea itself -- though we shall see 
self also entering in, when we come to describe consciousness -- but it 
is that which is signified by the idea.  This immediate object is 
always given intuitively, though it may require an inference to refer 
it to some larger whole, or to settle its existence in or as some 
actual thing. In other words, every idea has a meaning, that is, an 
immediate object; every idea is the intuition of an object, complete or 
partial.  Hence Descartes is cited in the place referred to, as 
describing ideas to be "thoughts so far forth as they bear the 
character of images,"<sup><small><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></small></sup> and Buffier as writing: " If we confine 
ourselves to what is intelligible in our observations on ideas, we 
shall say that they are nothing but mere modifications of the mind as a 
thinking being.  They are called <EM>ideas</EM> with regard to the 
object represented, and <EM>perceptions</EM> with regard to the faculty 
representing.  It is manifest that our ideas, considered in this sense, 
are not more distinguished than motion is from a body moved." Besides, 
then, the intuitions of states of self, we may have intuitions of 
objects that are not self; and the view that the mind first looks at an 
image within itself, and then vainly tries to compare this image with 
some object wholly outside itself, would be very fatal to realism, if 
it were the true account of the process: but it happens to be a 
caricature, or at any rate an unintentional piece of very bad 
drawing.</P> 

<P>Briefly to resume.  Our refutation of idealism is, that its 
falsehood appears upon immediate evidence, for no one can have the 
normal faculties of a man without some real knowledge coming home to 
him, and showing him that he has really the power to know.  To argue 
against this fact is to imply its admission.  Hence, in the First Part 
of this book, the capability of the human mind to attain to truth was 
put down as the first condition to be granted at the very outset of 
philosophy.  Ideas cannot then, as Mr. Huxley surmises, be mere flashes 
in the mental pan, hitting no mark, and quite ineffectual for objective 
knowledge.  If the argument against idealism should to some appear 
scarcely to be an argument, the reason lies, not in the weakness of the 
cause, but in the fact that the case is too elementarily clear to allow 
of demonstration strictly so called; and in that sense alone "the 
opposite of idealism cannot be proved." Man, being intelligent, in the 
very exercise of his faculty is immediately assured of its existence 
and of its validity, and to ask a more roundabout proof is to demand 
the preposterous and the impossible.  Every idea is necessarily 
representative or cognitive of something, and only in the rare 
instances where we are reflecting upon our ideas themselves, are 
ideas the direct and principal objects of our intellect.</P> 

<P>5. When we assert that the object of our ideas is real, the word 
"real" is very liable to misunderstanding.  In a narrower sense "real" 
means only the actually and physically existent; but as used in this 
chapter, the "real" is whatever either has or might have its own 
physical existence, and does not exist formally as an object of thought 
alone, as also whatever is a real aspect of such an actual or possible 
entity.  It is what logicians strictly understand by "a first 
intention," as opposed to "a second intention," that is, to an object 
which, as formally described, could not exist except as the term of the 
mind, because the mind, with its abstractions and reflections, has 
imposed upon it some conditions essentially mental.  Such are genera 
and species, subjects and predicates, and universal ideas, all which 
are essentially logical entities, with no more than a ground for their 
formation, in the extra-mental order.  Besides these, everything else 
which is truly the object of an idea, is, in the present use of the 
word, "real;" though often that which is allowed to pass for an idea, 
is in fact no idea at all, being but a contradictory medley of ideas, 
never fused into one idea.  It is a false judgment, or fancy, that 
there is such fusion between mutually repellent elements, for example a 
square triangle."</P> 

<P>6. It is useless, however, to urge the objective reality of ideas 
unless a special explanation is given of universal ideas, which seem to 
be condemned by the admitted fact, that every real object, actual or 
possible, is singular.  Under the very false impression that all 
realism, when the word is used in its connexion with universals, must 
be of the exaggerated form, which asserts universality <EM>a parte 
rei,</EM> modern writers overlook that moderate realism which, giving 
to things what belongs to them, and to the mind's own operations what 
belongs to them, is manifestly the true doctrine.</P> 

<P>(a) We shall get at the root of the solution if we observe the 
difference of condition between an infinite nature and a finite.  The 
infinite nature does not allow of a multiplicity of individuals: there 
is but one God, and there cannot be more, for, as is shown in natural 
theology, a plurality of individuals, having a nature infinitely 
perfect, involves a contradiction, so that the three Persons are but 
one God.<sup><small><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></small></sup> But the case is altered with finite natures.  Among them no 
one individual can claim to exhaust the possibilities of the nature; no 
one is so a man as to fill up, in his own person, the whole 
capabilities of humanity.  However great the man, there is room enough 
in creation for others; and if "there is no necessary man," still more 
is there no all-exhaustive man.  Any created nature, and any character 
about it, may be specifically repeated an indefinite number of times.  
In the controversy between Leibnitz and Clarke as to whether two 
examples of the same species can be so thoroughly alike that the only 
difference existing between them is that they are individually diverse, 
the affirmative is the right answer. Anything that has once been done 
may have its exact copy in another individual, yet the individualities 
are separate.  Another Adam, in all respects like Adam, but not Adam, 
might have been the first man. But here we see reason enough why no 
universality <EM>a parte rei</EM> is possible.  There <EM>always 
must</EM> be the difference that one individual is not another, while, 
<EM>de facto,</EM> besides this, there are always other differences, at 
least in accidentals.  Nevertheless, we cling to what we have before 
said, and, insisting on the similarities in the midst of mentally 
negligeable dissimilarities, we affirm that the real likenesses between 
several creatures give the foundation for universal ideas.</P> 

<P>(b) We have now to determine the way in which universal ideas can be 
formed, so as to be predicable of real things and still not to 
introduce any falsehood into the predication.  It is certain that all 
the individual differences cannot be physically abstracted; such 
abstraction must be mental; and the mind has to be careful not to 
attribute its own processes to nature.  By virtue of its reflective 
power the human intellect has a mode of coming to agreements with 
itself, which wonderfully serve the purposes of knowledge.  Thus, being 
finite, it cannot directly represent to itself what an infinite object 
is; but by a contrivance it can obtain sufficiently an idea of the 
infinite; for it knows what limited being is, and it has only to deny 
the limit in order to form a true, though imperfect, conception of the 
infinite. Similarly it is by a contrivance that we fashion for 
ourselves a universal idea, the requisites of which are, that it shall 
be "univocally predicable of several individuals, taken singly or 
distributively." Thus "man" is predicable of Peter, Paul, John, and 
James: all and each are men.  A direct and a reflex universal must both 
conspire to make up the whole.  The direct universal is of "first 
intention:" it picks out some nature or attribute, prescinded from its 
individuality, as in the perfectly unindividualized conception of 
<EM>virtue, vice, substance, round.</EM>  The individuality is not 
denied, but merely put out of the reckoning, as is indeed all 
"extension" of the term.  Next comes the reflex universal due precisely 
to the addition of "extension" by the observation that a concept so 
prescinded may be applied to each of many individuals presenting the 
notes contained in the comprehension.  "Mammal," let us say, is the 
notion we gather from the inspection of a cow; advertence to the 
applicability of this idea to many individuals, actual or possible, 
gives the reflex universal.  Because of the process which forms the 
direct universal, the universal is sometimes called an abstract idea; 
and it is so inasmuch as it is always abstracted from individualizing 
differences.  But because Pure Logic has found it convenient to define 
"abstract term" as one which goes a greater length in the way of 
abstraction, and exhibits a form without a subject," <EM>e.g.,</EM> 
"rotundity," "humanity," "mammality;" we may respect this appropriation 
of a word, and say that "rotund," "human," "mammal," are 
<EM>prescinded</EM> or <EM>abstracted</EM> terms instead of calling 
them <EM>abstract.</EM>  The abstraction, it cannot be too often 
remarked, is mental and not attributed to the things themselves: 
whereas the characters expressed by the prescinded terms are in the 
things themselves, and are attributed to them.  It is a real 
predication when we say of a corpulent old gentleman that he is 
"human," "rotund," and "mammalian."</P> 

<P>To go through the whole account once more in the way of 
illustration.  Looking at a triangle, we see its essence to be a plane 
figure bounded by three straight lines.  This is our intellectual 
insight into the <EM>quiddity</EM> or <EM>whatness</EM> of the thing.  
Any existent triangle will be scalene, or isosceles, drawn in white 
chalk, or in red chalk, and so forth: but content with the quiddity, we 
neglect these individual peculiarities, though any one of them might be 
singled out, and treated just as we are treating the essential 
triangularity itsell But to rest content with one example at a time, we 
have the prescinded conception, "plane figure bounded by three straight 
lines." This is the direct universal, universal as yet only <EM>in 
potentia</EM> but made so <EM>in actu,</EM> when we recognize it, on 
reflexion, to be a concept which is one in many different individuals, 
actual or possible.  There may be thousands of figures, each of which 
is a triangle, and admits, univocally with the rest, the predicate 
"triangle." The one concept, regarded as the common predicate of many, 
is a logical entity, a "second intention:" the direct meaning of that 
concept, in "comprehension," is literally true of each individual, and 
is "a first intention."</P> 

<P>The whole of which doctrine is condensed by the scholastics into the 
phrase, "Universals are <EM>formally</EM> only in the mind, but 
<EM>fundamentally</EM> they are in things." Things are really like one 
another; and this is the foundation whereon the mind proceeds to build, 
when conceiving the likeness, and prescinding from individual 
differences, it ranks similar individuals under one common idea.  We 
each fall under the concept "man," though no single one of us is 
simply "man" without individual differences, and though physically we 
each form no unity with other men.</P> 

<P>(c) The objection that every idea is physically one thing, with one 
meaning attached to it, simple or complex, can be met by us with the 
reply that this holds of the direct universal, and is remedied, for 
purposes of universality, by the reflex act which we have described.  
For example, an idea of <EM>triangle</EM> is one psychological state of 
the mind, and it has one complex signification: but on reflexion this 
one signification can be applied to several. individuals.  Hereupon we 
are led to remark the incompetence of the sensist theory, which 
accounts for universals thus: Repeated sensations from resembling 
bodies produce a common image by a process comparable to a recent 
device in photography.  The photographs of several persons, for example 
mathematicians, either by a simultaneous or by a successive method, are 
superposed and combined into one image, on the principle that only 
those features which are repeated sufficiently often in the different 
originals will leave a marked impression on the sensitized plate upon 
which the aggregate image is thrown.  Other features are either lost, 
or but faintly indicated.  The result is that a sort of average face 
stands out, in which enthusiasts are glad to find the resemblance of 
some individual who has been famous in mathematics, and who is thus 
proved to have had the typical countenance.  By no such process could a 
universal idea be reached; for the average image is still singular, 
applicable rather to none than to all mathematicians; for even the 
favourite to whom it is assigned is allowed to be not accurately 
represented.  Moreover, the photograph has no self-referring power at 
all: it keeps strictly at home.  Assuredly there is no power in sense-
images properly to abstract and universalize; and such common images as 
the lower animals can frame certainly do not reach to the standard of 
universal ideas.  Hence we must insist very strongly on the strictly 
intellectual character of the process of universalizing, and on the 
fact that abstraction is no mere dropping of sensile details, without 
the addition of some active power of intelligence which is above 
sense.<sup><small><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>(d) If to form a general notion it is often necessary to multiply 
observations and comparisons of individuals, the reason is not that 
suggested by the analogy of the average photograph.  One observation 
would suffice for the framing of any universal idea, if at once we 
could observe things through and through, and know all about them.  One 
observation as to how a circle is drawn would, as a matter of fact, 
suffice for the universal idea of a circle, because the mode of genesis 
is so clear.  But in physical matters we are liable to all those 
difficulties of generalization which are studied under the heading of 
Induction, and for which Mill's canons were originally devised, and 
have since been improved upon by later writers.</P> 

<P>(e) The difficulties of universalizing are often so great that we do 
not accomplish the result, but manage to get along with terms still 
left in the vague.  An ordinary man has never found it necessary to 
settle for himself precisely what he means by a tiger, a hippopotamus, 
or even a horse.  He has vaguely outlined images of these several 
animals in his brain, and these suffice for ordinary purposes.  If 
called upon to assign the precise marks which he included under each 
name, he would be nonplussed; the finer discrimination would be beyond 
his powers.  A rustic, whose idea of fish was formed simply on what the 
hawker sold him under the pleasant name of "fresh herring," would be 
quite puzzled if taken into a town to see an aquarium, or even a 
fishmonger's shop: while a day spent with a merman "at the bottom of 
the deep blue sea," would utterly overwhelm him by the endless display 
of fishy varieties.  Even a learned man may often be betrayed into 
calling a whale a fish, and it was a fish so far as the old usage went.  
In view of facts like these, we have only to say, that ideas which have 
never been properly abstracted and universalized must not be brought as 
specimens of universal ideas.  There are genuine specimens, and these 
we must use as illustrations.  We shall find them especially in 
mathematical and moral definitions: as also in some of those physical 
laws -- for example, the laws of motion, which have been satisfactorily 
formulated.</P> 

<P>(f) What has been asserted of ideas is still more applicable to 
words.  An idea strictly is never vague: and if an idea is said to be 
indefinite or to vary, it is not one idea, but the addition or the 
subtraction of ideas, or the element of indistinctness, which is 
variable.  Why, the mere exercise of school-boy translation was enough 
to teach us, how far words are from having each a neatly defined 
signification, and the special employment of technical terms by 
scientific men is a contrast which calls attention to the looseness of 
ordinary usage.  Certainly, we cannot flatter ourselves that, by the 
aid of a dictionary, we shall be able to read intelligently any book 
written in our own language, no matter how recondite the subject.  
Words, then, are no immediate test of the doctrine about 
universals.</P> 

<P>(g) We may take leave of the matter with an answer to a difficulty 
which Mill<sup><small><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></small></sup> urges in this shape: In order to get your abstracted 
general term you must isolate its contents: but this the law of 
inseparable association forbids you to do: what has always been united 
in experience and cannot be conceived to be disunited, must always 
cohere in thought.  Against this fancied difficulty, the power of the 
mind, by reflexion, to come to agreements with itself, must once more 
be insisted upon.  To abstract a common nature or a common attribute, 
it is not necessary to shut out concomitant ideas of individual 
peculiarities; it is quite enough to know which are the common notes, 
and to resolve to take account of them alone.  It is possible in 
society to ignore the presence of a man, of which yet you are aware.  
If any one has the general notion of a plane triangle as a plane figure 
bounded by three straight lines, it in no way stops his reasonings upon 
this abstracted nature, if there is concomitantly in his imagination, 
or in his thoughts, the representation of scalene or isosceles 
properties.  These may be present to the mind and yet wholly left out 
of count in a selected line of thought.  Otherwise all reasoning would 
be baffled: for we always have an accompaniment of variously suggested 
ideas going along with the main ideas, but excluded from entrance upon 
the course of argument.  Whatever may be our doctrine about the number 
of thoughts that can be present to the mind at one time, we must find 
room for that familiar experience, whereby consciousness has its point 
of greatest attention surrounded by a region of diminishing advertence, 
and shades off into the subconscious and the unconscious.  There is one 
brightest spot, and round it there is a fainter halo: there is a 
substantial vesture of thought, and to it adheres a fringe.  But we can 
abstract what part of the whole we like, by our will to do it.  Ideas 
need not be in our mind like so many sharply distinct atoms: they may 
be there after the analogy of parts in a network or in an organized 
body, and yet we can fix upon such a portion as we choose, and 
equivalently isolate it.  Mill himself allows that we can so do, though 
he makes a great fuss about the inseparability of uniformly associated 
ideas:<sup><small><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></small></sup> "The formation of a concept does not consist in separating 
the attributes, which are said to compose it, from all other attributes 
of the same object.  We neither conceive them, nor think them, nor 
cognize them in any way, as a thing apart, but solely as forming, in 
combination with other attributes, the idea of an individual object.  
But though thinking them only as part of a larger agglomeration, we 
have the power of fixing our attention on them, to the neglect of the 
other attributes with which we think them combined.  While the 
concentration of attention actually lasts, if it is sufficiently 
intense, we may be teniporarily unconscious of any other attributes, 
and may really, for a brief interval, have nothing present to our mind 
but the attributes constituent of the concept.  In general, however, 
the attention is not so completely exclusive as this: it leaves room in 
consciousness for other elements of the concrete idea.  General 
concepts, therefore, we have properly speaking, none; but we are able 
to attend exclusively to certain parts of the concrete idea, and by 
that exclusive attention we allow those parts to determine exclusively 
the course of thoughts as called up by association." If Mill would only 
cease to make mind so much of a mere machine, and if he would make it, 
instead, an intellectual faculty proceeding on insight, with a vast 
power of spontaneity, with a power to reflect, to abstract, and to come 
to agreements about its own operations: and, if further he would 
observe that to think certain characters apart need not mean, and does 
not mean, the same thing as to think that in real objects these 
characters do actually exist apart; then he would have little scruple 
in revoking that portion of his own declaration: "General concepts we 
have properly speaking none." Also he would make less of the necessity 
for an association with words, such that "the association of the 
particular set of attributes with a given word is what keeps them 
together in the mind, by a stronger tie than that with which they are 
associated with the remainder of the concrete image." If only he could 
have formed a truer conception of how human intelligence works, and had 
taken warning in season from the necessity under which he found himself 
to make such confessions as, "I have never pretended to account by 
association for the idea of time," Mill would have ceased to regard it 
as a misfortune, that mankind ever took up the expression, "General 
conception."</P> 

<P>7. The object of this whole chapter has been to defend the objective 
validity of ideas in general; but not of course to say, in detail, what 
ideas in each science are the correct representatives of reality. The 
main root of difference between adversaries and ourselves, is that they 
will insist, contrary to us, in regarding knowledge as primarily not a 
knowledge of things but of ideas.  They imagine that what we first of 
all know are always subjective affections as such -- <EM>signa ex 
quibus</EM> and not <EM>signa quibus</EM> -- and then of course they 
see no way to a proof that these subjective affections are like objects 
without; rather they are inclined to believe that there can be no 
likeness, but at most a symbolic correspondence. But this is not the 
legitimate interpretation of the doctrine that the mind perceives 
through ideas.  The mind perceives through ideas, not in the sense that 
it looks at ideas first, and then passes on to infer things; but in the 
sense that the mind, at least under one aspect, begins as a <EM>tabula 
rasa,</EM> and only in proportion as it stores itself with ideas is it 
rendered by them cognisant of objects. The mind, as informed by an 
idea, is cognisant of an object: but the idea, as has been so often 
repeated, is a <EM>signum quo,</EM> not <EM>signum ex quo;</EM> it has 
not first to be known, but is itself constitutive of the act of 
knowledge.  A world of misconceptions would be saved if the right view 
of the office of ideas were acquired -- misconceptions which have led 
to the false definitions of truth exemplified in our opening chapter.  
In support of our own definition we need only a right appreciation 
about the nature of ideas; then ideas are seen to be objectively valid, 
and true knowledge is perceived to be the conformity of thought to 
tlilng.  We thus escape the deduction from Helmholtz's theory of 
sensation -- the deduction, namely, that our sensations being non-
resembling, signs of external things, all our ideas are nonresembling 
signs so far as they concern objects outside ourselves.  Briefly, we 
recognize that we have a power of real knowledge, not reducible to a 
mechanical reaction, or quasi-chemical combination.</P> 

<P>ADDENDA.</P>

<P>(1) It is a fancy of some semi-idealists that the thing-in-itself is 
something out of a relation to knowledge, and therefore not knowable 
for what it is.  The mind gives to this unintelligible thing a form of 
its own, frames a symbol for it, but symbol and symbolized have nothing 
alike between them.</P> 

<P>(2) The supposed impossibility of <EM>knowledge</EM> transcending 
the conscious state is really not kept to, by those who profess to keep 
within the impossible limit.  Thus Mr. Spencer<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> has to have recourse 
to all the convenience of <EM>knowledge</EM> extending beyond the 
conscious state, under the subterfuge of calling this knowledge by 
another name.  He savs, "though <EM>consciousness</EM> of an existence, 
which is beyond consciousness, is inexpugnable, the extra-conscious not 
only remains <EM>inconceivable</EM> in nature, but the nature of its 
connexion with consciousness cannot be truly <EM>conceived.</EM> Ever 
restrained within its limits, but ever trying to exceed them, 
consciousness cannot but use the forms of its activity in figuring to 
itself that which cannot be brought within these forms." Thus we are 
<EM>conscious</EM> of an outer reality which we do not 
<EM>conceive</EM> or <EM>know.</EM> The artifice here is ingenious but 
unsatisfactory; any fact which <EM>consciousness</EM> enables us with 
certainty to predicate, deserves to be called <EM>knowledge.</EM></P> 

<P>(3). The word "intuition" has been employed above with a risk of 
misinterpretation.  For, not to mention other views, on a theory given 
more or less explicitly by different writers, an "intuition" stands for 
an implanted instinct to believe something, without either imniediate 
or mediate evidence. As used in this work, an intuition is no innate 
idea or perception, and no specially communicated knowledge: it is 
simply knowledge on immediate evidence.  An instance in point is man's 
perception that his ideas have objective validity; on perceiving a 
clear truth he has an intuition of the validity of his faculties; and 
without this intuition he never could ascertain the fact by strict 
process of inference.<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup> There are, moreover, intuitive perceptions 
beyond this matter of self-consciousness and in the region of the 
<EM>non-ego.</EM></P> 

<P>(4) Another point, already touched upon, may be further elucidated.  
With logicians an "abstract" idea is strictly one representing "a form 
without any subject," <EM>e.g.,</EM> "humanity." But any universal term 
abstracted from individual peculiarities, is often called abstract, 
<EM>e.g.,</EM> "man." The fact is there are degrees of abstraction 
increasing in extent: from the concrete article in his hand the bowler, 
at a cricket-match, may progressively abstract the terms ",ball," 
"spherical," "sphericity." Only the last of these words is an abstract 
in the full sense required by Pure Logic.  With Hegel any word, not 
significant of the whole universe, was an abstract term, so complete 
did he make the unity of the whole. Thus, as we are not omniscient, all 
our knowledge would be abstract, though Hegel calls much of it concrete 
as judged by its own lower standard.</P> 

<P>(5) In admitting that the mental process departs, in the formation 
of universal ideas, from strict reality, we are only allowing the mind 
to do what it often does without risk of falsehood.  In nature the line 
of progress is from causes to effects: in our knowledge the progress 
ordinarily is from effects to causes; what logically is the premiss to 
a conclusion is often, in the ontological order, a consequence of the 
fact, or the principle, stated in the conclusion.  We may argue God's 
wisdom from the order in creation, but the order in creation is a 
consequent upon the Divine wisdom.  Again, we often make mental 
distinctions where we know there is no real distinction: as when we 
divide God into a nature with distinct attributes.  Any departure, 
therefore, which in the formation of universals is made away from 
reality, can be recognized as such, and need not be asserted of the 
reality.  To the real that alone need be assigned which belongs to 
it.</P> 

<P>(6) Hence we know what to reply to those who, like Professor Huxley, 
maintain that our generalized laws of nature are not real but ideal.  
It is true that, supposing the law to he correctly formulated, there is 
no general law of gravitation apart from the several particles of 
matter which attract; but as each and all do attract, the universalized 
law is real in all that it attributes to nature.  The difficulty is 
solved in the general solution of the problem concerning the reality of 
universal ideas; and to declare that generalized laws are not real, is 
a statement more likely to mislead than to instruct.  They are real so 
far as they are applied to nature, and have their foundation there.</P> 

<P>(7) Now that we are coming to an end of the doctrine about 
universals, we may observe that there seems more difficulty about 
individualizing our ideas than about universalizing them.  The Divine 
nature excepted, every other term, in its mere statement, might belong 
to an indefinite number of individuals. "The first man" might have been 
quite another; and all that we have recorded of Julius Caesar might 
have been verified of another man, down to the minutest detail, which 
human description can record. For we never have an intuition of 
individuality itself as such.  Our demonstrative pronoun itself, backed 
up by additional terms, "this very individual," is left a universal, 
unless we can fix it, proximately or remotely, by some fact of concrete 
experience.  Touch a thing, while you call it "this," and you are 
fastening upon an individual; but mere ideas without an experienced 
connexion in fact either your own experience or the experience of some 
one else, -- will not carry you out of the universal. "This man" has 
no individuality till it is somehow concreted in experience.</P> 

<P>(8) The true doctrine about realism was settled very early in the 
course of the scholastic disputations; not that some did not continue 
to go wrong, but the right statement was elicited and widely 
recognized.  This is a point on which it is hopeless to consult an 
ordinary nonscholastic author; as soon as ever you see him starting the 
subject of the old controversy about universals, as a rule you may say 
to yourself, "Now for some quite incompetent criticism, and a large 
display of ignorance." As a single specimen of one who early formulated 
the doctrine of moderate realism we will take neither Albert the Great 
nor St. Thomas, but a contemporary Dominican, the preceptor in the home 
of St. Louis of France, Vincent of Beauvais.<sup><small><a href="#n_c">{c}</a></small></sup> "Universals," he 
writes, "are not in the intellect alone.  For men have one common 
undivided nature, which is humanity, by reason of which each is called 
man; and that which is thus participated by all is called universal." 
Realism of the most extravagant type! the reader will perhaps exclaim; 
but let him have the patience to continue.  "What is common is their 
<EM>specific</EM> likeness, which <EM>by the intellect is taken in 
abstraction from the individitalities.</EM>  For as a line cannot exist 
apart from matter, and yet the intellect makes no false judgment when 
it abstracts the line from the matter, because it does not think that 
the two are really separable, but merely thinks of the line without 
taking account of the matter; so in general any universal, though it 
cannot be apart from its singulars, yet can become an object of 
intelligence, while no attention is being paid to what is individual." 
This clear explanation invites comparison with modern statements, such 
as that of Dr. Maudsley, when he says, that while "no animal, as far 
as we can judge, is capable of forming an <EM>abstract</EM> idea, there 
is good reason to think that the more intelligent animals are able to 
form a few <EM>general</EM> ideas." Generalization without abstraction 
is impossible, if the author is speaking strictly of a general idea.  
To return to the mediaevalists, however; they so talk of abstracting 
the essence from the individual accidents, that a reader might suppose 
they confined universals to essential predications.  But though they 
thus emphasize one of the most important cases of universalization, 
they fully allow that any attribute may be abstracted and made a 
universal term; but in all instances alike this will be considered in 
its <EM>quiddity</EM> or nature, for accidents also have their 
<EM>quiddity.</EM></P> 

<P>(9) The objective validity of ideas once established, it is not 
necessary explicitly to argue that judgments and reasonings are valid 
processes, when they properly embody these ideas.  Distinct 
propositions on these subjects may be found in the ordinary text-
books;<sup><small><a href="#n_d">{d}</a></small></sup> but it is not difficult for any intelligent reader to guess 
the substance of the arguments employed.</P>
