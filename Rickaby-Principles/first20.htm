<P>1. IT would be a fatal thing for us if we had not what is sometimes 
called mental adhesiveness, that is, if nothing which we learnt 
"stuck." But we all recognize a power of retentiveness.  Though the 
amount of knowledge which, at any one time, is actualized in the mind 
may be small, yet, below the surface of consciousness, and, under many 
limits, ready at call, is a comparatively vast mass of gathered 
information, and of skill in its use.  Some writers, after Aristotle, 
distinguish a storing power (<b>mn&ecirc;m&ecirc;</b>) from a 
subsequent recalling power (<b>anamn&ecirc;sis</b>); but it will be 
enough for us to include both under the one name, Memory, habitual and 
actual.</P> 

<P>This memory is not so clearly defined a term, even in its wider 
usage, as we might imagine.  A person is rather loth to say that he 
remembers a road which he is taking almost every day of his life, or 
the meaning of a word told him only a minute ago.  The definition of 
memory ought to include two elements, the recalling of the past, and 
its recognition as past.  To begin with the first element: if a new 
thought is sustained in the consciousness for five minutes, we may 
agree -- and it is partly a matter of agreement -- not to call this 
memory.  But if a thought is allowed once to sink below actual 
consciousness, and then is resuscitated, no matter how speedily, we may 
call this Memory, so far as it fulfils the requirement of a recalling 
of the past.  In practice, however, it is often impossible to say 
whether we have momentarily let go an idea or not; and furthermore, 
when the interval is very small, as there is no sufficient test of 
retentive power, men seldom care to distinguish such a revival from the 
first impression or conception.  The second element of memory has its 
absence illustrated by the man who honestly repeats his friend's 
epigram or joke as his own, wondering the while at his own readiness of 
wit; or again, by the old person whose memories are mistaken by him for 
present circumstances. Though, however, we distinguish remembered from 
fresh knowledge, we should bear in mind that the adult never discovers 
anything altogether new: his fresh acquisitions always combine together 
with a great many old stores.  We should at once feel the puzzle of 
locating an entirely new fact; and in general we may safely affirm of 
every adult man, that every act of knowledge which he elicits must be 
largely made up of memories.</P> 

<P>2. The veracity of memory, as a general faculty, is made intuitively 
evident during the course of its use.  Even Mill was driven to allow, 
that we must put an intuitive trust in our power of reminiscences 
though he forbore to make the handsome acknowledgment that in so doing 
we are not blindly instinctive.  Again, Dr. Ward,<sup><small><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></small></sup> in his passage of 
arms with Mr. Huxley, was undoubtedly triumphant over the Professor 
when the latter undertook to show, that the validity of memory can be 
proved empirically by successive trials, overlooking the fact that for 
the knowledge of the success of these repeated experiences he was 
relying all the time on memory.  Yet we all must admit, it is only in 
experience that memory shows its powers, and brings them home to 
consciousness; there is no <EM>a priori</EM> revelation of its 
trustworthiness.  Allowing a certain intuitive perception of the 
validity of the faculty given in its first exercise, a man can then go 
on to test the extent of its ability; and he can confirm his confidence 
by sundry experiments not difficult to devise.  In like manner, it is 
empirically that some men learn that their memory is very deficient, or 
has <EM>lacunae</EM> in it.  At times a fact which we directly remember 
may be further verified by calculating back from present data, and 
proving that the fact must have been as remembered.  These admissions 
may safely be made about the possibility of putting memory to the 
proof: all the same, the ultimate guarantee for the validity of the 
faculty is the immediate evidence brought forth in the exercise of 
remembering; and this is implied in all our proofs.</P> 

<P>3. While, however, memory is undoubtedly a valid faculty, its 
limited character is equally beyond a doubt.  It may fail in either of 
its branches, either that of recalling or that of recognizing.  For 
practical purposes much that we have once learnt is lost as explicit 
knowledge; and many facts are so vaguely recollected, that we do not 
know whether to call them reminiscences or imaginations.  The important 
point in connexion with the weakness of memory, is not to be deceived 
into taking it as an argument for the radical incapacity of the 
instrument, but to take it rather as a warning to improve an imperfect 
faculty by cultivation, and not to spoil it by abuse.  Much may be done 
by orderliness, by strict truthfulness, by careful discrimination of 
facts from fancies, or prejudices, or desires, and by distinguishing 
when it is that we clearly remember, and when it is that we are 
perplexed.  Any ordinary man would feel that his life was safe if it 
were simply staked on his correctness in enumerating one hundred facts 
of memory at choice: while he would feel great alarm if the one hundred 
facts were assigned by another, and belonged just to the region where 
memory began to grow shadowy.  A third hundred of events might be 
assigned which would simply make him despair.  Therefore, a real power 
with limitations -- such is the description of human memory.</P> 

<P>4. What inclines some people to speak ill of memory as a faculty, is 
the very great and striking variety of its abnormal conditions.  
Diseased or declining state of mind often shows its beginnings by the 
manifestation of injury done to the power of remembrance.  A man's 
consciousness may be split up into two or more almost completely 
isolated series, which cannot be brought into union with each other. A 
person lays in a stock of knowledge duringa number of years, then he 
has a sickness, which leaves him under the necessity to begin the 
learning process over again; next, he may suddenly relapse into his 
first mental condition, and after that, alternate between the two 
states.  Again, a patient may forget all the words beginning with 
certain letters, or the whole of one language; or he may recognize the 
spoken, but no longer the written word, though he sees it.  Thus memory 
may fail in departments. Others again more and more lose the 
discrimination between things remembered and things only fancied.  All 
which proves, indeed, how frail and liable to frustration is memory, 
depending as it does on the preservation of very complex organic 
conditions: but as long as a man keeps his mental sanity, he can take 
account of his pathological state, and make allowances for recognized 
flaws in memory. Some have bravely doiae this with success under 
painful circumstances.  Cases of aphasia furnish occasionally good 
illustrations.  But unfortunately with disease of the memory there 
often goes a general disease of the reason; and then the victim is no 
longer fit to serve as a standard man, from whom to take the measure of 
the human memory.  He cannot become even to himself a disproof of that 
faculty; for such disproof must always fall into the old vicious circle 
of disbelieving a faculty in reliance upon the faculty -- a process not 
so feasible as setting a thief to catch a thief.</P> 

<P>5. The subject of memory receives further light from a comparison 
with the faculty of anticipation, to which it is sometimes too closely 
likened.  Apart from extraordinary processes of foresight, which do not 
concern us, there is no faculty of immediate anticipation corresponding 
to what may be called immediate memory.  Such a faculty would be quite 
unaccountable, whereas of memory an account can be given.  Impressions 
abide till positively effaced even in material things: and we are ready 
to expect that impressions should abide also in the faculties of 
knowledge.  Moreover, the impressions of knowledge were received in a 
certain order, and of this fact also a trace may fairly be expected to 
remain.  In reliance upon it, we sometimes mentally trace back a fact, 
link after link, in a chain of associations.  What seems immediate 
memory may be something like the instantaneous retracing of these 
steps, or at least of some of them.  But for anticipation we have no 
such mental residua to fall back upon; for the experiences are yet to 
come.  Hence at the very most we can reason out a future event from 
present data, just as we might reason out a past event, which we had 
not perceived as it past, and therefore could not recall by memory.</P> 

<P>6. An incidental use of the fact of memory is, that its inevitable 
admission is fatal to pure empiricism, and to the pretence of rigorous 
idealism never to transcend the fact of present consciousness. For 
first, as we have seen, memory must, at starting, demand an intuitive 
trust in itself, and can never be guaranteed simply by an inference 
from accumulated experiences.  Secondly, to allow that we know any fact 
as really an event of past time, is to give up the idealist dogma that 
no idea can travel beyond its own bounds to an object not itself.  Thus 
our previous conclusions receive incidental confirmation, and the 
theory of adversaries has to submit to one more iaxhibition of 
inconsitency. Faculty is proved to be not simply the product of 
function; only a previously existing faculty can develops itself by 
functioning.  Memory is not the creation of experience, but it 
manifests itself, grows, and is perfected by experience.  And memory, 
whether primitive or highly developed, always transcends the present, 
and refutes the first principle of thorough idealism.</P> 

<P>ADDENDA.</P>

<P>(1) Reid<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> has a passage calculated to give rise to some 
controversy: "I think it appears that memory is an original faculty, 
given us by the Author of our being, of which we can give no account, 
but that so we are made.  The knowledge which I have of things past, by 
my memory, seems to me as unaccountable as an immediate knowledge would 
be of things to come; and I ran give no reason why I should have one 
and not the other, but that such is the will of my Maker." That memory 
is more intelligible than foreknowledge has been already argued in the 
principal text: and against calling knowledge of either past or future, 
<EM>immediate,</EM> Hamilton, after the requirements of his theory, 
enters a protest in a note.  But, leaving these points, we may turn to 
another, and ask in what sense is memory a <EM>peculiar</EM> faculty? 
Here it looks as though a caution were needed against the double 
extreme of making memory too much, and of making it too little 
peculiar.  The intellectual metnorv is one faculty with the intellect, 
and yet it is a special exercise of that faculty,<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup> the peculiarity of 
which should not be overlooked.  Against such oversight Sir H. Holland 
makes the remark:<sup><small><a href="#n_c">{c}</a></small></sup> "We do not gain greatly from these metaphysical 
definitions, which resolve memory altogether into other phenomena of 
mind.  Among modern writers on the subject, Dr. Brown has gone 
furthest, perhaps, to merge this faculty in other functions and names." 
The pith of Brown's doctrines seems to be conveyed in the following 
sentence:<sup><small><a href="#n_d">{d}</a></small></sup> "To be capable of remembering, in short, we must have a 
capacity of the feelings which we term <EM>relations,</EM> and a 
capacity of the feelings which we term <EM>conceptions,</EM> that may 
be the subjects of the relations: but with these two powers no other is 
requisite -- no power of memory distinct from the conception and 
relation which that complex term denotes." The relation he explains to 
be one of priority and of subsequence between concepts.  Hamilton 
agrees with Brown so far as to maintain that memory is quite an 
explicable function of the intelligence; and the precise point needing 
explanation he makes to be the persistence and the recognition of past 
intellectual acts: "I think we can adduce an explanation founded on the 
general analogies of our mental nature."<sup><small><a href="#n_e">{e}</a></small></sup> For the retentive part he 
borrows the account of H. Schmid: "The mind affords in itself the very 
vainly seek in any collateral influences. of retention are indeed so 
natural on <EM>the ground of self-energy</EM> of the mind that we need 
not stop to suppose any special faculty for memory; the conservation of 
the action of the mind being involved in the very conception of its 
power of self-activity.  It is a universal law of nature, that any 
effect endures as long as it is not modified or opposed by any other 
effect.  But mental activity is more than this; it is an energy of the 
selfacting power of a subject one and indivisible; consequently a part 
of the <EM>ego</EM> must be detached or annihilated, if a cognition, 
once existent, be again extinguished.  At most it can be reduced to the 
latent condition." After so accounting for Retention, Hamilton accounts 
for Reproduction or Resuscitation by the laws of Association, which he 
thinks make abundantly clear what was so obscure to the scholastics, 
that Oviedo called it "the greatest mystery of the whole of 
philosophy."<sup><small><a href="#n_f">{f}</a></small></sup> In materialistic phraseology, Dr. Maudsley<sup><small><a href="#n_g">{g}</a></small></sup> describes 
memory as extending analogously throughout organic life: "There is 
memory in every nerve-cell, and indeed in every organic element of the 
body.  The permanent effects of a particular virus on the constitution, 
as that of small-pox, prove that the organic element remembers, for the 
rest of life, certain modifications which it has suffered; the manner 
in which the scar on a child's finger grows as the body grows, evinces 
that the organic element of the part does not forget the impression 
that has been made upon it.  The residua by which our faculties are 
built up are the organic conditions of memory." What Dr. Maudsley 
does not labour to explain is, the passage from organic conditions to 
intellectual memory.</P> 

<P>(2) A continuation of the last quotation will lead (is on to Mr. 
Spencer's theory of memory: "When an organic registration has been 
completely effected, and His function of it has become automatic, we do 
not usually speak of the process as one of memory, because it is 
<EM>entirely unconscious."</EM> The last phrase is disputable: and in 
all cases we must protest against memory being set down as a mere 
transitional stage on the way to bodily automatism.  It is constantly 
the tendency of Mr. Spencer's doctrine to regard the automatic 
adaptation of organism to material environment as the highest goal; and 
all stages in consciousness as so many accidents by the way, to be got 
rid of by higher development.  Such is the tendency of his doctrine on 
Memory:<sup><small><a href="#n_h">{h}</a></small></sup> "So long as the psychical changes are completely automatic, 
memory, as we understand it, cannot exist.  There cannot exist those 
irregular psychical changes seen in the association of ideas.  But 
when, as a consequence of advancing complexity and decreasing frequency 
in the groups of external relations responded to, there arise groups of 
internal relations which are imperfectly organized and fall short of 
automatic regularity, then what we call memory becomes nascent.  Memory 
comes into existence when the involved connexions among psychical 
states render their successions imperfectly automatic.  As fast as 
these connexions, which we form in memory, grow by constant repetition 
to be automatic, they cease to be part of memory.  We do not speak of 
ourselves as recollecting relations which have become organically 
registered.  We recollect those relations only of which the 
registration is incomplete.  No one remembers that the object at which 
he looks has an opposite side; or that a certain modification of the 
visual impression implies a certain distance; or that the thing he sees 
moving about is a live animal.  To ask a man whether he remembers that 
the sun shines, that fire burns, that iron is hard, would be a misuse 
of language." Nevertheless these several items would come under the 
head of memory, as we have defined that term; nor should we admit, that 
"the practised pianist can play while his memory is [wholly] occupied 
with quite other ideas than the memory of the signs before him" -- if 
indeed he is playing from the signs as his guides.  In conclusion Mr. 
Spencer thus describes the transitional character of memory: "Memory 
pertains to that class of psychical states which are <EM>in the process 
of being organized.</EM>  It continues as long as the organizing of 
them continues, and disappears when the organization is complete."</P> 

<P>(3) M. Ribot, whose doctrine, in his volume on <EM>The Diseases of 
Memory,</EM> is that "memory is <EM>per se</EM> a biological fact, by 
accident, a psychological fact," discusses the position of the latent 
results stored up in memory, and waiting to be called into actual use.  
He thinks our best course is to describe these <EM>residua</EM> as 
"functional dispositions," not as in any way conscious acquisitions; 
for "a state of consciousness which is not conscious, a representation 
which is not represented, is a pure <EM>flatus vocis."</EM> Hence he 
asserts "a minimum of conscious memory" in those who "are able to 
rise, dress, take meals regularly, occupy themselves in manual labour, 
play at cards and other games frequently with remarkable skill, while 
preserving neither judgment, will, nor affections." He might in these 
cases allow some degree of judgment and will, over and above pure 
unconscious automatism.</P>
