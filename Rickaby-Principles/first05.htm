<P>Some years ago, what has been briefly laid down about metaphysical 
and physical certitude would have been much more readily taken for 
granted than it will be to-day, when so many are boasting that they 
have changed the prevalent ideas on the subject.  It will be the 
endeavour of this chapter to show that the change is not for the 
better, and to recommend a return to the old way of thinking.</P> 

<P>I. Starting from the examination of metaphysical truth, we must 
carefully guard against a prejudice, with which some seek to discredit 
the cause; the notion, namely, that those who hold some principles to 
be in a real sense <EM>a priori</EM> and beyond mere experience of 
facts, are thereby committed to the assertion of innate ideas.<A 
HREF="#N_2_"><sup><small>{2}</small></sup></A> This is not so.  They allow that all 
human knowledge is started by experience, internal or external; but 
they further contend -- and here they differ from <i>pure empiricists-
</i> that while some truths might have been different, other truths are 
perceived to be founded on absolute necessity, and are therefore valid 
for all places and for all times, nay, even beyond all place and time. 
In the latter case, though our knowledge has its origin in single 
experiences, yet no sooner have the ideas been grasped, than they are 
seen to imply universal principles.</P> 

<P>1. To understand against what manner of teaching we have to contend, 
it will be well to examine the three meanings, which Mr. Huxley,<A 
HREF="#N_3_"><sup><small>{3}</small></sup></A> in his little work on Hume, thinks it 
possible to attach to it necessary truth."</P> 

<P>(a) The first interpretation is founded "on the convention which 
underlies the possibility of intelligible speech, that terms shall 
always have the same meaning." This is what Mr. Bain, an expounder of 
the philosophy which Mr. Huxley substantially adopts, has called "the 
principle of consistency,"<A HREF="#N_4_"><sup><small>{4}</small></sup></A> which he 
thus formulates: "It is a fundamental requisite of reasoning, as well 
as of communication by speech, that what is affirmed in one form of 
words shall be affirmed in another." The need of this rule no one will 
deny, if he wishes to secure intelligible communication between men, 
whose principal means of intercourse is by speech.  But, while needful, 
the rule holds a very secondary place in the philosophy of the subject; 
for, deeper than consistency of speech, is consistency of thought, and 
deeper than any mere consistency of thought is its correspondence to 
the reality of things.  Now this correspondence, neither Mr. Huxley nor 
Mr. Bain attempts to defend; they reject the definition of truth, as 
"conformity of mind to thing," inasmuch as they both proclaim that 
idealism cannot indeed be proved, but neither can it be disproved.</P> 

<P>On the matter of this all-important consistency of thought with 
things Mr. Bain<A HREF="#N_5_"><sup><small>{5}</small></sup></A> has to content 
himself with making three postulates, one for objects of present 
consciousness, another for objects of memory, and a third for objects 
of expectation in the future.  On the first point "we must assume that 
we feel what we do feel; that our sensations and feelings occur as they 
are felt.  Whether or not we call this an irresistible belief, an 
assertion whose opposite is inconceivable, we assume it and proceed 
upon it in all that we do.  Calling its negative unthinkable does not 
constitute any reason for assuming it: we can give no reason better 
than that we do assume it." Secondly, belief in memory is also, and 
more especially, taken as a practically needful assumption for which we 
can assign no reason in justification.  And thirdly, to crown the whole 
work of assumption, and to do away with all solid motive for trust that 
our thoughts represent things, the two first postulates are 
supplemented by a third, and not only supplemented by it, but made in 
some sort to rest on it for support; at least there is a reciprocal 
dependence between the three. " What has uniformly been in the past," 
says the third postulate, "will be in the future; what has never been 
contradicted in any known instance, there being ample means and 
opportunities of search, will always be true." For this postulate, "we 
can give no reason or evidence:" indeed it is "an error to give any 
reason or justification," instead of treating it as "begged from the 
outset." At all events, "if there be a reason it is practical and not 
theoretical theoretically or rationally considered, the postulate" 
involves a hazard peculiar to itself, and any belief as to the future 
which we adopt on its authority is "a perilous leap." Nay, experience 
is even positively against the postulate, testifying to us that "nature 
is not uniform in everyting," by the "establishment of exceptions to 
uniformity." So situated, "we go forth  in a blind faith until we 
receive a check.  Our confidence grows with experience, yet experience 
has only a negative force; it shows us what has never been 
contradicted, and on that we run the risk of going forward on the same 
course." Furthermore the curious fact is noted, that, although without 
justification for itself, "this assumption is ample justification of 
the inductive operation, as a process of real inference.  Without it we 
can do nothing, with it we can do anything."</P> 

<P>The passages thus quoted have an immediate bearing on physical 
truth, in relation to which we shall presently consider them; but they 
have also a connexion with metaphysical truth, on which account they 
have been thus early introduced.  The connexion is this: we are 
speaking of metaphysical truth, another name for which is necessary 
truth.  Now the first meaning assigned by Mr. Huxley to necessary truth 
is "consistency of language." Even if we suppose this consistency of 
language to be backed by a corresponding consistency of thought, we may 
not suppose, without inquiry, that behind the consistency of thought 
there is secured a solid basis of objective reality.  Investigation 
shows us that such foundation is not secured; as well because of Mr. 
Huxley's own assertion that idealism cannot be disproved, as because of 
Mr. Bain's futile attempt to rest the objective reality of thought, for 
past, present, and future, on three postulates, of which he gives a 
most lame account.  They are three postulates in the worst sense of 
question-begging.  We conclude, therefore, that the first of the three 
suggested meanings of necessary truth is quite inadequate.  To repeat 
once more and emphasize the main burden of complaint, the school to 
which Mr. Huxley has attached himself, does not make any provision for 
a knowledge of necessary truth <EM>about things.</EM> Just as Mill 
declares that he cannot extend the principle of contradiction <EM>to 
things</EM> in themselves, nor absolutely make of it more than an 
empirical law of our thought, so Mr. Bain similarly stops short of 
reality. "Were it admissible," he writes, "that a thing could be and 
could not be, <EM>our faculties</EM> would be stultified.  That we 
should <EM>abide by a declaration</EM> once made is indispensable to 
all understanding between man and man.  The law of necessity in this 
sense is not the <EM>law of things,</EM> but an unavoidable 
accompaniment of the <EM>use of speech."</EM> So explained, the law is 
quite empty of reality.</P> 

<P>Yet inadequate as it is, Mr. Bain does not allow it its full force.  
He mentions as being outside the range of consistency in speech or of 
"truths of implication," the axioms that "things equal to the same 
thing are equal to one another," and that "the sums of equals are 
equals; "also the principle that "every event must have a cause." 
These several propositions, he maintains, are reached inductively, are 
"not necessary," and "may be denied without self-contradiction." So 
much for necessary truth when described in Mr. Huxley's words, as "the 
convention underlying the possibility of intelligible speech, that 
terms shall always have the same meaning."</P> 

<P>(b) Let us try the second interpretation of necessary truths; now 
they are "propositions the negation of which implies the dissolution of 
some association, memory, or expectation, which is in fact 
indissoluble." Fastening on the word "association" we have one of the 
terms round which so much of the present controversy gathers; nor is 
it possible intelligently to conduct the discussion unless we 
understand the large part played in the philosophy of our English 
empiricists by association. In this matter Mr. Huxley often follows so 
closely the footsteps of Mill, that it is better at once to recur to 
the more original author, though Hume most deserves to be called the 
prime offender .<A HREF="#N_6_"><sup><small>{6}</small></sup></A></P> 

<P>Mill, however, is not such an out-and-out associationist as it 
might, from some of his utterances, appear.  It is true that not only 
in intellectual processes, but even in volitional, he attributes very 
much to association.  Denying free will, and yet clinging to what might 
easily be taken as a remnant of the belief in freedom, after a manner 
which it puzzles even his friend, Mr. Bain, to regard as other than an 
inconsistency,<A HREF="#N_7_"><sup><small>{7}</small></sup></A> he was alarmed, at one 
period of his life, lest his early educators should not have formed in 
him associations of right conduct sufficiently strong to keep him 
always on the line of rectitude.  But it is on the intellectual side of 
association that we are at present considering his views; and here he 
distinctly departs from his father's teaching, that judgment is mere 
association.<A HREF="#N_8_"><sup><small>{8}</small></sup></A> <P> He declares that 
belief is a new element of a special kind, though he nowhere goes so 
far, as does Mr. Bain, in the assertion of spontaneous beliefs, 
exceeding all warrant for their formation.  According to Mr. Bain:<A 
HREF="#N_9_"><sup><small>{9}</small></sup></A> "it may be granted that contact with 
actual things is one of the sources of belief, but it is not the only 
nor the greatest source. Indeed so considerable are the other sources 
as to reduce this seemingly preponderating consideration to comparative 
insignificance." Mill rather adheres to the view, that in producing 
belief the force of association is at least preponderant, as will be 
manifest in instances now to be adduced.<A 
HREF="#N_10_"><sup><small>{10}</small></sup></A></P> 

<P>He divides indissoluble associations into those which we cannot so 
much as conceive to be reversible, and those which he fancies he can 
conceive to be reversible; but not even the former will he pronounce 
absolutely irreversible.  For "it is <EM>questionable,</EM>" he holds, 
"if there are any natural inconceivabilities, or if anything is 
inconceivable to us for any other reason, than because nature does not 
afford us the combinations necessary to make it conceivable." More 
strongly still, passing from the phrase, "questionable," to "can only 
be," he says, "If we have any associations which are in practice 
indissoluble, it <EM>can only be</EM> because the conditions of our 
existence deny us the experience which would be capable of dissolving 
them."</P> 

<P>After such declarations we are not surprised to find how ready Mill 
is to allow the possibility of dissolution in associations which, be 
says, are to us at present, not alterable in any form that we can 
conceive.  Apparently forgetful of his admission that judgments are 
more than associations of ideas, he takes, as test cases, the three 
primary principles of identity, contradiction, and excluded middle; and 
about them he avers,<A HREF="#N_11_"><sup><small>{11}</small></sup></A> "I readily 
admit that these three principles are universally true of all 
phenomena.  I also admit, that if there are any inherent necessities of 
thought, these are such.  I express myself in this qualified manner, 
because whoever is aware how artificially modifiable, the creatures of 
circumstance, and alterable by circumstances, most of the supposed 
necessities of thought are, (though real necessities to a given person 
at a given time), will hesitate to affirm of any such necessities that 
they are an original part of our mental constitution.  Whether the 
three so-called fundamental laws are laws of thought by the native 
structure of the mind, or merely because we perceive them to be 
universally true of observed phenomena, I will not positively decide; 
but they are laws of thought now and invincibly so.  They may or may 
not be capable of alteration by experience, but the conditions of our 
existence deny us the experience which would be required to alter 
them." This passage is the plain negation of all certitude; for if with 
regard to such self-evident truths as that "whatever is, is," and that 
"whatever is, cannot at the same time, and under the same respect, not 
be," we are unable to rely upon our clear mental insight when it tells 
us that these axioms are true for all intelligence and beyond all 
possibility of alteration; then we never can have any really solid 
foundation for a firm assent.  Certitude even ceases to have a 
meaning.</P> 

<P>To pass now to those metaphysical truths which Mr. Mill thinks to be 
conceivably alterable, under conditions of experience other than what 
this world affords; we will take his assertion, that to beings 
differently situated square-circle might be as rational as sweet-circle 
is to us.  His argument is, that Just as to us the sensations sweet and 
circular may be derived together from one object, so to persons of 
another constitution, or in other surroundings, the sensations of 
square and circular might be derived together from one object.  It is a 
revelation of the thorough unsoundness of Mill's philosophy, when he 
thus confounds sensations with intellectual perception of universal 
truths.  So long as he looks only to chance association of sensations, 
he may fancy that any combination of these is possible; but if he 
would look to the mind's insight into the proposition, "a square 
cannot be circular," he would see that it included the truism, "a 
square cannot be not square:" for incontrovertibly that which consists 
of curved lines is not square, and a circle is wholly curvilinear.  
Mill proclaims very loudly against Hamilton that what is self-
contradictory cannot be sound philosophy: let him take his words home 
to himself.</P> 

<P>Another example he borrows from a barrister, and it is to this 
effect.  Two and two might make five; for example, it would do so in 
any region in which, when two and two things were put together, a fifth 
always "interloped." Really the argument seems childish, for the fifth 
object would never appear without a sufficient cause; and even though 
the inhabitants of the strange land never could discover what the cause 
was, at least they would rationally infer its existence, and never 
could form the judgment, "two and two make five." Yet Mr. Huxley has 
accepted the suggestion, and gravely told an American audience, "every 
candid thinker will admit that there may be a world in which two and 
two do not make four, and in which two straight lines enclose a space." 
If so, neither "candid" thought, nor any other kind of thought, has 
much intrinsic value.</P> 

<P>From the same barrister Mill, whom Mr. Huxley follows obsequiously, 
shows how two straight lines may be judged to enclose a space.  Writing 
lately in the <EM>Nineteenth Century</EM> against the Duke of Argyll, 
Mr. Huxley is inconsistent with his earlier view; for he lays it down 
"that omnipotence itself could not make a triangular circle." But let 
us go to the more original fount of wisdom, the barrister, "Imagine," 
says the learned counsel for the non-necessary truth of mathematical 
axioms,<A HREF="#N_12_"><sup><small>{12}</small></sup></A> "a man who has never had 
experience of straight lines through any sense whatever, suddenly 
placed upon a railway, stretching out in a straight line in each 
direction.  He would see the rails, which had been the first straight 
lines he had ever seen, apparently meeting, or at least tending to 
meet, at the horizon. He would thus infer, in the absence of other 
experience, that they actually did enclose a space when produced far 
enough.  Experience alone could undeceive him." Far more faults could 
be found with this piece of sophistry, which many grave writers 
patronize, than it is worth while to enumerate; suffice it to say, 
briefly, that in the supposed case a man, ignorant of perspective, 
erroneously judges from appearances two lines, which really are 
parallel, to be convergent: but he never judges that parallel lines 
can converge, for the notion parallel is nowhere shown to have entered 
his head.  Here the barrister's random shot misses its mark utterly.  
No man, without secretly changing the meaning of his words, could 
intelligently say parallel lines, if prolonged, may meet.  Even one of 
the empiricist school, Mr. Bain, has the wisdom to depart from his 
colleagues in this particular instance: "that two straight lines 
cannot enclose a space," he confesses, "is implicated in the very 
essence of straightness, as defined by mathematicians: to deny it would 
be a contradiction." It is against the convention, to which Mr. Huxley 
is a party, that terms should keep the same meaning.</P> 

<P> The case of the barrister may be put in the form of question and 
answer. <EM>Q.</EM "How may we reverse the apparently irreversible 
judgment, that parallel lines can never meet?" <EM> A.</EM> "By making 
a mistake, and fancying two lines to be convergent, which really are 
parallel." This is not a satisfactory conclusion.  The view might have 
been given more speciously; but in its most specious form it would be 
dissolved by the words which Mill uses against Mansel: "I take my stand 
on the acknowledged principle of logic and morality, that when we mean 
different things,"<i>e.g.,</i> parallel and convergent, "we have no 
right to call them by the same name." <A 
HREF="#N_13_"><sup><small>{13}</small></sup></A></P> 

<P>The result of an examination into Mill's conceived alteration in 
what most people call necessary truths of mathematics, is to show the 
futility of his suggestions, and to convince us that there is no need 
to abandon the old views.  Neither are we more inclined to believe 
Professor Clifford, in his solemn assurances, that while for the 
present our laws of geometry are, perhaps, only approximately true, for 
the future we cannot guarantee them to be even approximations.  The 
necessity we continue to assert for geometric truths, we assert also 
for all other truth which shows itself to the mind to be evidently 
unalterable: it must be judged by the clear insight we have into the 
terms and their connexion, not by a fanciful theory, which derives all 
knowledge from the chance combination of sense-impressions, with the 
surmise that there is no assignable limit to the modes in which such 
combinations could be altered; that all judgment is the effect of 
association, and that all associations are possibly variable.</P> 

<P>(c) Mr.  Huxley's third sense given to necessary truth is that it 
signifies" facts of immediate consciousness" -- "our sensations," he 
says elsewhere, "our pleasures and our pains, and the relations of 
these, make up the sum total of the elements of positive unquestionable 
knowledge." He does not exactly mean that there is no other knowledge: 
but that no other is beyond a question.  Against the sufficiency of 
this view it has to be urged, that facts of consciousness are in 
themselves contingent, not necessary: and that what we regard as our 
chief necessary truths, though knowable to us only through facts of 
consciousness, are universal principles, not specially limited to facts 
of consciousness.</P> 

<P>Moreover, facts of consciousness, as accounted for by the empiricist 
school, are made to appear in anything but the guise of necessary 
truths; rather they are reduced to a position of great confusion and 
uncertainty. Truism as it may appear to be, when we say "what we feel 
we feel," yet empiricism manages to obscure this act of self-
consciousness. Mr. Bain, as we have seen, makes the matter one of a 
postulate for which no reason can be given.  Mr. Spencer<A 
HREF="#N_14_"><sup><small>{14}</small></sup></A> declares that "a thing cannot at the 
same instant be both subject and object of thought," that "no man is 
conscious of what he <EM>is,</EM> but only of what he <EM>was</EM> a 
moment before; "man is not conscious of his present, but only of his 
immediately past state; man holds in memory what he never held in 
immediate perception. In the same spirit M. Comte had written: "In 
order to observe your intellect you must pause from activity; yet it is 
this very activity you want to observe." If you cannot effect the 
pause, you cannot observe, and if you effect it, there is nothing to 
observe." Which words Dr. Maudsley<A HREF="#N_15_"><sup><small>{15}</small></sup></A> 
approves, and supports them by the principle that "to persist in one 
state of consciousness would be really to be unconscious: consciousness 
is awakened by the transition from one physical or mental state to 
another."</P> 

<P>We have not yet arrived at the stage for discussing consciousness, 
but the passages quoted are to our point, because they show, that 
unsatisfactory as it is itself to take "necessary truth" to mean "facts 
of consciousness," the school of empiricists double that 
unsatisfactoriness by the difficulties they throw in the way of all 
consciousness.  On this ground alone Mr. Huxley, if he were true to his 
authorities, as he need not be, would be disqualified from saying "we 
have seen clearly and distinctly, and in a manner which admits of no 
doubt, that all our knowledge is knowledge of states of consciousness." 
Yet this is his assertion: and it agrees with his third meaning of 
<EM>necessary</EM> truth, which, at best, is quite insufficient.</P> 

<P>Three descriptions of necessary truth having been passed in review 
and found wanting, it remains that we argue in behalf of that fuller 
sense of necessity which undoubtedly is required, if man's position as 
a genuinely intelligent being is to be vindicated.</P> 

<P>2.  Our argument shall begin from admissions made by adversaries, 
who, when thrown off their guard, speak not according to the exigencies 
of a false theory about associated ideas, but according to the 
intellectual insight which is theirs by nature.</P> 

<P>(a) If no truth can with certainty be shown to be more than a <EM>de 
facto</EM> association under present experience, it ought to be 
impossible to arrive at any element of <EM>absolute</EM> morality.  Yet 
adversaries do make it a point of absolute morality that truth itself 
is, at all costs, to be held sacred.  Whereas they ought always to say 
what Mr. Leslie Stephen says at least once,<A 
HREF="#N_16_"><sup><small>{16}</small></sup></A> namely, that "if in some planet lying 
were as essential to human welfare as truthfulness is in this world, 
falsehood may be there a cardinal virtue; "nevertheless they do say 
with Mr. Mill just the opposite, that it is better for human kind to 
suffer eternal misery than compromise the truth. The passage<A 
HREF="#N_17_"><sup><small>{17}</small></sup></A> is well known in which Mill declares, 
that rather than call any being good, who is not good in the human 
meaning of the word, he would go down for ever into Hell. Hereby he 
asserts a very strong conviction as to the absoluteness of moral truth, 
not only in this world but in the next, not only in man but in the 
Supreme Being. This is more than we could logically expect from a man 
who professed to doubt, whether a changed experience might not render 
inconceivable thins now regarded as conceivable, and, on the other 
hand, render conceivable things now regarded as inconceivable; or, 
after Mill's own phraseology, dissociate the ideas of any present 
conceivability, and associate the ideas of any present 
inconceivability.  If truth were indeed at its root, what mere 
empiricism makes it to be, it is impossible to show a valid reason why 
man should, in all cases, rather die than lie. Mr. Huxley can affirm 
"that the search after truth, and truth only, ennobles the searcher, 
and leaves no doubt that his life, at any, rate, is worth living." Only 
when you give truth, and goodness their foundation in some absolute 
necessary worth, are you able to show that between truth and untruth, 
right and wrong, the difference, is as between Heaven and Hell.  No 
wonder, then, Mr. Bain is puzzled, on his own principles, to justify a 
worship of truth for truth's sake, and has to apply the theory about 
means getting mistaken for ends.<A HREF="#N_18_"><sup><small>{18}</small></sup></A> 
"Associations," he pleads, "transfer the interest of an end of pursuit 
to the means.  The regard for truth is, and ought to be, an all-
powerful sentiment, from its being entwined in a thousand ways with the 
welfare of human society.  We are not surprised if an element, of such 
importance as a means, should often be regarded as an absolute end to 
be pursued irrespective of consequences, whether near or remote." 
Nevertheless, a more correct insight occasionally asserts itself in the 
mind of the empiricist, and be becomes, in relation to his own dull 
principles, <EM>splendide mendax.</EM></P> 

<P>(b)But not only in the matter of morals, where it may be suggested 
that grandness of sentiment may have gained a momentary victory over 
clear thought, but even in the region of cold clear thought itself, 
adversaries are betrayed into admissions of metaphysical principles 
strictly so called.  It is all very well to refuse attention to these 
admissions.  Mr. Leslie Stephen, in answer to very forcible 
difficulties urged by Mr. Balfour, may reply with lordly disdain, as he 
has done in <i>Mind,</i> that he simply steps over, metaphysical 
puzzles, and so reaches science; he may own to only one exception: 
believe anything is the same as to disbelieve its contradictory: this 
is all the dogmatism to which I can plead guilty." Well, that one 
article only is fatal to empiricism, and has proved too much for Mill's 
powers of defence: besides, there are many other articles of which 
Mr.Stephen can be "proved guilty," even though he does not "plead 
guilty."</P> 

<P>All that is needful is, to employ a means of conviction, which the 
late Dr.Ward used to employ with good effect.<A 
HREF="#N_19_"><sup><small>{19}</small></sup></A> He used to urge upon men of the 
school of Hume, that really, throughout their polemics, they were 
relying on the absoluteness of those very metaphysical principles, 
which they were labouring to prove only relative and contingent.  To 
verify the force of this contention we have only to take up their 
books.  It is not without an assumption of his own absolute knowledge 
that Comte can say, "There is only one absolute principle, namely, 
that there is nothing absolute."</P> 

<P>Hume himself, in a sense which requires more sifting than can be 
afforded here, refuses to admit the validity of the inference, whereby, 
from past changes in nature, belief in the constancy of the same 
sequences for the future is derived.  Why this refusal? Because he sees 
in the inference none of the demonstrative force that he acknowledges 
in the sciences of quantity and number, in which "reason is incapable 
of variation; the conclusions which it draws from considering one 
circle are the same which it would form upon surveying all the circles 
in the universe." On the other hand, empirical investigations are 
declared to want this invariability: "All inferences from experience, 
therefore, are effects of custom, not of reason ." <A 
HREF="#N_20_"><sup><small>{20}</small></sup></A> He distinguishes a mathematical from 
a physical truth by saying that the former does not allow of any 
contradiction, whereas the latter might not be what <EM>de facto</EM> 
it is; and so far as facts are merely empirical, it is absurd to talk 
of them as demonstrable. He claims that his theory of causality upsets 
the common principle, that every event must have a cause, because upon 
this theory "we may easily conceive that there is no <EM>absolute and 
metaphysical;</EM> <EM>necessity</EM> that every beginning of existence 
should be attended with such an object."<A 
HREF="#N_21_"><sup><small>{21}</small></sup></A> Thus he requires for the 
establishment of a principle of human certitude, "absolute and 
metaphysical necessity," and rejects a most widely received axiom on 
the supposed defect of such necessity. Here is the tacit confession 
that every conclusion valid in reason must be drawn in virtue of some 
"absolute metaphysical necessity." Explicitly asked to make this 
confession, the empiricist would demur: implicitly, in the very act of 
using his reason, he yields his acknowledgment.  He is constantly 
recurring to the phrases, "I see no necessary connexion," "I see no 
compelling evidence," "The conclusion is not inevitable," and on these 
pleas he considers himself justified in stopping short at a probable 
assent.</P> 

<P>It takes up too much space to transpose long quotations into these 
pages; but whoever wants a further illustration of how empiricists 
tacitly suppose metaphysical principles, need only read Mill's Preface 
to his <EM>Logic.</EM> There it will be seen how absolute is the 
character which Mill gives to logic; how carefully he submits all 
sciences, under pain of becoming unscientific, to the jurisdiction of 
the logician; how little he thinks of repudiating all necessity, or 
allowing for a possible alteration of experiences.  Only two sentences 
shall be quoted, in which the noteworthy words shall be italicized. 
"Logic points out what relations <i>must</i> subsist between the data 
and <EM>whatever can be</EM> concluded from them: between the proof and 
<EM>anything which it can prove.</EM>  If there be any such 
indispensable relations, and if <EM>those can be precisely determined, 
every particular branch of science,</EM> as well as <EM>every 
individual in</EM> the guidance of his conduct, is <EM>bound</EM> to 
conform to these relations under penalty of making false inferences, 
which are <EM>not grounded on the reality of things."</EM></P> 

<P>Of course it may be possible to trim these utterances into some sort 
of conformity with Mill's metaphysics; but the process is one of mere 
torture on a Procustean bed.</P> 

<P>3. It remains that we ground certitude upon its only satisfactory 
basis of metaphysical principles, which have absolute necessity and 
universal validity.  We can know metaphysical truths in the strict 
sense of the phrase.</P> 

<P>A modern paradox is the denial by adversaries at once of necessity, 
of free will, and of chance. Hume<A HREF="#N_22_"><sup><small>{22}</small></sup></A> 
had led the way, saying, "Necessity is something that exists in the 
mind, not in objects." "Necessity," Mr. Huxley repeats, is but "a 
shadow of the mind's throwing," an "intruder" that he "anathematizes;"
he claims to be a necessarian without being a fatalist, because he 
regards necessity as having only a logical existence.  Free will he 
equally repudiates, and he would laugh at chance as a factor in 
scientific calculations. Necessity, free will, chance -- these he does 
not recognize ; but he adds, "Fact I know and law I know."</P> 

<P>One point, at any rate, is asserted here; and while we cannot agree 
with Mr. Huxley's denials, fortunately we can agree with his assertion 
of fact and law. We yield to none in putting fact and law at the 
foundation of all things, so far as God may be called (not indeed in 
the etymological sense) the first Great Fact, giving the law to all 
others. The substitution asked for in <i>Faust</i>, whereby "in the 
beginning was the Word," should give place to "in the beginning was 
the deed," has no point at all as directed against the reality of the 
Creator.</P> 

<P>Next, what sort of a fact was this first fact? Not a chance fact, 
for that has no meaning: nor a free fact, for that is absurd in a first 
origin: but a necessary fact, for that alone will satisfy the 
requirements of sound reason.  Necessity being thus at the root of all 
being, is therefore at the root of all truth ; the existence of the 
primal Being, its nature, its whole condition -- this was the one great 
original necessity. Hume,<A HREF="#N_23_"><sup><small>{23}</small></sup></A> 
therefore, is too sweeping in his assertion, when he says, that of no 
fact is the contradictory inconceivable. It is inconceivable that the 
prime fact of existence should be reversible.</P> 

<P>Here, therefore, is the foundation of metaphysical truth: here is 
"fact and law," but bound up with the anathematized "necessity." For 
the nature of necessary Being inevitably gives rise to certain 
necessary truths about being, on account of the identity between truth 
and being. But now observe, as a matter of great importance, that for 
the individual investigation it is not requisite, that before 
perceiving a truth to be of metaphysical necessity, he should have set 
before himself the origin of all things and of all truth, as in the 
sketch just given.  It is enough that the intellect should clearly 
contemplate some of the easier first principles, and judge by evidence 
and insight. "The same thing cannot be and not be, at the same time and 
under the same aspect:" "nothing can begin to be without a sufficient 
reason for its commencement:" "things, equal to the same thing, are 
equal to one another." The simple understanding of these terms and of 
their interrelations is metaphysical certitude, necessary, universal, 
beyond all contingency.  Evidence and insight -- these are the things 
to insist upon, in opposition to the mere <EM>de facto</EM> experiences 
and associations, which Mill, at times, makes all in all. To set these 
latter in the place of supremacy is to yield to an utter scepticism, 
such as will presently be shown to be impossible.  Mr. Huxley is fully 
aware into what an abyss the denial of insight into necessary objective 
truth, and the substitution of mere empiricism, inevitably conduct the 
speculator, who has logic and courage to follow his principles to their 
conclusions.  Accepting Hume's principles, he boldly proclaims<sup><small><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></small></sup>that 
"for any demonstration which can be given to the contrary, the 
collection of perceptions which make up our consciousness may be only 
phantasmagoric generated by the <EM>ego</EM>, unfolding its successive 
scenes on the background of the abyss of nothingness."</P> 

<P>Is the reader willing to go this length? If not, the only remedy is 
to keep a firm foothold on metaphysical certitude; for assuredly there 
is error in the supposition of Mr. Carveth Read, that "to doubt the 
possibility of necessary cognitions is not the same thing as to doubt 
the possibility of actual and objective cognitions." If there are no 
"necessary cognitions," that is, cognitions of necessary truth, then 
there is no fixed basis whereon to found the cognition of contingent 
facts or laws.  Some support must be found for the contingent outside 
of contingency, that is, in necessity.</P> 

<P>It is satisfactory to find a confirmation of the doctrine, that 
metaphysical truth is to be judged by evidence and insight, rather than 
on a theory of empirical associations, in the better utterances of Mill 
himself. Already we have seen that he asserts "belief" to be something 
different from association of ideas.  If he had seen only this much, he 
had seen enough to warn him against judging the validity of the three 
great axioms of metaphysics -- the principles of Identity, 
Contradiction, and Excluded Middle<A HREF="#n_25"><sup><small>{25}</small></sup></a> -- almost solely on the ground of 
conceivability as regulated by association. But Mill goes beyond the 
mere proposition that belief is more than association: for when 
speaking of evidence in relation to belief, he says:<sup><small><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></small></sup> "Inasmuch as 
the meaning of the word evidence is supposed to be something which, 
when laid before the mind, induces it to believe; to demand evidence 
when the belief is insured by the mind's own laws, is supposed to be 
appealing to the intellect against the intellect. But this, I 
apprehend, is a misunderstanding of the nature of evidence. By 
evidence is not meant anything and everything which produces belief.  
There are many things which generate belief besides evidence. <EM>A 
mere strong association of ideas</EM> often causes a belief so intense, 
as to be unshakable by experience or argument.  Evidence is not that 
which the mind does or must yield to, but that to which it ought to 
yield, namely, that by yielding to which its belief is kept in 
conformity to fact.  To say that belief suffices for its own 
justification, is denying the existence of an outward standard, 
conformity of opinion to which constitutes its truth. A mere 
disposition to believe, even if supposed instinctive, is no guarantee 
for the truth of the thing believed." Agreeing with Mill that the mind 
must conform in its true beliefs to an outward standard, we have 
defended metaphysical truth on the ground that it has an outward 
standard in the objective evidence, which the mind perceives, and to 
which it conforms. But of evidence we must treat hereafter.</P> 

<P>II. In passing from metaphysical to physical certitude, the 
transition is between two categories of Being, which Aristotle 
recognized under the names of necessary Being and contingent Being 
(<b>tou ex anagk&ecirc;s huparkein</b> and <b>tou endechesthai 
huparkein</b>).
The ultimate possibilities of all things created are settled 
by metaphysical necessity, following inevitably, as is shown in 
Ontology, from the nature of the by First Being and His powers of 
creation. Yet when the possibilities come to be actualized in the 
world, there belongs to them a lower order of necessity, which we call 
physical, and which, resting upon conditions that need not have been 
fulfilled, may be called contingent. Contingent necessity may seem a 
paradox, but it is easily explainable. Physical necessity rests upon a 
double contingency, on God's free election to create at all, and on His 
further free election of one out of many eligible plans of creation.  
The <EM>de facto</EM> elements, their number and original collocations, 
were matters of choice. But the system once established has intrinsic 
laws of action, which according to some theories of matter could not be 
altered without putting a different set of substances in place of the 
actually existent, while other theories would not so rigorously 
identify mode of action with substance. These laws we can partially 
detect, not by intuition or <EM>a priori</EM> argument, but by arguing 
back from effects to causes.</P> 

<P>1. The sum total of created things and of their forces is regarded 
as a constant: so that we speak of physical nature as of a fixed 
aggregate, not liable to increase or diminution of parts.  If it be 
asked how this fact can be known, the answer is, that our only natural 
means of discovery is by very wide observation.  Undoubtedly God, if He 
had liked, could have put us into a world where He frequently took away 
old agencies and introduced new, or suddenly altered previous 
arrangements. Or He could have framed a world, different parts of which 
were composed of quite diverse elements, such even that no inter-action 
could go on between some parts and others.  No one need have been very 
much surprised, bad an old opinion proved to be true, and bad the 
heavenly bodies shown, that they rejected all kindredship with the 
physical constituents of our planet.  Yet it would have been 
inconsistent with the essential Wisdom to have placed us in a creation, 
where the variability was so great, as to reduce us to absolute 
bewilderment, or to the position of dwellers in chaos, who could not 
familiarize themselves with their outer surroundings, or so accommodate 
themselves to their circumstances as to be able to continue the life of 
the race. There must then be some uniformity of nature,and it becomes 
urgent upon us to distinguish different uses of that phrase.</P> 

<P>(a) The most radical meaning of all, is that like agencies, under 
like circumstances, will always have like effects. Messrs. Bain and 
Pollock, not admitting the principle of efficient causality, have 
agreed in maintaining, that for anything we can know to the contrary, 
the mere lapse of time may make an alteration. On this point Lewes 
rightly took the other side, and held, though in an imperfect manner, 
that the circumstance of time, as such, is irrelevant, and that the 
principle is an <EM>a priori</EM> truth. Time, as time, never alters 
anything; but alteration is due to the activities, which, in time, 
produce their effects. What is relevant as regards time is this: 
created things continue in their communicated existence only by virtue 
of the constantly supplied support of Him who originally gave them 
being: and on this score, a natural object has no intrinsic power of 
prolonging its own duration. But when we speak of like agencies having 
like effects, the presupposition is that they are preserved in their 
proper natures; else we could not call them like.  The non-theistic 
school of philosophers will not approve of the mention of creation and 
conservation; but they must remember that questions of this sort 
necessarily drive us back into the theory of first origins; and that 
those who simply have no view as to the beginning of things, or as to 
the production of existant objects, must allow that they have a great 
and fatal deficit in their philosophy.</P> 

<P>This something which is wanting shows itself in many curious 
opinions about a means of origination, which ultimately may be reduced 
to the illogical idea of chance. As theism is true, no apology is 
needed for using it to settle points, which otherwise cannot rationally 
be discussed: and we must consider the agnostic position as quite 
unfitted to give its occupiers the safety, which they vainly imagine 
that they possess in the word, <EM>ignoramus.</EM> On the plea that 
they do not know anything to the contrary, they speak of it as a 
possibility, that there might be a world where things spring into, and 
out of existence, as it were spontaneously and capriciously: in which 
case, as Professor Clifford suggested, it would be worth while trying 
to settle what objects were given to such vagaries; whether, for 
instance, buttons were prone to these pranks. The great mystery, what 
becomes of all the old pins, might be more hopefully investigated on 
the hypothesis of sudden ceasings to be. Wild as the notion may seem, 
it is contained in Mr. Bain's<sup><small><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></small></sup>solemn announcement: "That every event 
must be preceded by some other event is obviously not necessary in the 
sense of implication, and the opposite is not self-contradictory.  
There is nothing to prevent us from conceiving an isolated event. Any 
difficulty that we might have in conceiving something to arise out of 
nothing, is due to our experience being all the other way. If it were 
not for habit there could be no serious obstacle to our conceiving the 
opposite state of things to every event being chained to some other 
events, Thus to abolish the principle of efficient causality is to take 
away all genuine science; for in that case there could be no proof that 
uniformities would continue, not even, strictly, that they had existed 
in the past. To guard against this chaotic result, we state the first 
sense of nature's uniformity to be the <EM>a priori</EM> self-evident 
principle, that from like causes, under like circumstances, uniformly 
constant results may be relied upon to follow.</P> 

<P>(b)The second sense of uniformity in nature is <EM>a 
posteriori,</EM> as the first was <EM>a priori.</EM> The first says, 
like agencies, under like conditions, will always have like effects; 
the second says, the sum total of physical agencies in the world is 
constant, neither matter nor its inherent forces suffer increase or 
decrease. This is not going as far as the Law of Conservation of 
Energy; but it is its foundation. The asserted uniformity cannot be 
verified in every separate detail; but it is what all observation of 
nature goes to establish.</P> 

<P>(c)The third sense of uniformity is again a matter of observation.  
It is noticeable that in some climates, for instance, the dry and the 
rainy seasons are calculable almost to a nicety: whereas here in 
England, which has according to an American authority, "no climate but 
only specimens of all sorts of weather," we take it as a matter of no 
surprise that fair or wet weather should predominate in any of the four 
seasons. The laws are fixed for us, as for the most regular of 
climates; but whereas, for the latter, they result in obvious 
regularity, for us they result in apparent irregularity.  Speaking of 
the uniformity of nature from this point of view, we have evidences of 
it in many recurrent phenomena, such as day and night, the seasons of 
the year, planetary conjunctions, secular variations like those 
effected by the precession of equinoxes, and lastly successive stages 
of animal life in one and the same. individual. Thus the universe on 
which we dwell, in many of its phenomena, does not, but in many also 
does, present us with detectable periodicities; and these we may fairly 
call <EM>uniformities of Nature.</EM></P> 

<P>But another physical universe is possible, where such recurrences 
would be so rare as to give to an observer, having the average life of 
man, no token of regularity. Uniformity would be there in the first 
sense of the word and in the second; matter and force would be 
constant, physical causes would keep rigorously to their laws; still 
the combinations would be so various as to present an appearance of 
chaos. Elementary laws would result in complicated effects, without 
discernible law of complication. Compared with such a possible world, 
ours we call uniform, because of its many observed recurrences.</P> 

<P>2. If we hold by the several truths just enunciated, we shall be 
saved from the sad lot of empiricists, who have to take refuge in "a 
primitive instinct," or in an "unaccountable adaptation of our beliefs 
by the Creator of our faculties," in order to explain, why it is that 
we rely on our past experiences for knowing what nature will do in the 
future.<sup><small><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></small></sup> Our reliance is rationally grounded on the three 
uniformities above described; one <EM>a priori</EM> and quite 
necessary, the other two <EM>a posteriori</EM> and necessary only 
inasmuch as God cannot fail to give to His works their strict 
requisites for the purpose they are meant to serve. This is theism if 
you like' introduced into philosophy; but theism is itself philosophic, 
and so necessary to philosophy, that if you deny it, you have no stable 
basis for physical truth, but at best a hope, logically quite 
unjustifiable, that the course of things will go on with that 
orderliness, which hitherto you have known it to observe. Further than 
this the non-theist cannot advance: for him any time there may be 
"chaos come again." Mill<sup><small><a href="#n_29">{29}</a></small></sup> is quite open in his avowal that on his 
principles, there may be a planet where "events succeed one another at 
random, without any fixed law," and that "it is perfectly possible to 
imagine the present order of the universe brought to an end, and a 
chaos succeeding, where there is no fixed succession of events, and the 
past gives no assurance of the future." In the same spirit and on the 
same principles Mr. Huxley writes in his <EM>American Lectures:</EM> 
"Though we are quite certain about the constancy of nature at present, 
it by no means follows that we are justified in expanding this 
generalization into the past, and in denying absolutely that there may 
have been a time when events did not follow a fixed order, when the 
relations of cause and effect were not fixed and definite, and when 
external agencies interfered in the general course of nature." There 
are statements here fatal to physical science, which can be preserved 
from extinction only by holding on to principles we are advocating, not 
indeed as anything new, but as the common possession of unsophisticated 
mankind.</P> 

<P>3.Wishing now to maintain the power of the human mind to reach 
physical certitude, we much need a distinction between two classes of 
efforts  -- those more ambitious efforts which often do not get beyond 
probability, and those humbler efforts which often reach full 
assurance. Against the absolute certainty of the sun's rising tomorrow 
it may be urged, that even though our system were clearly explained as 
to its planetary movements, still there would remain elements of doubt.  
For instance, we are told that the whole system is travelling in space; 
that the stars are closing up behind our course and opening out before; 
and that it is not quite sure that we shall not come suddenly under 
perturbing influences as yet unsuspected. It is admitted that them 
danger is a <i>minimum</i>, as far as we can calculate: but 
nevertheless there is a particle of undispelled doubt, nay some would 
say far more than a particle. Well, give this theoretical doubt its 
due, and, after all that astronomers and even theologians who speak of 
providence, can bring forward to comfort the timid, suppose it to 
remain undissipated.  The sun's movements are not the easiest of our 
physical inquiries. and it is precisely in our more complicated or our 
abstruser questions, as for instance whether the law of the inverse 
squares applies to gravity at minutest distances, that we may allow 
some truth to Mr. Huxley's declaration, "that our widest and safest 
generalizations are simply statements of the highest degree of 
probability."</P> 

<P>But take the simpler case of letting a stone drop to the earth.  
Arrange your own circumstances, break off a piece of sandstone from a 
quarry which you know well; get out of the way of all scientific 
apparatus, on to the open plain, and there, relaxing your hold upon the 
stone, leave it to nature's forces. You may not know all about gravity; 
there may be many forces acting on the stone about which you are 
ignorant: still you have physical certainty that the stone will not 
stand in mid air. As to the possible unknown forces, you have 
sufficient experience to warrant the conclusion about what they will 
<i>not</i> do-that they will <i>not</i> arrest the fall to the ground.  
It is a physical certitude of this simple nature that we often want for 
purposes of daily life, and sometimes for such religious purpose as 
verifying a miracle. Unless he had in mind the grade of certitude, 
about which I spoke before, and of which his example would give a good 
illustration, it is hard to see what De Morgan, in his <EM>Logic,</EM> 
can have wanted to show, when he wrote:<sup><small><a href="#n_30">{30}</a></small></sup> "I know that a stone 
<i>will</i> fall to the ground when I let it go, and I know that a 
square number must (in a given case) be equal to the sum of odd 
numbers: and though when I think, I become sensible of more assurance 
for the second than for the first, yet it is only on reflexion that I 
can distinguish the certainty from what comes so near to it." Is not 
this only another case of playing fast and loose with the word 
certainty? "I know that the stone will fall:" and yet the knowledge is 
only what "comes near to certainty," but is distinguished from it.  We 
should say that the certainty from which it is distinguished is not 
certainty in general, but that special sort of certitude which carries 
with it <EM>must</EM> instead of <EM>will</EM> or <EM>is;</EM> or that 
one is metaphysical, the other physical certainty.  But both are full 
certainties.</P> 

<P>4. There still remains the objection, what about miracles? If God 
can interfere at any moment with the course of nature, how determine in 
any case that He does not interfere? In reply we must say that the 
objection is not insuperable: in many instances we may be sure there is 
no miraculous, interposition.  For God has sufficiently shown us, by 
experience and by reasons of fitness, that miracles do not come in 
capriciously, so as to make the whole of life a puzzle to us: but they 
are wrought only, occasionally and for proportionate ends.</P> 

<P>Nec Deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus Inciderit.</P>

<P>Surely there are trivial circumstances in our lives, where we can 
see that there is no adequate occasion for miracle, and where, in 
consequence, we may know that none will be performed.  And as for 
Descartes' fear of a mischievous demon, who may be always tricking us, 
it belongs to God's providence to hold in check the limited powers 
which even the evil spirits, by natural endowment, possess.</P> 

<P>Some may object to Divine providence as a factor introduced into 
philosophical considerations.  But a factor it is in the world's 
physical course, and as St. Augustine long ago pointed out, if we 
neglect this factor, then <EM>actum est de philosophia.</EM> Those, 
however, who exaggerate the possibility of Divine interference seem not 
at all to realize what they are committed to, when, because of it, they 
have taken up the position, that never can we be quite certain of a 
physical fact or sequence.  They fail to observe that they cannot at 
once hold this position, and at the same time claim to be sure that 
there are, or have been, a city of London, a man called Napoleon, and a 
plague known as the Black Death. When they speak of miracles as always 
possible, they forget all the ridiculous interferences, which, on their 
theory, it 's not incredible that God may work; for if no physical 
event is safe from the suspicion of miracle, then it is not certain 
that tomorrow all men will not be walking on their hands, all corn 
will not become poison, and all sand will not turn into gold. Really 
with the fullest allowance for large possibilities in the way of 
unsuspected miracles and for the inadequacy of our knowledge about any 
one of nature's ultimate laws, still we must not go the length of 
conceding our complete inability, to be certain of physical truths, 
past and present.  As to the future, if any one likes to fancy an 
instantaneous arrival of the end of the world, it would be difficult to 
plead anything against him, except from the signs given in Scripture 
about what is to precede the consummation of all things terrestrial. 
and from the fact, that the immediate future of our universe is, to 
some degree, calculable from its known present.  Conjectures are even 
made about the natural causes of a final period to be put to the order 
which now prevails.</P> 

<P><CENTER>ADDENDA.</CENTER>
</P>

<P>(1) That the exaggerated manner in which some urge the association 
theory, leads to the denial of all immutable truth, cannot but be known 
to any one at all acquainted with our English writers on philosophy.  
To take a single specimen, we have Dr. Maudsley<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> telling us to give 
up as hopeless "infinite, absolute truth." If he means only that we 
cannot grasp truth in all its infinity, he is obviously right; but he 
means more and worse.  He says, "Because each one has a certain 
specific nature as a human being, and because the external nature, in 
relation with which each one exists, is the same: therefore are 
inevitably formed certain general associations which cannot without 
great difficulty, or anywise, be dissociated.  Such are what have been 
described as the general laws of association, in which all men agree --
those of cause and effect, of contiguity in time and space, of 
resemblance, of contrast; in all which ways, it is true, one idea may 
follow another, though also probably in other ways. The universality 
which is supposed to belong to the ideas of cause and effect, of the 
uniformity of nature, of time and space, has been supposed to betray an 
origin beyond experience," that is, beyond mere empirical association. 
"Nevertheless, it is hard to conceive how men, formed and placed as 
they are, could have failed to acquire them, <EM>and still more 
difficult to conceive, how they could even have been supposed to have 
any meaning outside human exberience, to have an absolute, not a 
relative truth."</EM> Thus the law of causality is true for men, with a 
mere relative truth, and has no absolute value for all intelligence; a 
theory which robs science of all its glory, and is made worse by what 
follows. "The belief in the uniformity of the laws of nature is a 
belief which is developed of necessity in the mind, in accordance with 
the laws of the nature, of which mind is a part and product.  The 
uniformity of nature becomes conscious of itself, so to speak, in the 
mind of man: for in man, a part of nature and developing according to 
nature's laws, nature attains to self-consciousness.  To declare that a 
theory is conceivable, is to declare that conception has limits based 
upon experience, not to limit the possibilities of nature." All thought 
thus becomes a sort of <EM>de facto</EM> pattern, worked out in the 
mind of man by his surroundings: whilst other surroundings would have 
worked out quite a different pattern, and no pattern has any absolute 
value.  What is true of mere sensations is thus extended to the 
highest acts of intellect. Hence no fixed system of philosophy is 
possible; at best we can but have ideas suitable to our own age and 
<EM>Zeit-Geist,</EM> or spirit of the time. As Mr. Pollock<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup> puts it, 
"Science makes it plainer, day by day, that there is no such thing as a 
fixed equilibrium, either in the world without or in the world within: 
so it becomes plain that the genuine and durable triumphs of philosophy 
are not in systems but in ideas." But what is the value of ideas, which 
condemn each other by refusing to fit into consistent system? Let us 
take the instance of a few "ideas," which have been framed to represent 
our condition as regards the knowledge of nature.

<P>(2)Reid<sup><small><a href="#n_c">{c}</a></small></sup> has told us, far more piously than wisely, God hath 
implanted in our mind an original principle by which we believe the 
continuance of the course of nature, and of those connexions which we 
have observed in the past.  Antecedent to all reason we have an 
anticipation that there is a fixed and steady course of nature." 
Brown,<sup><small><a href="#n_d">{d}</a></small></sup> in default of a belief in real causality, is also obliged to 
fall back on Providence, appealing to the instinctive tendency 
wherewith God has endowed us in view of the circumstances in which we 
are placed." Mr. Bain<sup><small><a href="#n_e">{e}</a></small></sup> leaves out all mention of a bountiful 
Provider, whose existence he would consider unverifiable, and points 
simply to blind tendency.  He asserts that there is a primitive 
credulity, which every uncontradicted experience has on its side," "an 
initial believing impulse of the mind, which errs on the side of excess, 
and which, if nothing has happened to check it in a particular case, 
will be found strong enough for anything." Neither Mr. Bain's theory, 
nor any philosophy of Hume's school, will give to physical science a 
rational basis: and this is a serious consideration for those who may 
feel tempted to grasp at the simplicity of experience and association, 
when put forward as explanations of well-nigh everything that can be 
rationally explained.</P> 

<P>(3) With metaphysical and physical truth alike overthrown, with the 
very principle of contradiction undermined, it is no wonder that we 
have philosophies in which contradictions abound.</P> 

<P>Nor can the work of clearly pointing out these contradictions, be 
looked upon as a useless sort of criticism.  Take the case of Mill for 
instance.  Mr. Jevons, disgusted with the task of having to teach his 
system for several years, entered a protest by publishing a list of the 
inconsistencies which he had come across, many of which are undoubtedly 
to be found in the author.  This is a most legitimate and effective way 
to discredit a philosophically discreditable writer, and serves the 
very good purpose of doing something to check the spread of ruinous 
principles. It is, then, somewhat difficult to see the force of the 
objections made by the Editor of <EM>Mind,</EM> when he says that 
Mill's inconsistencies are known; that no one is exactly a follower of 
Mill; and that those who admire him most and owe him most, take leave 
to dissent from him when they think good.  All this may be true: and 
yet, since Mill has given to Hume's philosophy about as fair an 
appearance as any other author has succeeded in imparting to it, the 
labour is a worthy one, to show in detail the essentially contradictory 
character of a bad system.  A list of Mill's inconsequences and 
contradictions should be kept as permanently on the bookshelves as his 
own works -- the antidote ever by the side of the poison.  Perhaps it 
was because he rose up among a people who had long neglected 
philosophy, and whom he helped to rouse into inquisitiveness on the 
subject, that Mill's undoubted cleverness met with so much success in 
the propagation of irrational principles.  But there is no reason why 
Englishmen should go on worshipping the god of unreason: especially 
when they remember Mill's wretched education from earliest years.  He 
is always to be spoken of more in pity than in anger; but when we read 
Mr. J. Morley's extravagant praises of him, and profuse acknowledgments 
of indebtedness to him as a teacher, while we understand better Mr. 
Morley's position, we also understand the need of having the hollowness 
of the teacher sounded and made known to all.<sup><small><a href="#n_f">{f}</a></small></sup></P>

<P><A NAME="N_7_">{7}</a> His theory is, that though man's conduct is 
rigorously determined by character and circumstances, yet man can do 
something to improve his character. Modified fatalism holds that our 
actions are determined by our will, our will by our desires, and our 
desires by the joint influence of the motives presented to us and of 
our individual character; but that our character having been made for 
us and not by us, we are not responsible for it, nor for the actions it 
leads to, and should in vain attempt to alter them.  <EM>The true 
doctrine</EM> maintains that not only our conduct, but our character, 
is in part amenable to our will; that we can by employing proper means 
improve our character." -- Examination, c. xxvi. p. 516. (2nd Ed.)</p>
