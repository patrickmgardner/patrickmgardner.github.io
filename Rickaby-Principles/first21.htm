<P>1. WHILE it is clear that the veracity of the senses, as has been 
shown before, forms part of the problem of our belief in the testimony 
of other men, it is equally clear that it is not the whole problem. 
There is something special about our trust in the word of another, 
which calls for a separate treatment. Hence it is unsatisfactory to 
find the elder Mill arguing thus:<sup><small><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></small></sup> "Belief in events or real 
existences has two foundations; first, our experience, and second, the 
testimony of others.  When we begin, however, to look at the second of 
these foundations more closely, it soon appears that it is not in 
reality distinct from the first.  For what is testimony? It is in 
itself an event.  When, there. fore, we believe anything in consequence 
of testmony, weonly believe one event in consequence of another. But 
this is the general account of our belief in events." Yes; and still 
things which agreein Being events may differ in being events of a 
specifically different order; and such is the case in the present 
instance. Manifestly belief in testimony has its peculiar nature, not a 
little important to a Christian, whose religion is historic and rests 
on historic foundations.</P> 

<P>2. Belief in testimony is natural, and natural on its two sides.  
First, man being intelligent, is apt to discover truth, and, apart from 
extrinsic reasons, is inclined to declare the truth as he knows it.  
Even the downright liar, according to James Mill's estimate, for one 
lie that he utters tells a thousand truths. Secondly, on the side of 
the recipient, he has been accustomed from childhood to depend on the 
information of his elders, and from his knowledge of himself judges 
what he is to expect from others. Mr. Bain, therefore, seems to be 
throwing a needless mystery over the case, when he talks of "a 
primitive credulity in the mind," from which he derives "belief in 
testimony," and which he: describes as "a primitive disposition to 
receive all testimony," till sad experience of deception gradually 
modifies the too ready instinct.  Of course, children are simple and 
credulous, but the appeal to "a primitive instinct" is hardly necessary 
to account for the fact.<sup><small><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>3. That testimony, oral and written, is a source, and an abundant 
source of certitude, cannot, in concrete cases, be plausibly gainsaid.  
The whole plausibility lies in keeping to the abstract, and is. well 
illustrated by Mr. Balfour's ingenious arguments against the theoretic 
trustworthiness of any old manuscripts.<sup><small><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></small></sup> The author's subtleties are 
telling enough, when the concrete circumstances are not at hand whereby 
to put a rude stop to their light and airy play; but take them out of 
the air, weight them with the load of terrestrial facts, and 
straightway their frolics are over.  It is simply demonstrable by way 
of testimony, that Alexander of Macedon and Julius Caesar were 
successful leaders of armies, and produced notable effects in the 
world's history; also that Demosthenes and Cicero were powerful in 
speech; and that there was a writer of comedies called Aristophanes, 
specimens of whose work we yet have.  In the history of our own country 
there have certainly been a Roman, and an Anglo-Saxon, and a Norman 
conquest.  For in regard to these events we may be sure of the 
knowledge and of the veracity of the witnesses, just the two requisites 
for trustworthy testimony.  And if we test the sceptical generalities 
which are urged against the possibility of any historic certainty, by 
instances like the above, the adversary will produce little 
impression, when he argues, in the abstract, that the occurrence of a 
fact is only one out of several equally possible causes for its 
assertion; that a tradition grows weaker with every transmission 
through a new channel; that the original force of an authority becomes 
disamong its countless recorders, and that each witness being 
fallible, so are any number of witnesses.  Without further argument, 
therefore, we may take the proposition as established, that certitude 
in reliance on testimony may often be had.  When had, it is what we 
have called "moral certitude," in the sense that it reposes on a know 
ledge of the actions of moral agents, or men, in speaking the truth.  
It is real certitude, though not metaphysical; and so Mr. Mahaffy, in 
the Introduction to his <EM>Prolegomena to Ancient History,</EM> is
granting all we contend for, when he declares that historic belief may 
be beyond all doubt, but can never reach mathematical demonstration.  
If it is beyond all doubt, it is quite certain, and that is all for 
which we stipulate.</P> 

<P>4. Unquestionably a number of independent witnesses are often 
required to establish an event; and the special force of the argument 
then lies, not only in the fact that it is unlikely so many together 
should be guilty of a lie, but also in the impossibility that they 
should have succeeded in lying consistently. When a number of witnesses 
are agreed to perjure themselves in a court of law, about the only safe 
way to secure uniformity in the narration of a fictitious event of 
some complexity, is to eract the scene before the eyes and ears of all.  
Very impossible is it that without any previous arrangements writers 
should independently tell one intricate story; and sometimes it can be 
proved, not only that there was no prior conspiracy, but also that such 
conspiracy would have been ineffectual, because of other modes of 
information outside the circle of the presumable conspirators.  Busy 
with these considerations about the value of a multiplicity of 
vouchers, sometimes people are led into the assertion that never can a 
single witness be a sufficient authority for a certain assent.  Without 
entering into detail, we may protest that this declaration, in its 
universality, is a calumny against human nature.</P> 

<P>5. So much in general about belief on testimony; in particular some 
cautions are needed for the guidance of our judgment -- cautions which 
may be illustrated, but not exhausted, in the following 
observations:</P> 

<P>(a) We must distinguish the quite feasible in history, from the 
partially feasible.  If the historian binds himself to put down nothing 
but what he can fairly conclude to be beyond all controversy, he will 
be very meagre and dry.  He will be cut off from most of what is called 
the philosophy of history, and reduced almost to the position of a 
chronicler.  Such safe but jejune writing is liked neither by authors 
nor by readers; and hence it becomes necessary for both sides to 
recognize that large portions of history, as now composed, do not rise 
above probability.  Consequently counter probabilities must be 
treated with the respect due to them, not as though one party were 
entitled to the monopoly of conjectural interpretation.  Even the most 
probable account need not be the truest.  It is to be feared that not 
sufficient allowance is made for the essentially problematic character 
of much historical writing.  Hence, just as when we were considering 
physical certitude, we distinguished the safer from the more 
venturesome attempts, so in considering moral certitude we must make a 
like distinction. And in the category of the venturesome we should 
place most books which treat of comparative mythology, comparative 
religion, the origin of social institutions, and such matters, in which 
documents are scarce or obscure, or written in a language ill 
understood, while inferences are often marked more by ingenuity than 
conclusiveness.  Sobriety of judgment in these subjects characterizes 
rather the dispassionate reader of rival systems than enthusiastic 
partisans.</P> 

<P>(b) Another thing to note is how wonderfully a man with a point of 
view, especially if he is selective in his incidents, or even 
inventive, can make facts conform to that point of view, without at all 
proving that he is right.  A glaring instance is Draper's <EM>Conflict 
of Science and Religion,</EM> a book which it is well to quote as an 
example, because it has had a wide circulation, and has done much harm 
to the cause of truth.  Draper may have been quite honest, as honest as 
he declares himself to have been; but at any rate he has a wonderful 
power of making his point of view tell upon facts, instead of <EM>vice 
versa.</EM> Let me illustrate this power by a single but fairly chosen 
instance, which, in this country, will be more easily appreciated than 
other ecclesiastical events which have been not less misrepresented. 
Fancy a man, who in the light of modern research, could categorically 
assert without the shadow of a qualification that, "a conviction that 
public celibacy is private wickedness <EM>mainly</EM> determined the 
laity, as well as the government in England, to suppress the 
monasteries." This example will do to illustrate the force of "point of 
view," and its influence on Mr. Draper's credibility.</P> 

<P>(c) A third danger is excessive reliance on what are called 
"internal evidences," a danger all the greater when a critic insists on 
carrying his own times and circumstances into distant and differently 
situated ages.  The full bearings of this remark can be appreciated 
only by the actual examination of cases in point; but at least its 
general drift may be made intelligible.  Where we are abstract, 
metaphysical, or literal, other people have been concrete, pictorial, 
or metaphorical.  The unity, the sequence, ,and the completeness which 
we, as a matter of course, try to give to a historical narrative, they 
never dreamt of giving; but they were fragmentary, logically and 
chronologically " non-sequacious," and without pretence to adequacy.  
To mention only one instance out of several, the reticences of the Old 
Testament are many and manifest, especially on points of mere secular 
detail. How garrulous old Herodotus would have been, if he had known as 
much about Egypt, Nineveh, Babylon, and Persia as the sacred writers 
must have known; yet their remarks upon mere manners and 
characteristics are but incidental.  There is no sketching for the sake 
of sketching.  To suppose, then, that sacred history is something other 
than what it is, is to misinterpret it by judging it on a false 
standard.  But upon so burning a question we had better stop short with 
what is obviously only an example by the way, rather than run the risk 
of damaging an important cause, by appearing to state its whole defence 
where no such statement is attempted.</P> 

<P>In profane history, however, we may pursue the line of illustration 
already entered upon.  A great error is committed by supposing old 
authors to have written with that completeness which is expected in our 
days of abundant books, of world-wide intercommunion, of accumulated 
results gathered fronexploration in all fields, of easy means of 
reference to what are pre-eminently works for reference, and of 
recognized canons for literary production. Josephus<sup><small><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></small></sup> was speaking to 
our point when he made the apologetic remark, that it was no new thing 
for one people not to be acquainted with the history of another, "a 
fact true also of Europe, in which about a city so old and warlike as 
Rome, mention is not made either by Herodotus, or Thucydides, or any of 
their contemporaries; only late in the course of events Greece became 
acquainted with Rome." He adds that Greek writers knew little of Gatil 
and Spain.  "How, then," he continues, "is it proper matter of wonder 
that our people also were unknown to many, and that a nation so 
separate, so remote from the sea, living after its own peculiar 
customs, should have given no occasion for writers to make mention of 
its doings?" At least there is a substantial force in this argument; 
and though it was the fate of the Jews to come into very rude contact 
with the great empires of antiquity, Egyptian, Assyrian, Persian, 
Greek, and Roman, yet Tacitus is a glaring example how little an 
intelligent historian may have known about Israel.  And even with 
regard to their own history, the incompleteness of ancient writers is 
further instanced by that want of emphasis or proportion of which 
Cardinal Newman speaks: "Those who are acquainted with the Greek 
historians know well that they, and particularly the greatest and 
severest of them, relate events so simply, calmly, unostentatiously, 
that an ordinary reader does not recognize what events are great, and 
what events are little; and on turning to some modern history in which 
they are commented on, will find to his surprise that a battle or 
treaty, which was despatched in half a line by the Greek author, is 
perhaps a turning point in the whole history, and was certainly known 
by him to be so."</P> 

<P>The result of this otherness of conditions in old times was, that 
occasionally we find just saved from oblivion an event which we should 
preserve in a thousand ways.  In these matters instances are 
everything, and the following instance, as recorded by Sir C. Lyell, in 
his <EM>Principles of Geology,</EM> is much to our purpose.  "The 
younger Pliny, although giving a circumstantial detail of so many 
physical facts, and describing the eruption, the earthquake, and the 
shower of ashes which fell at Stabiae, makes no allusion to the sudden 
overwhelming of two large and populous cities, Herculaneum and Pompeii. 
In explanation of this omission, it has been suggested that his chief 
object was simply to give Tacitus a full account of his uncle's death.  
It is worthy of remark, however, that had the buried cities never been 
discovered, the accounts transmitted to us of their tragical end might 
well have been discredited by the majority, so vague and general are 
the narratives, or so long subsequent to the event." What Pliny had 
strangely omitted nearly failed of being supplied by others, in which 
case his omission might easily have been taken as proof of the 
negative.  Now, let us compare this case with an equally strange 
omission in more recent times, and about a more recent calamity -- an 
omission, however, amply made up for by other sources, because the 
event occurred in modern times.  Spinoza's friend, Oldenburg, was in 
London during the great plague; but, says Dr. Martineau, in his 
<EM>Study of Spinoza,</EM> "when we remember what was passing in the 
streets of London and on the Northern Sea during the September and 
autumn of 1665, it is strange to see how slight a vestige it has left 
on the correspondence of its witnesses or participators.  In the 
plague-stricken city where Oldenburg wrote, ten thousand victims 
perished in a week; but apparently the visitation would have elicited 
no remark, had it not, by the interruption of business, delayed the 
arrival of a book, and suspended the regular meetings of the Royal 
Society!" Had such occasion not caused the mention, and had Oldenburg
remained quite silent about the calamity, we have it, nevertheless, 
preserved for us in numberless other records.  But in ancient times the 
perpetuation of such a fact might depend on a single writer, whose 
works were to be extant in distant time, and he might either fail to 
say anything, or say it so offhandedly, that the event would be either 
not known, or wholly under-estimated.  We are warned, therefore, not to 
rely overmuch on the <EM>argumentum ex silentio,</EM> which some 
critics urge to an extravagant degree, in the case of writers who 
never dreamt of being exhaustive.</P> 

<P>While we are on the subject of the differences between ancient and 
modern historians, the confession may freely be made, that the way in 
which, innocently or fraudulently, forgeries used to be committed, is 
very surprising to us in these modern days, and the fact much perplexes 
that historic truth which we wish to defend as attainable.  Still an 
age which could so accept forgeries was also an age clumsy in the 
formation of them.  D&ouml;llinger instances a stupid attempt to pass off 
some volumes at Rome as of Numa's authorship; they were supposed to 
have been discovered in an old stone coffin, and were written in Greek 
and Latin.  But as paper and Greek prose were evidently articles not so 
readily to be had in Numa's days, the imposture was betrayed.  
Similarly modern criticism has been able to detect certain forgeries, 
though sometimes it has been too keen after a case for exposure.  
Neither is it first of all within modern times that any critical power 
has shown itself among scholars.  The ancients were not all of them and 
altogether fools on the point, as many recorded criticisms of theirs 
remain to prove.  In spite of many. regrettable forgeries, therefore, 
we have a distinguishable history.</P> 

<P>6. It is fashionable, in what claim to be enlightened circles, to 
ridicule Bossuet's historical compendium; but whether he has succeeded 
or not in tracing the providential course throughout the ages, we must 
bear in mind that there is a Providence in history, and even in making 
ascertainable to us certain vital portions of history.  It would have 
been against the Providence of God to have allowed the two connected 
dispensations, Jewish and Christian, such a verisimilitude of historic 
support, had they been really mythical creations; or to have left them 
so dimly recorded that we could not substantially trace out the record.  
For, as one of the Fathers remarks, we might protest, "Lord, if we 
are deceived, Thou hast deceived us;" or on the other hand we might 
say, "Lord, Thou has left us without sufficient light."</P> 

<P>ADDENDA.</P>

<P>(1) As an instance of the endeavour to be overclever in historic 
science, we may take the case of Buckle, who so gloried in his 
imaginary triumph as a philosophic historian.  Borrowing some ideas 
from others, for his conception was not new, he proved to his own 
satisfaction, that militarism must die out with the advance of popular 
power; that wars were made by a small class, who looked to their own 
emolument or honour, but would not be made by the masses, whose 
interests were for peace.  In Europe he fancied that, the popular will 
being dominant, we had ended the age of wars.  The outbreak of the 
Crimean war displeased him, but did not upset his conviction.  He 
pointed to the fact, that the quarrel originated between Russia and 
Turkey, two of the least advanced nations which had a footing in 
Europe.  Littr&eacute;, labouring under a like pleasant delusion, was more 
effectually roused from his dream; for he lived to see, what Buckle 
never saw, a succession of European wars, including the Franco-German, 
in which last grim struggle he had the poignant sense of being on the 
beaten side.  In 1850 he had written: "Peace has been foreseen by 
sociology these last twenty-five years.  Now-a-days sociology foresees 
peace for all the time to come of our present transitional state, at 
the close of which a republican confederation will have united the 
West, and have put a stop to armed contests."<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>In 1878 his comment on the above was: "Would that I could blot out 
those unhappy pages! Scarcely had I prophesied, in my childish 
enthusiasm, that there would be no more military defeats in Europe, but 
political defeats would take their place, than there happened the 
military defeat of Russia in the Crimea, of Austria in Italy, of France 
at Sedan and at Metz, and, quite recently, that of Turkey in the 
Balkans."<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup> Thus poor Littr&eacute; and Buckle were sadly out in their 
calculations; yet, reading their arguments, we find them quite up to 
the average plausibility, such as is to be found in recent theories of 
history and criticism.  The course seems triumphant till it be rudely 
interfered with.  M. Pasteur further tells us of the disappointed 
Littr&eacute;:<sup><small><a href="#n_c">{c}</a></small></sup> "The work published by him in 1879 teems with the blunders 
into which Positivism betrayed him."<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>(2) In his work on the <EM>Transmission of Ancient Books,</EM> 
Mr. Taylor thus speaks of the nature of old historic records: "Many 
instances may be adduced of the most extraordinary silence of 
historians, relative to facts with which they must have been 
acquainted, and which seemed to lie directly in the course of their 
narrative, Important facts are mentioned by no ancient writer, though 
they are unquestionably established by the evidence of existing 
inscriptions, coins, statues, or buildings."</P>
