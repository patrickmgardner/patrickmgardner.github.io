<P>1. So far the claims of reason have been asserted, and put higher 
than this sceptical age is inclined to allow.  It is just that after 
the assertion of the prerogatives of reason, the claims of a superior 
power should be briefly indicated; otherwise a false impression might 
be conveyed as to the all-sufficiency of man's natural lights.</P> 

<P>2. Faith in general is belief on the authority of a speaker; and if 
the speaker is human, so too is the faith; if he is divine, so too is 
the faith, at least in some respect, but not necessarily in the degree 
required for salvation.  For there are arguments convincing to the 
natural reason both as to the fact <EM>that</EM> God has spoken, and as 
to the matter, <EM>what</EM> God has spoken, at least so far as regards 
the substantial parts of His message.  Reason, too, affirms that what 
God says is to be implicitly received.  Now, inasmuch as the revelation 
itself has been supernatural, this acceptance of God's word would be a 
faith founded partly on the supernatural; but it would not be simply 
what we call supernatural faith.  For this further requires that the 
act be elicited by the co-operation of intellect and will, not as left 
to themselves, but as elevated by grace, and as using, for the sole 
motive which enters intrinsically into the very act of faith itself, 
the authority of God.  It follows that what are called <EM>praeambula 
fidei,</EM> are the suitable preparatives for the assent called the act 
of faith; but they neither give to it its formal motive, nor lead by 
mere natural force to its being elicited.  Hence the great error of 
those who are accustomed to regard supernatural faith as the mere 
outcome of reasoning upon the Christian evidences.</P> 

<P>To repeat the same doctrine in other words.  Supernatural faith 
normally presupposes at least some sufficient portion of the arguments 
which apologetics supply, and goes beyond into quite a higher sphere, 
into which the force of the apologetics could never raise it.  In order 
to produce saving faith, grace, with the twofold office of enlightening 
the intellect and impelling the will, must enter into the soul and its 
powers.  The mind so elevated elicits the act of belief.  Thus the 
motive of faith, strictly so-called, is not found in the grounds for 
coming to the reasonable inference that God has revealed a certain 
truth, but in the word of God alone, in the divine authority, in the 
acknowledged omniscience and veracity of God revealing.  " I believe 
this article on the divine word "-- such is the formula expressive of 
the act of divine faith. The presence of grace in this act is not 
usually a matter of direct consciousness: rather it is known by the 
secure trust we have, that God will do what He has promised to do, if 
we honestly endeavour to fulfil the conditions.</P> 

<P>Faith so regarded will no longer be looked upon as a simple matter 
of intellect.  Seeing its supernatural character, its only partial and 
extrinsic dependence on the natural preliminaries, we shall the more 
readily admit that God supplies in the ignorant the defect of 
scientific apologetics; that He sustains the really faithful in their 
conflict with learned infidelity; that the preservation of faith once 
received is no mere matter of examining every fresh objection and 
triumphantly solving it.  Knowing that while reason is somehow at the 
basis of faith, it is not the whole basis -- that it is not simply the 
root out of which faith naturally grows -- we shall have a truer 
estimate of how reason stands to faith as its condition; so that there 
is no faith without reason, and yet reason alone is inadequate to the 
production of faith.</P> 

<P>3.Faith in revelation being as described, it is left for us to 
consider how readily disposed we should be to acquiesce in the 
providential order, that unaided reason should not for us be all in 
all.  A revelation is <EM>a priori</EM> probable.  Its probability is 
suggested by our ignorance, which is only too keenly felt.  For no sane 
man would say, I am so clever, I am above being beholden to the aid of 
a teacher.  When a schoolboy shows no sign that he can be made aware of 
his own ignorance, then, whatever his "sharpness," our hopes for him 
are not great.  Neither should we think very highly of any scientific 
man who had not realized the inadequacy of human science; who did not 
see that, even when we succeed in submitting physical phenomena to 
mathematical calculation, the mathematical aspect is but an aspect, 
and leaves other sides of the truth undiscovered.  Mr. Tyndall 
represents himself as confounded with the vast mysteries left 
undiscovered in the universe, and as asking himself the pertinent 
question, Can it be that there is no Being who understands more about 
things than I do? Now, human ignorance, felt in matters of physical 
science, is a drawback, but does not touch on highest interests; 
whereas human ignorance felt, as the mass of men, when left to their 
natural resources, do feel it, about the very origin and end of their 
existence, certainly touches on highest interests.  Hence it is <EM>a 
priori</EM> probable that the Creator has supplied, by some special 
communication, what He has left imperfect in our means of discovering 
truth for ourselves.  Probably He has made an external revelation the 
complement of inner incompleteness.  Not that we must exaggerate this 
latter defect, and speak as though reason were incapable of finding out 
man's destiny; but taking the bulk of mankind, we are safe in saying, 
that without revelation they have not a sufficiently easy, sure, and 
universally available means of keeping constantly in mind how they 
stand related to life, death, and after-death. Circumstances thus show 
the likelihood of a revelation.</P> 

<P>4. As taught by the revelation which we have actually received, we 
know that in view of the strictly supernatural end to which <EM>de 
facto</EM> we are destined, revelation is not merely a matter of more 
convenient provision, but an absolute necessity.  Not natural 
knowledge, but supernatural faith is the sole assent of intellect, 
which is now available for salvation; or, as St. Paul expresses it, 
<EM>Sine fide impossible es placere Deo --"</EM> without faith it is 
impossible to please God."</P> 

<P>5. Reason, not faith, has been the main point of defence in the 
foregoing pages; but in defending reason we have been promoting the 
cause of faith.  Vilify reason, and you will never make good the title 
of faith to be honoured; but secure to reason her due position, and she 
will be able to add to her own dignity by defending the dignity of 
faith, and claiming to herself her due participation in this higher 
light.</P> 

<P> Such being the final use of that part of Philosophy which it has 
been the purpose of this book to explain, it is manifest how no one, 
who has a sense of responsibility, can offer to the public a treatise 
on this subject without feeling how much his work is "stuff of the 
conscience." It is an awful crime, in the spirit of levity, to meddle 
with the springs of human knowledge; to spread abroad heedlessly 
doctrines that may be infinitely mischievous; to allow an itching for 
novelty, or the display of ingenuity, to make the pen write what the 
sober judgment cannot acquit of rashness; or to permit fear of being 
thought old-fashioned and mediaeval, to dictate the adoption of what is 
new-fashioned and modern, and worldly-wise, yet all the time is an 
outrage, more or less conscious, upon the sacred cause of truth.</P>
