<center><h2>Preface.</h2></center><p><hr>

<P>A few words will be enough to put exactly before the reader the 
object at which the present volume aims.  A well-known criticism on the 
Aristotelian Logic is the complaint, that it provides for the 
consistency of thought with thought, but not for the consistency of 
thought with things; that it secures right processes upon given or 
assumed materials, but does not guarantee the materials upon which the 
processes are conducted.  To supply the want thus indicated, several 
modern logicians have curtailed or omitted portions of the old Logic, 
and added new chapters, of which the following headings may serve as 
specimens, taken from Mr. Bain's work: "Uniformity and Laws of 
Nature," "Elimination of Cause and Effect," "Experimental Methods," 
"Frustration of the Methods," "Chance and its Eliminations," 
"Secondary Laws, Empirical and Derivative," "Explanation of Nature," 
"Hypotheses," "Classification," "Logic of Mathematics," "Logic of 
Physics," "Logic of Chemistry," "Logic of Biology," "Logic of 
Rhetoric," "Logic of Politics," "Logic of Medicine." These titles show 
the kind of addition that now-a-days is asked, beyond the simple bill 
of fare found in the Aldrich who satisfied the students of a past 
generation, and to many even afforded more than they wanted.</P> 

<P>It is unfortunate that those who in this country were, perhaps, the 
loudest in their clamours that logic should take account of the reality 
which hitherto it had seemed to neglect, should have embraced a system 
of philosophy which is fatal to firm belief in any reality beyond 
thought itself.  Messrs. Mill and Bain assuredly have not directly 
tended to take men out of idealism, and make them realists.  Yet the 
former was explicit enough in his demands:<A 
HREF="#N_1_"><sup><small>{1}</small></sup></A> "I conceive it to be true, that Logic 
is not the theory of thought as thought, but of valid thought: not of 
thinking, but of correct thinking. . . . In no case can the thinking be 
valid unless the concepts, judgments, and conclusions resulting from it 
are conformable to fact.  And in no case can we satisfy ourselves that 
they are so by looking merely at the relations of one part of the train 
of thought with another.  We must ascend to the original sources, the 
presentations of experience, and examine the train of thought in 
relation to these."</P> 

<P>Little as the modern representatives of the Schoolmen are satisfied, 
either with the spirit of Mr. Mill's demand, or with the mode of his 
own response to it, they have deemed it well worth while, not indeed to 
change the old Logic, but to add to it a new book.  Pure Logic remains 
substantially what it was, and is justified in its position.  It 
assumes, as all other sciences do and must, that human thought has, in 
general, objective reality; and on this most legitimate assumption it 
proceeds to lay down the laws of orderly, consistent thinking.  The 
newly added part of Logic, often called Material, Applied or Critical, 
takes for its special purpose to defend the objective reality of 
thought.  It is thus an assertion of a form of realism, as against 
idealism, and is called in this book the <EM>Philosophy of Certitude.</EM> 
For the whole question comes to this: what reasonable account can 
be given of man's claim to have real certainty about things?  What are 
the ultimate grounds for holding, that man may regard his knowledge 
about objects as undoubtedly correct?  Scientifically to draw out the 
account here demanded is a work appositely described by the title, 
<EM>The First Principles of Knowledge</EM>.</P> 

<P>An endeavour has been made throughout these pages, while stating the 
sound, traditional principles of certitude, to bring them into constant 
contact with the antagonist principles, more particularly with the 
principles of Hume and the pure empirics.  It is not true that the only 
possible philosophy is a history of the opinions which, at various 
times, have prevailed;  but it is true, that the modern spirit will not 
be satisfied without a statement of how controversies stand on 
questions which are notoriously disputed.  The truth as made manifest 
in conflict, is what has to be exhibited: and this necessity, whether 
exactly desirable or not, must stand as explanation or apology to 
those, whose own special tastes might prompt them to desire a simple 
exposition of scholastic doctrine apart from the encumbrance of adverse 
systems.  Scholasticism must now be militant, and that, not only with a 
view to outsiders, but with a view to retaining its own clients, who 
cannot fail to come across much in modern literature, for the 
understanding and the consequent rejection of which some direct 
preparation is needful.</P> 

<P>Readers not already familiar with the questions here discussed, 
would do well at first to leave alone the notes which are printed in 
smaller type, and concentrate attention on the positive doctrine, the 
importance of which must be judged, not by the length of its statement, 
but by the weight of the words. The matter is eminently one which is 
best conveyed in a few precise sentences, the full import of which must 
be mastered by leisurely consideration.</P>
