The Charge of Discord (or at least of want of co-operation) between
Natural and Philosophic Certitude.</h2></center><p><hr>

<OL>

<LI>The asserted antagonism of Philosophy to Natural Certitude. (a) A 
thorough-going antagonism. (b) A partial antagonism.</P></LI> 

<LI>The asserted want of co-operation between spontaneous and 
systematic thought, or between natural and scientific reasoning, can be 
explained by the consideration of certain facts. (a) When theory is not 
yet as wide as all the conditions of a problem, it is no disrespect to 
theory to supplement it by rule of thumb: theory co-operates to the 
extent of its powers, and there stops short. (b) By long habit the mind 
abridges its processes, and does not always follow out every logical 
step in an inference. (c) The spontaneous processes of the mind may 
very well be more successful than the reflex on many occasions.</LI>

<LI>Limits within which the doctrine in the chapter is to be 
taken.</LI>

<P>THE philosopher's prying into his own mind has been compared to 
Aladdin's prying into his wonderful lamp; before, it lighted him to the 
attainment of all things needful, afterwards, it became unserviceable.  
This accusation is urged by different authors in varying extent; with 
some the charge is one of downright antagonism between philosophy and 
natural certitude, with others it is one of want of co-operation or of 
harmony.</P> 

<P>1. The asserters of antagonism must be subdivided into those who 
represent the opposition to be complete, and those who represent it to 
be partial.</P> 

<P>(a)  That philosophy utterly discredits the validity of ordinary 
reasoning is what we should gather from, some of the stronger 
expressions used by Jouffroy.  For example, he declares that reason 
"absolutely affirms human belief to be without a motive; it is by 
instinct that a man believes, and by reason that he doubts.  When 
reason reflects upon its own work, scepticism is the inevitable 
result." This is but a repetition of Bayle, who declared that reason 
can not bear to turn her own light upon herself; that philosophic 
reflexion undoes all the mind's previous work and makes her a Penelope, 
unweaving at night what she had woven by day.</P> 

<P>Against so blank a scepticism, as resulting from a philosophic 
examination of man's position in regard to knowledge, it will be the 
business of the next chapter to contend; so at present we may pass on 
to the milder subdivision of the first impeachment.</P> 

<P>(b)  At any rate, it is argued, philosophy is only in partial 
agreement with common certitude, and there is a partial disagreement.  
Speaking of the sceptic doubts which philosophy can throw on scientific 
principles, and of the practical progress of science in spite of these 
apparently demonstrated difficulties, Mr. A. Sidgwick thinks we must 
acquiesce in a certain disregard of what seems philosophically valid 
argument. "In the presence of all the acts of useful self-deception, 
which help to make the world go round, may we not admit that theory and 
practice cannot as yet be safely presumed to coincide?"</P> 

<P>A writer who has done good service to Catholic philosophy in this 
country, Dr. Ward, has more than once expressed an opinion which bears 
on the present discussion.  Though a great stickler for logic, yet it 
was his deliberate view, "that there are several truths of vital 
importance, which are reasonably accepted as certain only on implied 
grounds of assurance, which have not as yet been scientifically 
analyzed; nay, of which, perhaps, the scientific analysis transcends 
the power of the human soul."</P> 

<P>Out of the two authors quoted, we may frame a sort of common 
objection in this shape: Practical logic, as it may be called, 
outstrips the school logic, sometimes bidding us go safely forward, 
where the latter posts up a decided "No Road." Thus, at least, there is 
occasional opposition.</P> 

<P>In reply, let us begin by distinguishing between what one individual 
and what another individual can do: as also between what any unaided 
individual may accomplish and what the collective force of human 
intellect may accomplish.  The individual unaccustomed to the analysis 
of his thoughts may often have a genuine certitude, for which, 
nevertheless, he is unable to render a philosophic account, but for 
which another individual, trained in philosophy, would furnish a 
sufficient analysis.  Next, beyond the individual, we have to take into 
account the accumulated labours of the race, especially of its ablest 
members working in conjunction upon the chief problems which present 
themselves for human investigation.  What now are we to say of a 
professed certitude, which both the individual man and collective 
humanity have failed to support by producible motives? The certitude 
is, by supposition, merely a natural act: yet nowhere among men can 
immediate or mediate evidences be brought forward adequate to its 
defence.  It has to be accepted on a general feeling that it is right; 
but how or why it is right, no one can exactly declare.  Where is the 
instance of a certitude about a "vital truth" in this predicament? If 
such there be, about the only rational ground on which it could be 
defended would be by saying, that the race of men being rational, such 
a common consent could not have been produced except by some rational 
motives, however inscrutable some of these might be. But we may doubt 
whether any human certitude is so circumstanced. It seems more correct 
to maintain, that for every certitude which is not self-evident, there 
is a producible analysis of motives. A perfect analysis may not be 
forthcoming, but at least a sufficient explanation may be offered. If 
the truth is self-evident, the self-evidence is the motive of belief; 
otherwise there must be some inferential evidence.  At any rate, for a 
real certitude of the natural order, there must always be producible 
evidence.</P> 

<P>By far the most pertinent reply to alleged instances of the 
difficulty we are now considering is to point out that each of the 
given examples is not a case of full certitude, but only one of high 
probability, quite sufficient to act upon.  We have no fear that the 
sun will not rise to-morrow; yet those items which are wanting to the 
full logical proof of coming events are just what cause our legitimate 
assent to fall a little below absolute.  If the sun did not rise 
tomorrow, we should be ready to confess "Well, after all we had not 
absolute demonstration." Thus, as a fact, valid assent is not in excess 
of the premisses, and practical logic does not really carry the 
intelligence further than speculative logic would allow.  In all cases 
genuine certitude is strictly proportionate to its known motives.</P>

<P>2. Without being opposite, paths may not coincide; and when 
opposition, between the ways along which spontaneous reasoning and 
philosophy respectively travel to a conclusion, is not asserted, at 
least divergence is affirmed. "Experience," says Balmez, in his 
<EM>Fundamental Philosophy,</EM> "has shown our understanding to be 
guided by no one of the considerations made by philosophers; its assent 
when it is accompanied by the greatest certainty, is a spontaneous 
process of natural instinct, not of logical combinations or 
ratiocinations." The difficulty here raised may be answered by a few 
explanations as to facts.</P> 

<P>(a) When the theoretical account of a case is obviously such as does 
not take in all the circumstances, then, in practice, we do not follow 
out the mere dictate of theory.  A mathematical formula tells how to 
point a cannon so as exactly to hit a mark, on the supposition that 
there is no atmospheric resistance, and no deflecting power in a 
whirlwind that is blowing.  What divergence is there between theory and 
practice, if the gunner calculates by rule of thumb the disturbing 
elements, which are too unsettled to allow of theoretic determination?  
Again, a physician has a scientific theory about the effect of a 
certain drug on a limited set of conditions within the human body: but 
aware that these conditions are complicated by many others, which he 
cannot distinctly formulate, he makes a rough allowance for these last 
on empirical grounds.  Often scientific results are known to be only 
approximative; and scientific men know how to relax the rigour of these 
terms to meet refractory cases.  One reply to Mr. Stallo's attack on 
scientific theory was made precisely on this ground, that physicists 
use "attraction," "fluid," "atom," "potential energy," with a 
recognised elasticity of meaning, for which only the experienced worker 
in science can make due allowances.  This is an acknowledgment that 
science is imperfect, but no acknowledgment that it is not in accord 
with practice: it goes along with practice as far as the length of its 
own tether will permit.  So, too, when it is said that philosophy 
travels one road, common sense another, it should rather be said, that 
philosophy is not co-extensive with all practical discoveries, in many 
of which we know <EM>that</EM> things are, without knowing <EM>how</EM> 
they are.</P> 

<P>(b)  We should be quite unable to get on in life, if on every 
occasion, when we wanted a conclusion, we had to go through, in order, 
all the steps which logically lead up to that conclusion.  By dint of 
habit our mental associations become very nimble, and partly as a 
matter of direct memory, partly by the aid of dimly suggested 
inferences, our course is expedited.  Whereas the full number of steps 
are A, B, C, D, E, we seem to go at once from A to E. Some affirm that 
we do actually pass through B, C, D, but so rapidly as not to advert to 
the fact; others say that A may have become immediately associated in 
memory with E, though originally the intermediate stages had to be 
traversed.  At any rate, the impression left is, that the mind takes 
short cuts to its ends, and that occasionally our conclusions come 
first, and our premisses, if they come at all, follow afterwards.  
Instead of being in the case of Dogberry, when he said, "'Tis already 
proved you are guilty, and it will go nigh to being thought so soon," 
we are in a position of saying, "the conclusion is already drawn, and 
it will go nigh to being proved soon." Something like the strange 
process which Alice heard recommended in Wonderland, seems to belong 
likewise to Plain-man's-land, "sentence first, and verdict 
afterwards."</P> 

<P>The account of the process has already been briefly given, but may 
be repeated with a slight change of words.  The mind has gone through 
much experience, and much labour, in arranging its contents. Many 
immediate judgments, many syllogisms have been made.  As a consequence 
there is left an orderly register of results; and often a thought gives 
or seems to give, by direct suggestion, what was originally connected 
with it through many intervening links.  Whether these links are 
momentarily revived in the memory, but so momentarily as to escape the 
detection of conscious analysis, need not here concern us; it is enough 
if we can give an acceptable account of the apparently irrational, or 
non-rational process whereby reason seems to outrun itself, and to 
decide before it has the motives. We may add, in this connexion, the 
theory of Dr. Maudsley, where he explains some of those cases, in which 
what we are convinced are new matters of thought, nevertheless put on 
the air of old recollections.  He supposes the mind to reach a result 
before the conscious attention is directed to the process ; so that, 
when consciousness is fully roused, the object seems familiar. in this 
way the conclusion would appear to anticipate the premisses.  The 
<i>quasi</i>-automatic process. however. is always amenable to the 
judgment of deliberate reflexion, by which it has often to be 
corrected.  A ludicrous instance of inference by rapid association is 
given in Herodotus, in his story of the revolted slaves who after 
repulsing armed attacks, fled when their masters issued out against 
them with that familiar weapon, the whip.  Logical reflexion, if the 
poor wretches had been capable of it would have been useful.  Thus 
logic retains her position as the friend and helper of spontaneous 
reasoning; a position which is accorded to her even by Messrs.  Mill, 
Lewes, and Spencer, who fully admit the use of the syllogism as a 
"verifying process."</P> 

<P>The doctrine above laid down enables us to meet what to the 
unprepared might seem difficulties, of which a specimen or two shall 
now be added. "While we assume," says Mr. Sully,<sup><small><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></small></sup> "that in reasoning 
the mind passes from premisses to conclusion, we must remember that 
this does not answer the actual order of mental events in many, and 
perhaps in the majority of instances.  The conclusion presents itself 
first, and the ground, premiss, or reason, when it distinctly arises in 
the mind at all, recurs rather as an after-thought, and by the 
suggestive force of the similarity between the new case and the old." 
Mr. Spencer<sup><small><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup> has remarks to the same effect.  He says that we go 
straight from a perceived stone to its lines of cleavage, and do not 
travel round by the syllogism, "all crystals have lines of cleavage; 
this stone is a crystal; therefore it has lines of cleavage."</P> 

<P>So far from resenting such objections, we welcome them, as helping 
us to clear up our own conceptions, and as calling our attention to the 
very important fact, that our mental store does not consist of ideas, 
isolated like atoms, or standing in rows like words in a dictionary.  
Rather our ideas make up a sort of organically united whole, one idea 
developing by epigenesis upon another, somewhat after the analogy of 
cells in a plant or animal. The analogy is only an analogy, but it is 
a help for our understanding to conceive, under these figures, 
processes, the precise nature of which will always be for us a mystery.  
Goethe compares the union of our mental conceptions to a subtle weaving 
of many threads together into patterns which gradually display 
themselves:</P> 

<P>The web of thought, we may assume,<br>
Is like some triumph of the loom,<br>
Where one small simple treadle starts<br>
A thousand threads to motion, -- where<br>
A flying shuttle shoots and darts,<br>
Now over here, now under there.<br>
We look, but see not how, so fast<br>
Thread blends with thread, and twines, and mixes<br>
When lo! one single stroke at last<br>
The thousand combinations fixes.<sup><small><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></small></sup> </P>

<P>(c) As too much attention concentrated on the bodily functions may 
derange them, and as even the simple process of jumping a ditch may 
fail from excess of care to do it neatly; so an attempt to think out a 
question in strict philosophic form may deaden or misguide the energies 
of thought. But these facts argue no essential want of convergence 
between the spontaneous and the systematized process; the two may be 
mutually helpful, and each has besides its own peculiar place.  Let 
them combine where they usefully can, and keep apart where combination 
is detrimental.  This is the substantial settlement of the matter; and 
it meets any such case as that of Sir Walter Scott, who found it 
sometimes an aid to his progress in a novel, if he began to read a book 
on some other subject.  The desired train of thought, as if jealous of 
a rival, came in to dispossess the ideas given by the book; just as in 
a parallel case churchgoers involuntarily recall, within the sacred 
walls, the fact which they tried in vain to recover outside.</P> 

<P>3. To put in the limits within which a doctrine is meant to be 
accepted, often saves a world of misconstruction; and the present 
instance is one calling for a statement of limitations.</P> 

<P>First, no account is taken of grace and of supernatural revelation, 
though both are facts.  What we call revelation is of rarer occurrence, 
and vouchsafed only to the favoured few: but unless the Church is to 
give in to Pelagius, and to those who go further than ever Pelagius 
went in the direction of naturalism, she must maintain that Christians 
are in constant receipt of illuminations by grace from above, both as 
to their faith and as to their guidance in conduct.</P> 

<P>Besides the supernatural mysticism treated of by the Pseudo-
Dionysius, his commentator Maximus, St. Bernard, Hugo and Richard of 
St. Victor, St. Bonaventure, Gerson, and pious writers who have not 
been professed theologians, there is asserted also a sort of natural 
mysticism.  This we must make over to the Society for Psychical 
Research, for it cannot be reduced, by our present knowledge, to 
logical system: whereas the truths that can be so reduced suffice for 
a Philosophy of Certitude.</P> 

<P><CENTER>ADDENDA.</CENTER>
</P>

<P>(I) The Tractarian movement, at Oxford, offers some instructive 
contrasts between the mind which holds that thought can be rigorously 
carried on, and the mind that distrusts philosophy.  In the notice of 
the death of the late Dr. Ward, a leader in <EM>The Times</EM> remarked 
pointedly upon the circumstance, that in his university days he was a 
noted stickler for logic; "whereas," adds the writer, "most people 
are content to say as much as meets the occasion, in the blandest form 
and in the pleasantest tone.  Logic is not much required for the dinner 
table or on the platform."</P> 

<P>Before bringing forward the contrast between Dr. Ward and other men 
at Oxford, it is worth while inserting an illustration precisely of 
this "bland form and pleasant tone" of the illogician. "One peculiar 
defect of mine," confesses or boasts M. Renan,<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> "has more than once 
been injurious to my prospects in life.  This is my indecision of 
character, which often leads me into positions, from which I have a 
great difficulty in extricating myself.  This defect is further 
complicated by a good quality, which often leads me into as many 
difficulties as the most serious of my defects.  I have never been able 
to do anything which would give pain to any one. . . . In talking and 
in letter-writing I am at times singularly weak.  With the exception of 
a select few, between whom and myself there is a bond of intellectual 
brotherhood, I say to people just what I think is likely to please 
them.  With an inveterate habit of being over polite, I am anxious to 
detect what the person I am talking with would like me to say.  My 
attention, when I am conversing with any one, is engrossed in trying to 
guess his ideas, and from excess of deference to anticipate him in the 
expression of them.  My correspondence will be a disgrace to me, if it 
is published after my death." From this charge of extreme complaisance 
he excepts his published works; but they too must be affected by 
certain qualities which shall be added for the completion of the 
picture. "By mere force of things and despite my conscientious efforts 
to the contrary, I am a member of the romantic school, protesting 
against romanticism; a Utopian inculcating the doctrine of half-
measures; an idealist unsuccessfully endeavouring to pass muster for a 
realist, a tissue of contradictions resembling the double-natured 
hircocerf of scholasticism. One of my two halves must have been busy 
demolishing the other half, and it was well said by that keen observer, 
M. Challemel-Lacour, he feels like a woman and acts like a child.  I 
have no reason to complain of such being the case, as this actual 
constitution has procured for me one of the keenest intellectual joys a 
man can taste." That will do for M. Renan; now for Dr. Ward's more 
immediate contrast.</P> 

<P>Again the risk of doing an injustice is avoided by our being able to 
quote an autobiographical sketch, of which the responsibility lies with 
the subject.  Speaking of his part in the Oxford movement Mr. T. Mozley 
says:<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup> "Why did I go so far in the movement, and why did I go no 
further? Why enter upon arguments, and not accept their conclusions? 
Why advance to stand still, and in doing so commit myself to a final 
retreat? The reasons of this lame and impotent conclusion lay within 
myself, wide apart from the great controversy in which I was but an 
intruder.  I was never really serious, in a sober, business-like way.  
<EM>I had neither the power nor the will to enter into any great 
argument, with the resolution to accept the legitimate conclusion.</EM> 
Even when I was sacrificing my days, my strength, my means, my 
prospects, my peace and quiet, all I had, to the cause, it was an 
earthly contest not a spiritual one.  It occupied me, it excited me, it 
gratified my vanity, it soothed my self-complacency, it identified me 
in what I honestly believed to be a very grand crusade, it offered me 
the hope of contributing to very grand achievements. But good as the 
cause might be, and considerable as my part might be in it, I was never 
the better man for it."</P> 

<P>If it may be permitted to allude to yet a third autobiography, we 
will mention the <EM>Memoirs of Mark Pattison,</EM> who tells how, 
having engaged in the Tractarian movement, he ended by diverting his 
thoughts from it to scientific ideas, and his Tractarianism succumbed, 
not to argument, but to "inanition" -- died of starvation.</P> 

<P>In the order of God's providence these things are "written for our 
instruction," that so far as we have the opportunity and the need, we 
may train our minds to follow a more rigorous method of thinking.  It 
is suggestive in the course of reading, to notice who are the authors 
who express their contempt for philosophic system, and who claim a free 
range for thinking as they fancy.  A significant list could be drawn 
up, in which the much-belauded Goethe would stand as a warning example; 
though not all would recognise that his want of hold upon systematic 
truth was a calamity (Goethe, <EM>Sein Leben und Seine Werke,</EM> von 
Alexander Baumgartner, S.J., Vol. I. pp. 27, 28).</P> 

<P>(2) In behalf of the view that human thought is essentially loose 
and inaccurate, it may be argued that philosophy has shown the same 
characters in the formation of grammatical forms.  Far from having a 
strict propriety in them, many are traced back to bad analogies, to 
pieces of clumsiness, and to downright blunders; so that a man who has 
had a little insight into the origin of some usages, is not much 
inclined, at this late hour, to do vigorous battle in the cause of a 
fancied purism against established usage.  If it he asked, Why may not 
thought have its inner anomalies of a like character? the reply is 
ready at once, Because thought is not language.  The latter is made up 
of conventional signs, which may very well have had an illogical 
origin; whereas thought is no conventional sign, but the most natural 
of all natural signs.  Thought, if anomalous, is simply undone.</P> 

<P>(3) What is called "unconscious thought," by the aid of which many 
of the mind's gathered materials are supposed to be automatically 
arranged, will be considered in the chapter on consciousness.  It may 
very be that certain cerebral changes go on unconsciously, which yet 
are most useful or needful for the clearing up and arranging of 
thoughts; but whatever these processes, the final outcome will have to 
be judged on conscious principles before it can reasonably be 
pronounced true or false.</P> 

<P>(4) In reference to what has been said about the reasonable 
defensibility of all vital truths, we may profitably quote a decree of 
the Congregation of the Index, of June 11, 1855: "Reason can establish 
with certainty the existence of God, the spiritual nature of the soul, 
and the freedom of man's will."<sup><small><a href="#n_c">{c}</a></small></sup></P>
