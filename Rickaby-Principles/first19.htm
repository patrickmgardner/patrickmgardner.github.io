<P><EM>Addenda.</EM></P><hr>

<P> 1. AT the outset many differences of definition, accompanied by 
some real divergences of doctrine, perplex the inquiry into 
consciousness.  We will begin with the matter of definition, not so 
much seeking to exhaust the list of actually proposed definitions, as 
to show a possible scale of increasing contents in the meaning 
assignable to the term defined. First, consciousness may be made to 
signify no object beyond the simple fact that we are aware of our own 
thoughts and feelings as they occur.  Next, we may include in 
consciousness, besides the states just mentioned, the substantial 
subject of which they are the modifications, and which upon reflexion 
is manifested, not indeed in itself alone, but in these very affections 
or activities of its own.  Thus consciousness would embrace the 
substantial self and its immediately perceptible states while these 
latter lasted.  A trust in memory and expectation carries consciousness 
still further beyond present states of self to past and future.  
Fourthly, we may widen consciousness to the compass of all known 
objects, whether self or not-self, provided such objects be present at 
the time to the faculties;<sup><small><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></small></sup> so that, in the language of Hamilton, we 
should be <EM>conscious</EM> of last week's concert only as an image 
retained in the memory, but for the reality of the past fact we should 
have to depend on <EM>belief.</EM>  Lastly, we may abolish this 
distinction between present and non-present, and declare that 
whatsoever object we know, of that we are conscious.<sup><small><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup> Distinguishing 
between consciousness and self-consciousness, some prefer to say, that 
while we are merely <EM>conscious</EM> of any outer object which we 
happen to know, we are <EM>self-conscious</EM> of a headache, a mental 
anxiety, or any other internal state of our own.  So far for matters of 
choice in the definition of a term.</P> 

<P>2. We must now approach real disputes, and begin with that about the 
existence of unconscious intelligence.  Some would make the test of the 
presence of reason in any substance its power of adjusting itself to 
ends; in such sort that a growing plant, and a developing animal germ 
would be said to reason out their evolution.  Kant, while he will not 
say that organic processes are intelligent, would have us look upon 
them in that light as an aid to our understanding, when we consider the 
operations of living matter; and the same artifice he would extend to 
the working of merely physical law.  Many others also show the like 
tendency to attribute some dark kind of intelligence to the self-
arranging powers of matter in chemical reaction; and this tendency is 
specially natural in those who regard the elements of matter as 
primitive "mind-stuff," only needing a certain degree of organization 
to cause it to wake up into consciousness.  Long ago Telesius and 
Campanella -- and they were not the first -- supposed an obscure 
knowledge to reside in minerals and plants.  Each of the monads of 
Leibnitz was supposed to reflect within itself all the universe; the 
difference being, that some monads were as in a deep sleep, others as 
in a dream, others as in full wakefulness.  Many evolutionists, 
however, attribute no cognitive power to natural objects till something 
higher than the lowest ranges of the animal kingdom is reached; and 
even here they would regard the mere organic processes as not cognitive.  
We are thus brought across a question which is far more than a matter 
of the definition of terms; the conflict is between two most opposite 
doctrines as to the source of intellect and consciousness -- whether 
consciousness springs directly from unconscious intelligence, and 
remotely from the non-intelligent.</P> 

<P>The dispute however which specially concerns us turns on the point, 
whether there can be sensation, thought, and volition without 
consciousness.  Those who answer in the affirmative, occasionally make 
of consciousness a distinct faculty; but now-a-days they would more 
generally be content with maintaining that consciousness depends on the 
relative degree, or intensity, of the act of which we are said to be 
conscious.  It will be instructive to listen to a few testimonies on 
both sides; on the part of those who affirm, or seem to affirm, and on 
the part of those who deny, or seem to deny, that consciousness is 
bound up with every sensation, thought, and volition.</P> 

<P>(a) Hutcheson,<sup><small><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></small></sup> who is accused by Harpilton of making 
consciousness a distinct faculty, at least teaches that all sensations 
and thoughts are conscious; and Reid,<sup><small><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></small></sup> who does indeed make 
consciousness a distinct faculty, or "different power," when he is 
describing it, gives no hint that he admits such a thing as unconscious 
thought, and in the second of the given references he says expressly, 
"consciousness always goes along with perception."<sup><small><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></small></sup> In Leibnitz, 
however, we have an author who, besides speaking of unconscious ideas 
in minerals and plants, held that in man there were unconscious 
perceptions, or, as he expresses it, perceptions without apperceptions.  
Ferrier is very insistent, and rather mystic, in the way in which he 
distinguishes consciousness from sensation and reason.  So far as a 
single passage can be illustrative, perhaps, the following is one of 
the best; but it must be remembered that the sense attributed to the 
word consciousness is peculiar:<sup><small><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></small></sup> "What do we mean precisely by the 
word consciousness, and upon what ground do we refuse to attribute 
consciousness to the animal creation? In the first place, by 
consciousness we mean the notion of self; that notion of self, and that 
self-reference, which in man generally, though by no means invariably, 
accompanies his sensations, passions, emotions, play of reason, or 
states of mind whatsoever. . . . The presence of reason by no means 
necessarily implies a cognisance of reason in the creatures manifesting 
it. Man might easily have been endowed with reason, without at the same 
time becoming aware of his endowment, or blending with it the notion of 
himself." The context shows that reason is not here employed in its 
ordinary sense; we had better pass on to the plainer terms of Mr. Bain, 
who says:<sup><small><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></small></sup> "Consciousness is inseparable from feeling (i.e., 
Sensation and Emotion), but not, as it appears to me, from action and 
thought.  True, our actions and thoughts are usually conscious, that 
is, known to us by an inward perception; but the consciousness of an 
act is manifestly not the act, and, though the assertion is less 
obvious, I believe that consciousness of a thought is distinct from the 
thought.  The three terms, Feeling, Emotion, and Consciousness, will, I 
think, be found in reality to express one and the same attribute of 
mind . . . which is the foremost and most unmistakeable attribute of 
mind." Thus knowledge and feeling are distinguished, and the latter, 
not the former, is made the essential fundamental act of mind; on which 
theory we may conceive a mind blindly feeling without knowledge of an 
object, yet conscious of the feeling.  Lewes holds that, "we often 
think as unconsciously as we breathe." His theory of consciousness is 
thus stated:<sup><small><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></small></sup> "Consciousness and unconsciousness are correlatives, 
both belonging to the sphere of sentience. Every one of the unconscious 
processes is operant, changes the general state of the organism, and is 
capable of at once issuing in a <EM>discriminated sensation,</EM> when 
the forces which balance it are disturbed. I was unconscious of the 
scratch of my pen in writing the last sentence, but I am distinctly 
conscious of every scratch in writing this one.  Then as now, the 
scratching sound sent a faint thrill through my organism, but its 
<EM>relative intensity</EM> was too faint for discrimination; now that 
I have redistributed the co-operant forces, by what is called an act of 
attention, I hear distinctly every sound the pen produces. The 
consciousness -- by Descartes erected into an essential condition of 
thought -- was by Leibnitz reduced to an accompaniment, which not only 
may be absent, but in the majority of cases is absent.  The teaching of 
most modern psychologists is, that consciousness forms but a small item 
in the total of Psychical processes; "a doctrine illustrated by George 
Eliot in the important part which that author makes unconscious 
influences exert in the play and the formation of character.  Turning 
to Dr. Maudsley,<sup><small><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></small></sup> we find the following confirmatory sentences: "It 
is a truth which cannot be too distinctly remembered, that 
consciousness is not coextensive with mind, but is an incidental 
accompaniment of mind." And again, "It seems to me that man might be as 
good a reasoning machine without as with consciousness.  It is only 
with a certain intensity of representation, or of conception, that 
consciousness appears." Such opinions are largely prompted by 
pathological cases, in which the patients go through their routine 
actions as if they were unconsciously rational.  A French soldier, 
wounded in the Franco-German War, has furnished a very striking 
example.  Mr. Huxley allows that possibly he is conscious, in spite of 
appearances to the contrary.  In a different category, yet bearing on 
the same opinions, and illustrating the old law that objective 
perception, and subjective advertence to self, are in inverse 
proportion, stand some words of Cardinal Newman, which shall close the 
quotations on this side of the controversy.<sup><small><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></small></sup> "In what may be called 
the mechanical operations of our minds, propositions pass before us and 
receive our assent without our consciousness. Indeed I may fairly say, 
that those assents, which we give with a direct knowledge of what we 
are doing, are few compared with the multitude of like acts which pass 
through our minds in long succession, without our observing them.  That 
mode of assent, which includes this unconscious exercise, I may call 
<EM>simple assent;</EM> but such assents as must be made consciously 
and deliberately, I call <EM>complex or reflex assents."</EM> 
Scientific certitude is thus "the perception of a truth with the 
perception that it is true, or the consciousness of knowing as 
expressed in the phrase, I know that I know."</P> 

<P>(b) If we omit the discussion of mere sensitive action, and confine 
ourselves to the main point, intellectual action strictly so 
called, it is certainly the doctrine of St.Thomas, that all thought 
must be consciously referred to self, though the advertence need not be 
very explicit.  That such is his teaching may be gathered from what has 
already been explained in Part I. chapter ii. concerning his doctrine 
about judgment, namely, that when the mind judges, it implicitly 
affirms the consciousness of its own knowledge.  And a more general 
assertion of the inseparability between thought and consciousness may 
be found in the <EM>Summa</EM>.<sup><small><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></small></sup> At the same time it is well to 
remember, that the disputes about consciousness as a special element, 
or aspect, in mental life, belongs rather to recent times.</P> 

<P>It may be well to cite here one or two English writers on philosophy 
who proclaim that consciousness must ever go with thought.  Locke<sup><small><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></small></sup> 
in the course of his well known contention, that we could not have 
innate ideas without being aware ot them, writes: "It is altogether as 
intelligible to say that a body is extended without parts, as that 
anything thinks without being conscious of it, or perceiving that it 
does so." Dr. Brown<sup><small><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></small></sup> may be quoted for the same opinion, though his 
main effort is bent on the proof of what is not quite the same thing, 
namely, that consciousness is not a distinct act or faculty. If 
Hamilton is put in the same class, it must be with the reservation that 
what he says about latent thought, and about the difference between 
knowledge and the blind element, belief, considerably takes off from 
his value as a witness.  For example, he teaches that "to know is to 
know that we know," and in note H, already referred to, he lays it 
down, that "while knowledge, feeling, and desire, in all their various 
modifications, can only exist as the knowledge, feeling, and desire of 
some determined subject, and as this subject can only know, feel, and 
desire inasmuch as it is conscious that it knows, feels, and desires, 
it is therefore manifest that all the actions and passions of the 
intellectual self involve consciousness as their generic and essential 
quality." On the other hand,<sup><small><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></small></sup> he declares his firm conviction that 
there are unconscious "mental activities and passivities;" but then 
he seems careful not to call these "thoughts" or "cognitions," but 
only "modifications" of the mind; which modifications if they were 
referred only to material processes in the brain, helpful to thought, 
and were literally "unconscious cerebrations," could be allowed 
without demur. A more uncompromising witness than Hamilton is found in 
Dr. M'Cosh: "I believe that we are momentarily conscious of every 
sensation, idea, thought, or emotion of the mind." Any appearances to 
the contrary he attributes to faintness of advertence and lapse of 
memory.</P> 

<P> In using authors of the school of pure empiricism, we must remember 
the deductions to be made for men who cast doubt on the substantial 
self, and assert only series of states unaccountably linked together in 
consciousness.  Under these drawbacks the two Mills<sup><small><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></small></sup> may be quoted; 
the father as saying, "To feel a sensation is the sensation, to be 
conscious of an idea is that idea;" and the son as praising his 
father's words.  From the same school we have also Mr. Huxley teaching 
that "there is only a verbal distinction between having a sensation, 
and knowing that one has it."</P> 

<P>If now we may leave our insular for continental writers, we have an 
example in Spinoza,<sup><small><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></small></sup> who says: "As soon as any one knows a thing, by 
that very fact he knows that he knows, and knows simultaneously that he 
is conscious that he knows what he knows, and so on <EM>ad 
infinitum."</EM> Kant<sup><small><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></small></sup> declares that no object can be perceived or 
conceived, unless through the unity of consciousness; and adds: "It is 
the <EM>one consciousness</EM> which unites the manifold which has been 
perceived successively. This consciousness may often be very faint, and 
we may connect it in the effect only, and not in the act itself, with 
the production of a concept.  But in spite of this that consciousness, 
though deficient in pointed clearness, must always be there, and 
without it concepts, and therefore knowledge of objects, are perfectly 
impossible." Cousin, in the lectures already quoted, though in one 
place he professes to leave the question open, yet speaks as if his 
impression were, that all thought must be conscious: "It is the 
fundamental attribute of thought to have consciousness of itself.  
Consciousness is the inner light which illumines everything in the soul 
-- the accompaniment and the echo of all our faculties.  And in his 
<EM>Introduction &agrave; L'Histoire de la Philosophie,"</EM><sup><small><a href="#n_18">{18}</a></small></sup> he teaches 
that "intelligence without consciousness is the mere abstract 
possibility of intelligence, not actual intelligence."</P> 

<P>3. Enough has now been adduced to put the reader in a position for 
seeing how the dispute lies in the controversy about the nature of 
consciousness as distinguished from other terms.  Probably the 
divergence between some of the writers, who have been ranged on the 
opposite sides, is not as great as might at first sight appear.  But it 
is time to be laying down our statement of the true doctrine: for we 
must so far explain and defend consciousness as to warrant, in general, 
its use for the acquisition of certitude.</P> 

<P>(a) consciousness signifies the reference of some mental state to 
self: and what precisely we mean by self has first to be settled.  A 
thorough-going idealist,<sup><small><a href="#n_19">{19}</a></small></sup> who confines himself to ideas as successive 
phenomena, ought to call self the subjective aspect of these ideas, and 
not-self the objective aspect; considered as so many acts of thinking, 
the ideas form the self, while these same ideas viewed on their 
reverse,or objective, sides, would constitute the not-self. In the 
phrase, "My thoughts about things," "my thoughts" would be self, "about 
things " would be not-self.  At least this is the only consistent 
course for idealism pure and simple, which is at the same time 
phenomenalism pure and simple.  There is here no substantial soul and 
no substantial body included under self.  A system a degree better 
would admit, within the self, a substantial principle, either a spirit 
only, or a compound of matter and spirit. Lastly, the true meaning of 
self, which is vindicated partly in various passages of this 
treatise,<sup><small><a href="#n_20">{20}</a></small></sup> and partly in the treatises on General Metaphysics and on 
Psychology, is the composite substantial man, immediately aware of a 
number of bodily and mental phenomena as belonging to himself, and 
aware of his continuous personal identity.  Though it clearly requires 
reflexion to bring out the element by analysis, man is immediately 
conscious of his own substantial <i>Ego</i>, not in its unmodified 
condition, but under its perceptible modifications: and what is called 
the "logical unity of consciousness" gives, notwithstanding Kant's 
denial, the fullest warrant for assuming "the substantial unity" of 
the thinking subject.</P> 

<P>(b) If, therefore, we regard the self as a compound of body and 
soul, in examining into the nature of human consciousness we must next 
make a distinction between sense and intellect.  The sensitive faculty 
in the more perfectly organized animals, possesses, as we judge from 
the arrangement of the nervous system and from results in actual life, 
a certain consentience, which, in the less strict sense, may be called 
consciousness.  St. Thomas teaches that the sensitive apparatus is, 
after its manner, sensible of its own sensations; though what is the 
relation between outer organs and cerebral centres, in bringing about 
this effect, need not here be discussed.  While the horse or the dog 
are incapable of the full recognition of a self as such, they have, in 
the inferior order, a practical appreciation of self, which ministers 
to their pleasures and pains, and to self-preservation.  But it would 
be going far beyond data to argue a more perfect knowledge of self from 
the signs which animals exhibit of vanity or jealousy, analogous to 
these passions in man.  As an animal, man also has his consentience, or 
sensitive consciousness.  What, however, specially interests us is 
man's <EM>intellectual</EM> consciousness, which some scholastics 
subdivide into <i>direct</i> and <EM>reflex.</EM>  In a broad sense all 
consciousness, so far as it, includes some knowledge of the subject-
knowing, some return of self upon self, must be <EM>reflex</EM>: still 
the difference here intended will appear in a simple example.  While we 
explicitly perceive the truth of a geometric principle, we implicitly, 
in the same act, <EM>in actu exercito,</EM> are made aware of our own 
knowledge.  This is styled <i>direct</i> consciousness.  Afterwards, by 
a new act, of set purpose, <EM>in actu signato,</EM> we may 
return upon our late perception, and make this, the mental fact, the 
object of our explicit knowledge.  This is styled <EM>reflex</EM> 
consciousness, as being expressly reflex.  In the one case, while we 
know an object we are subordinately conscious of our knowledge; in the 
other case, we make this consciousness the principal matter of our 
reflexion, and degrade the object to a subordinate place.</P> 

<P>It will render a man all the more cautious in denying the 
possibility of the direct consciousness, if he considers how, in its 
absence, it becomes apparently impossible to have the reflex 
consciousness.  A thought not in consciousness is, in itself, a 
sufficiently difficult notion to entertain; but supposing such a thing 
to have had place in us, how are we ever to recover it by means of what 
we have called reflex consciousness? How is memory to catch up an act 
which is bygone, and which, while it lasted, never was in immediate 
consciousness? Sometimes, indeed, by simple inference we may gather 
that a certain idea must have passed through the mind, though we have 
no recollection of the fact.  But the more we think of it, the less 
will inference be deemed capable of supplying the want of all direct 
consciousness. With Father Palmieri,<sup><small><a href="#n_21">{21}</a></small></sup> who understands by <EM>sensus 
intimus</EM> what we have called <EM>conscientia directa,</EM> we may 
argue thus: "The act of the innermost sense (<i>i.e.</i>, of direct 
consciousness) is not in reality distinct from the act it reports, or 
at most the distinction, if any, is a mental distinction; in other 
words, when the living agent feels (is conscious of) his act, his 
experience of it is in reality nothing else but the self-same act 
objectively present to the thinking, feeling, or appetitive agent.  For 
if another act were needed, this in its turn would have to be reported 
by direct consciousness, which is then supposed to be distinct from the 
first act.  This second act, for the same reason, would have to be 
taken as a distinct act from a third, and thus we should require an 
endless series."<sup><small><a href="#n_22">{22}</a></small></sup> In other words, if our acts of knowledge did not 
at once link themselves on to a conscious self, they never could become 
so attached at all.</P> 

<P>It is with the fullest advertence to the difficulty we have in 
"numbering off" acts of mind that the last pages have been penned.  It 
is only very roughly that we designate a process to be one act in 
material operations, and when we get beyond these, and ask ourselves 
how many acts the mind can or does perform at once; whether there is 
succession between acts or contemporaneity; whether a given result 
requires one act or more; undoubtedly we are on ground which is to us 
generally very obscure.  It is the teaching of St. Thomas,<sup><small><a href="#n_23">{23}</a></small></sup> that the 
mind can exist in only one state at a time, and that an apparent 
multiplicity of simultaneous acts must really be reducible to a unity. 
There is always a great difficulty in discussing such subjects in 
detail, because we can form no picture to ourselves of the mode of 
operation proper to a spiritual substance, which has not separate 
parts, but which works with a marvellous unity and simplicity.  To 
overlook these truths would lay us open to the danger of multiplying, 
or refusing to multiply, acts, in a way which reason could not 
afterwards justify.  An analysis into mentally distinct parts does not 
prove physical parts.  Hence in the little that has been said about 
direct and reflex consciousness, care has been taken to speak within 
the bounds of legitimate analysis.  Of the direct consciousness, which 
is the most difficult to speak about safely, rather than say that one 
act is conscious of outer object and of inner self, we say that one 
act, whatever its simplicity or complexity, suffices to constitute the 
mind conscious of outer object and of its own knowledge of that object.  
Thus we make the subject of the predication rather the mind acting, 
than simply the act.  At least this is a safer form of wording.</P> 

<P>With a still further view to being safe in the form of wording, we 
may note the special difficulty which, when we are dealing with an act 
of volition, lies against saying, that in direct consciousness the act 
of volition becomes part of its own known object.  For we do not 
attribute knowledge to the volition as such: rather we speak of will as 
enlightened by intellect, and of intellect as cognisant of volitions. 
Hence with regard to our immediate consciousness of the acts of our 
will, we are led to devise this mode of expression, that, without 
further determination, the mere presence of the volition in the soul 
suffices to enable the intellect to be simultaneously conscious of its 
presence, while some intelligence of an object is the pre-requisite of 
any volition at all.  How, moreover, the distinction between intellect 
and will can in any sense be called real, is discussed in psychology: 
at least the soul as knowing may be distinguished from the soul as 
willing.  Another cautionary remark is that while we have not been 
talking in comfortable oblivion of the difficulty which besets the 
numbering and the distinction of mental acts and faculties, so neither 
have we been oblivious of the very strong objection which some 
philosophers have to the idea of thought or self becoming an object to 
itself.  Mr. Sully is but following Comte, Dr. Maudsley, Mr. 
Spencer,<sup><small><a href="#n_24">{24}</a></small></sup> and several others, when he affirms that all introspection 
must be retrospection: that man can reflect, not on the mental state 
which is, but only on that which <EM>was.</EM> In reply we must be 
allowed to plead, that this is reducible in the end to an <EM>a 
priori</EM> dogma, or at best to a false analogy taken from material 
action, and is refuted by facts.  Do what we will, we cannot be true to 
fact and deny a real reduplication, as it were, of thought upon thought 
and of self upon self. There is in us a power of genuine reflexion.  
The mind has a re-entering, self-penetrating, self-permeating activity 
which makes it more intimately at home with itself than anything which 
a materialistic philosophy can allow; and, say we, all the worse for 
materialism, not for facts.  So far, however, as the denial that 
thought can become object to itself, rests on an author's definition of 
"object" or "self," we can only beg him to improve his definitions, and 
allow for that marvellous gift of self-consciousness, which we all 
undoubtedly possess, but which recent definitions seem expressly 
devised to exclude.</P> 

<P>(c) Now that we have first called attention to the fact of sensitive 
consciousness and next considered intellectual consciousness in its two 
branches, direct and reflex, we must give a moment's attention to the 
relation between sense and intellect in respect to consciousness.  A 
man's feeling of hunger, for example, does not stop short at its animal 
level, but the subject becomes intellectually conscious that his 
stomach is craving for food.  Thus we are reminded that one object of 
our intellectual perception is our own bodily state: and because, by 
our definition, the body and its affections are part of the composite 
self, such perceptions must be ranked under the category of 
self-consciousness.  Hereupon a question suggests itself.  We have been 
unable simply to accept the fact of an unconscious sensation or of an 
unconscious thought; but may not there be some sensations, present 
indeed to the sensitive consciousness, but never manifested to the 
intellectual consciousness: so that we can never intelligently 
affirm their presence? To answer, Yes, might to some sound an 
unproveable assertion, but at any rate it would, as a proposition, not 
contain that intrinsic conflict of terms which we seem to see in the 
affirmation, that some thoughts are unconscious.  In any case, there 
are many facts of sensation which become objects of intellectual 
consciousness, and this relation between the two departments of 
consciousness is the point to which we have been directing 
attention.</P> 

<P>(d) We are now in a condition to propose our own classification of 
the objects of consciousness, and to defend the validity of 
consciousness in their regard.  To begin with the affections of the 
composite self, we have bodily affections, cognitive and appetitive, as 
sensibly perceived; we have the same again as intellectually perceived; 
and thirdly we have the spiritual affections, cognitive and appetitive, 
of course intellectually or spiritually perceived.  All these objects 
are connected with our own person. Next, so far as whatever outer 
objects we know, or have any volition about, are known at least in some 
reference to our conscious self, this element of self, again making its 
appearance, justifies a use of the word consciousness, whether we 
distinguish it from what is more rigorously self-consciousness or not.  
Thus the term consciousness, as Hamilton<sup><small><a href="#n_25">{25}</a></small></sup> in one place declares, is 
ultimately extended to our whole sensitive and intellectual life, so 
far as we are rendered aware of our condition, whatever the object of 
cognition or appetency. Against the above classification a difficulty 
of minor importance might be raised.  Mr. Bain dislikes calling all our 
emotive states by the name of volitions, because he surmises that there 
are some neutral feelings, in regard to which we have no appetencies 
either for or against them.  But really to make provision for such 
vague and disputable states, it is not worth while disturbing the old 
division into cognitive and appetitive powers, whether of sense or of 
intellect.  Accordingly no scruple has been made about going on the 
lines of the old tradition.</P> 

<P>A short exposition of facts will now establish the principal thesis 
of this chapter, that consciousness cannot but be valid in what it 
testifies about self, as also in what it really testifies about 
non-self, so far as it may be applied indirectly to this latter region.  
It is a position the very sceptics have been unable to impugn, that 
facts of consciousness, as such, cannot be gainsaid.  Whatsoever a man 
is conscious of, of that he is conscious; and this principle must be 
extended to the feeling of certainty about any objective truth, no 
matter what, which is presented to the mind with objective evidence.  
As Mr. Conder argues: "Since the presentments of consciousness are not 
judgments but primary facts, they cannot be unreal: only our 
interpretation of consciousness may be erroneous." "On this," adds a 
critic in <EM>Mind,</EM> we are all agreed." The matter may be 
brought under a larger doctrine propounded in Part I., chapter ii., 
that no mere apprehension can be other than true, however erroneous may 
be the judgment of which it is made the occasion.  As a case in point, 
what a man with an amputated leg feels, he really must feel; but he 
judges amiss when he declares the feeling to be in a member which he no 
longer possesses.  The like may be said of a fever patient who 
complains of being cold; of the Arctic explorer who, touching a piece 
of long-exposed iron, pronounces it hot; of the man who says that he 
has the experience as of two selves contending within him -- a 
pathological state, which, it is surmised, may be due to some want of 
co-ordination between the two hemispheres of the brain.  So far, 
however, as any insanity creeps in, the subject is no longer fit to 
serve as a specimen of normal humanity.</P> 

<P>Still it may be urged, if the interpretation of conscious facts may 
be wrong, how are we advanced beyond idealism by the assurance, that at 
least we may rest secure as to the facts themselves? We do not allow 
that interpretation is so liable, at all times, to error, that never 
can it be safely trusted.  It is guaranteed by the conditions already 
stated in the chapters on the Criterion of Truth, on Error, on the 
Veracity of the Senses, on the Validity of Ideas.  All that the present 
chapter adds to what has gone before, is a clearing up of notions upon 
what is meant by consciousness, and an emphasizing of that truth, so 
neatly stated by Cousin: "It is an inherent attribute of reason to 
believe in itself."<sup><small><a href="#n_26">{26}</a></small></sup> The root of agnosticism is an unreasonable 
distrust of reason in itself, as the root of sound philosophy is a 
legitimate self-confidence on the part of the mind in reliance, upon 
its conscious powers.<sup><small><a href="#n_27">{27}</a></small></sup> As will appear in Psychology, it is rather to 
the right reading of consciousness that we must appeal, than to a 
theory about the dynamics of motives, when such grave questions have to 
be settled as that of the freedom of the will; and the same holds true 
of many other philosophical questions, notably about consciousness.</P> 

<P>Not at all, therefore, can a special chapter on Consciousness be 
deemed superfluous.</P> 

<P>ADDENDA.</P>

<P>(1) Kantians have got such a decided position in this country, that 
their leader's theory on consciousness ought not to be quite passed 
over in silence: though we must beg leave to reject it on the ground 
that it is against the immediate light of evidence, resting as it does 
on a denial of the facts that some of our clearest conceptions of 
things are more than forms of the mind, and stand for objects which the 
mind can contemplate as such.  Kant then distinguishes the 
<EM>empirical consciousness</EM> which takes note of the changeable 
conditions of the subject, from the <EM>pure consciousness</EM> which 
is <EM>a priori</EM> and unchangeable: but he utterly denies that we 
can be conscious of a substantial Ego or personality. "It is clear," 
says Kuno Fischer, "that the thinking subject can never be an object 
of possible knowledge, because it is merely the formal condition of 
possible knowledge; and it cannot be an object of intuition, because it 
forms in itself no phenomenon, but only the highest formal condition of 
phenomena.  All the conditions are wanting for us to judge that the 
subject of thinking is a thinking substance, or that the soul is a 
substance." Again: "The <EM>Ego</EM> is no object, but only appears 
to be one: it is the formal logical condition of all objects.  On this 
illusion rests the whole of rational psychology: I <EM>think</EM> does 
not mean <EM>a substance. thinks.</EM>  That I am conscious in all my 
various states of my unity does not mean that a substance is conscious 
of its unity -- that there is a personal substance.  From the mere Ego, 
torture it as you will, you can never prove an existential judgment.  
From the mere unity of self-consciousness there follows no cognition of 
any object.  That in all my states I am conscious of my subjective 
unity is a mere analytical judgment, which brings us no further than I 
<EM>think</EM>."<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>(2) The curious may find some interest in seeing how theorizers of 
the calibre of Hartmann work out the notion of unconscious thought.  It 
is impossible to say exactly what that author means; but he has some 
such fancy as that the Great Unconscious evolved the universe for a 
long time intelligently, but without consciousness.  When at last a 
sudden shock produced consciousness, this was found to be a source 
mainly of pain.  Hence the desirability of bringing about the abolition 
of consciousness.</P> 

<P>(3) The subject of latent thought is one into which we cannot probe 
very deep.  What is styled our <EM>habitual,</EM> as distinguished from 
our <EM>actual</EM> thought, is certainly something permanently 
existing, even while we are not using it.  The historian with the 
materials of half a Record Office stored up in his memory, whilst he is 
wholly engrossed with the one thought of his own money affairs, 
indisputably keeps his knowledge in a latent condition; though how to 
describe this condition is to us a great puzzle. If "unconscious 
thought" is a phrase used to express this undoubted fact, then it has a 
true significance.  But more often it signifies operations going on, 
with rational results, among the hidden material, or even additions 
made to it by fresh observations, and then the question becomes more 
intricate, and many are inclined to suppose some degree of 
consciousness to enter in, scarce noticeable at the time, and 
straightway forgotten -- evanescent as a dream, the memory of which is 
occasionally preserved by the merest accident, but generally quite 
lost.</P> 

<P>(4) The assertion of our consciousness about our own ideas, if 
clumsily made, is just what gives the appearance of the error we have 
so strongly repudiated, namely, that knowledge is of ideas, and that to 
get from ideas to things requires a bridge which no philosopher can 
build.</P> 

<P>(5) As bearing out the statements in the text about the complexity 
of human action and the difficulty of numbering acts, a report of an 
address by Sir James Paget, delivered at the Mansion House, March 4, 
1888, is worth preserving. "He remembered once hearing Mdlle. Janotha 
play a presto by Mendelssohn, and he counted the notes, and the time 
occupied.  She played 5,595 notes in four minutes, three seconds.  It 
seemed startling, but let them look at it in the fair amount of its 
wonder. Every one of those notes involved certain movements of a 
finger -- at least two: and many of them involved an additional movement 
laterally as well as those up and down.  They also involved movements 
of the wrists, elbows, and arms, altogether probably not less than one 
movement for each note.  Therefore there were three distinct movements 
for each note.  As there were twenty-four notes each second, the total 
was seventy-two movements per second.  Moreover, each of these notes 
was determined by the will to a chosen place, with a certain force, at 
a certain time, and with a certain duration.  Therefore there were four 
distinct qualities in each of the seventy-two movements in each second.  
Such were the transmissions outwards.  And all these were conditional 
on consciousness of the position of each hand and each finger before it 
was moved, and, while moving it, of the sound of each note, and of the 
force of each touch.  All the time the memory was remembering each note 
in its due time and place, and was exercised in the comparison of it 
with other notes that came before.  So that it would be fair to say 
there were no fewer than two hundred transmissions of nerve force 
outwards and inwards every second; and during the whole of the time, 
the judgment was being exercised as to whether the music was being 
played worse or better than before, and the mind was conscious of some 
of the emotions which some of the music was intended to impress." An 
appeal to the word <EM>automatism</EM> will not dispel the marvel of 
the performance.</P>

<p><A NAME="n_1">{1}</a> Hamilton says, "Consciousness and immediate knowledge are 
universally convertible terms: so that if there be an immediate 
knowledge of things external, there is consequently the consciousness 
of an outer world." <EM>(Discussions,</EM> p. 51.)</P> 

<p><A NAME="n_2">{2}</a> Hamilton makes some accommodation even for this wide usage: 
"Consciousness comprehends every cognitive act: in other words, 
whatever we are not conscious of, that we do not know.  But 
consciousness is an immediate cognition.  Therefore all our mediate 
cognitions are contained in our immediate." (<EM>Reid's Works,</EM> p.

without knowing <EM>what</EM> I know." Yet Reid's theory of 
consciousness as a distinct faculty does not commit him to the doctrine 
of unconscious thought, for the two faculties might always act in 
concert; on the other hand, Hamilton, who denies the duality of 
faculty, makes it his complaint that Reid had not studied, he even 
treats it as inconceivable, the Leibnitzian doctrine of what has not 
been well denominated <EM>obscure perceptions</EM> or <EM>ideas</EM> -- 
that is, acts and affections of the mind, which manifesting their 
existence in their effects are themselves out of consciousness or 
apperception." (<EM>Reid's Works,</EM> p. 55I.)</P>

<p><A NAME="n_27">{27}</a> Kant's doctrine on the necessary illusions of the reason, of 
which we have spoken before, certainly goes along with affirmations on 
his part that the faculties themselves are infallible, and that the 
illusions of reason are as corrigible as are the illusions of sense, 
such for example as that whereby the moon appears larger on the 
horizon, To this extent Kant is to be acquitted of the charge of making 
reason essentially erroneous.  It is to the judgment that Kant 
attributes error; and though we have seen Rosmini (Part I. c. ii.) 
quoting Kant as an author who makes judgment the one fundamental act 
of Understanding, we must remember that <EM>Understanding</EM> is not 
here co-extensive with the whole mind, but is distinguished from 
sensitive intuition on the one side, and from reason on the other. (Max
