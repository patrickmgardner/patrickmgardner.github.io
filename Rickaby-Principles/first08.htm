<P>THE next subject may be introduced by a character described in the 
<EM>Essays of Elia:</EM> "He hath been heard to deny that there exists 
such a faculty at all in man as reason, and wondereth how men first 
came to have the conceit of it -- enforcing his negation with all the 
might of reasoning he is master of. He has some speculative notions 
against laughter, and will maintain that laughter is not natural to 
him-when peradventure the next moment his lungs will crow like 
chanticleer.  It was he who said, upon seeing the Eton boys at play in 
their grounds, What a pity to think that these fine, ingenuous lads, in 
a few years, will all be changed into frivolous Members of 
Parliament!"</P> 

<P>The character of the sceptic has always been one of which jokers 
have made capital, and Lamb has taken his turn in the mockery.  Against 
the existence of a complete sceptic, as a fact of real life, those who 
themselves have been supposed to be far gone in the same malady, have 
clearly pronounced.  Hume<A HREF="#n_1"><sup><small>{1}</small></sup></a> says that such a being is imaginary, for 
speculative doubts give way utterly before the pressure of practical 
life.  Rather than have sceptics argued with, he would have them left 
alone, lest opposition should feed that perversity, which, abandoned to 
itself, would perish of its own weakness.</P> 

<P>I. Nevertheless we must do a little in the way of argument, if not 
with sceptics, then against scepticism; and we may take, as a division 
of the matter, what is given by Sextus Empiricus.  His account may not 
be historically accurate, but at least it furnishes two convenient 
headings under which to confute scepticism.  "Many persons," writes 
Sextus,<sup><small><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup> "confound the philosophy of the Academy with that of the 
Sceptics.  But although the disciples of the New Academy declare that 
all things are incomprehensible, yet they are distinguished from the 
Pyrrhonists in this very dogmatism. The Academicians affirm that all 
things are incomprehensible -- the Sceptics do not affirm even that. 
Moreover the Sceptics consider all perceptions perfectly equal as to 
the faithfulness of their testimony: the Academicians distinguish 
between probable and improbable perception." Here we have the 
suggestion of the partition of sceptics into dogmatic and non-dogmatic; 
those who make a dogma of their very doubt, saying that the one 
certainty is the uncertainty of all human opinions, and those who 
abstain from claiming even this one certitude.  It should be observed, 
however, that unless a sceptic were extra strange among a class of 
strange beings, he would hardly pretend to doubt the facts of his own 
consciousness -- that he had those feelings which he experienced.  What 
he would question would be the objective reality of his thoughts, not 
his subjective states as such.</P> 

<P>(a) The fatal act of the dogmatic sceptics is their profession to 
have strictly proved their conclusion, and to hold it positively as a 
valid inference.  Being, as John of Salisbury describes them, "Men 
whose whole endeavour is to prove that they know nothing,"<sup><small><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></small></sup> they 
elaborately argue out their case, and make quite a system of their 
views.</P> 

<P>Now their conclusion is either proved or not.  If it is not proved, 
then they have failed in their main object: if it is proved, then the 
many facts and principles, which went to build up the proof, are 
thereby declared invalid; for they imply a large mass of human 
certitudes.  In the premisses the sceptics appeal to observed facts, 
within and without their own persons: these facts they discuss in 
connexion with the principles of reason, and draw inferences.  Do they 
accept the observations and the principles as valid? If so, theirs 
cannot be the final conclusion to gather from them, for this 
conclusion, when drawn, at once turns round on the premisses and says, 
"Out upon you, you vile incapables, you are yourselves suspects, and 
can lead only to suspicious conclusions." The premisses retort, "That 
reproach does not come well from you." To affirm positively the 
invalidity of all reasoning, supposes a mind capable of a number of 
valid decisions: the one dogma of scepticism can never stand alone. 
The mistake of the dogmatic sceptics seems to be some lurking notion, 
that argument ending in denial need not imply fixed principles, but may 
be like simple nescience.  Possibly they look to some false analogy, 
like that of a drunken man, with just sense enough left to see that he 
cannot transact business, and had better seek retirement; or, again, 
like that of an insane man, who sufficiently perceives his own state, 
to beg that he may be taken to an asylum; or, lastly, like that of a 
constitutionally feeble intelligence aware of its own imbecillity.  In 
the inebriate, in the insane, in the imbecile, there may be 
intermittent gleams of right reason, and the examples form no true 
parallel to the case, in support of which they are supposed to be 
adduced.  A light shining faintly and fitfully through a cloud, does 
not illustrate the paradox of a light showing itself to be absolute 
darkness.</P> 

<P>The position of the dogmatic sceptics, when they have done and said 
all remains worse than that of the dumb man who tries to speak out and 
declare his own condition: or that of those who had to solve the old 
puzzle, how to believe, on a own testimony, that he is an unmitigated 
liar.  Concerning this latter knotty point, we are told that Chrysippus 
wrote six volumes, and that Philetas so overtaxed his energies as to 
die of consumption and deserve the epitaph:</P> 

<P>Stranger, Philetas am I; that fallacy called "The Deceiver,"<br>
Killed me, and here I sleep, wearied of lying awake.<sup><small><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></small></sup></P>

<P>The problem of dogmatic scepticism is calculated to prove equally 
killing. The dogmatic sceptic need not maintain his power to determine 
grades of probability; but since the New Academicians are said to have 
added this burden to their charge, and since the matter, when 
investigated, throws more light upon the position of scepticism, we 
shall do well to put in a word about the sceptic's probabilities. When 
a probability is declared by moralists to justify a certain course of 
conduct, they still admit that an action, only probably permissible, 
would be illicit: for a man is not allowed to act at a venture. But 
falling back upon a principle which they regard not as merely probable, 
but as certain, namely, that under some circumstances, where the 
obligation is not clear, it is no obligation at all, they succeed in 
establishing the maxim, <EM>Qui probabiliter agit, tuto agit.</EM> The 
safety is not simply in the probability, but in the certainty as to how 
they may act, where what stands in the way of action is only a 
probability against its being allowed.<sup><small><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></small></sup> What is thus illustrated in 
morals has an analogous illustration in intellectual matters.  Here 
also a probability requires the aid of some certainty.  To calculate 
probabilities and assign their several grades, needs a mind which 
knows, by its experience, how to discriminate the state of doubt from 
the state of certainty, and which has many certainties whereby to fix 
the probabilities.  It is simply ridiculous for dogmatic sceptics to 
claim that skill which the Academicians claimed, in the nice adjustment 
of a scale of probabilities.<sup><small><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>(b)  The non-dogmatic sceptics have the greatest difficulty in 
describing themselves, for they are not allowed definitively to declare 
anything, not even their universal scepticism.  One Greek philosopher 
tried to evade the difficulty by pointing out his meaning with his 
finger; but there is a limit to communication by this means, nor does 
the device exactly fulfil its purpose.  The boasted "dumbness" or 
"suspension of judgment"<sup><small><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></small></sup> cannot be maintained. Indeed, the non-
dogmatic sceptics make long discourses and write big books, in spite of 
the obvious objection, that in their case there is special force in the 
malicious wish, "O that mine enemy had written a book." To their books 
they try to sign the name of their school of thought.  Now without any 
insult to them, let us, merely as an illustration, compare their 
procedure with the case of the animal that is really an ass; how is 
the poor brute to write itself down accordingly? A bray is about the 
best sign it can give as "its mark." Similarly, a non-dogmatic sceptic, 
who for reasons set down in his book, takes up his position, is 
forbidden, by the very terms of his profession, to say positively what 
his intellectual stand-point is.  To say "I am a non-dogmatic 
sceptic," would be as clear a piece of dogmatism as to say, "I am a 
dogmatic sceptic;"  for it would imply that dogmatic scepticism was 
wrong, and that the right attitude was to be without any affirmation 
whatever.  Yet so to teach is itself an affirmation, resting on many 
others.</P> 

<P>Briefly, the non-dogmatic sceptic either keeps to his profession of 
inability to speak (<b>aphasia</b>) and affirms nothing, in which case 
there is nothing to refute, but at most we can complain of faculties 
unused; or else, breaking loose from his engagements, he makes an 
affirmation, and so refutes himself.  This suffices to end the general 
attack on the position of universal scepticism: attacks in detail must 
follow afterwards, as occasions successively offer themselves.</P> 

<P>2. The peculiar position of the <EM>Philosophy of Certitude</EM> is 
not appreciated by the sceptic.  Another science might be held to 
furnish its onvn refutation by presenting manifest contradictions; but 
there cannot, in the same way, be a sceptical refutation of the 
<i>Philosophy of Certitude</i>  by that philosophy itself, for there 
would no longer be an umpire left to give the award of victory or 
defeat.  If in a theory of light the application to phenomena of 
reflexion and refraction belies the application to phenomena of 
diffraction, then a mind is still by to judge of the contradiction, and 
of its fatal consequences to the theory: but if the very mind itself is 
to be proved essentially contradictory, how is it to establish the 
result? Mill<sup><small><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></small></sup> seems to share with the sceptics their want of 
appreciation for the position, when he writes: "If the reality of 
thought can be subverted, why is there any particular enormity in doing 
it by the means of thought itself? In what other way can we imagine it 
to be done?" Surely this argument is fallacious: because there is 
repugnancy in supposing anything but thought to work a certain effect, 
therefore there can be no repugnancy in supposing thought to work it.  
Mill, however, continues unembarrassed: " If it be true that thought is 
an invalid process, what better <i>proof</i> can be given, than that we 
could in thinking arrive at the conclusion, that our thoughts are not 
to be trusted? The scepticism would be complete even as to the validity 
of its own want of belief." As men, after execution, cannot sign a 
document testifying that sentence has been carried out neither can 
reason sign a valid testification to her own proof of her own universal 
invalidity.  A man may with one eye see that the other is hopelessly 
injured, whether he use a mirror for the purpose, or employ the faculty 
which a celebrated Greek philosopher is said to have possessed, of 
making the eyes converge till they looked into one another; but a 
single blind eye will never literally see its own destruction. Mill, 
though sometimes patronizing the man who never believed in dreams 
because he dreamt that he must not, yet in a better fram of mind 
himself confesses, that "denying all knowledge is denying none."</p>

<P>Hamilton is another ,who has let himself be caught in the same trap, 
when he puts hypothesis which he ought to have seen to be 
contradictory: " The mendacity of consciousness is <i>proved</i> if its 
data, immediately in themselves or mediately in their consequences, be 
shown to stand in mutual contradiction." Glad to agree with one from 
whom we often differ, we may let Mr. Spencer<sup><small><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></small></sup> answer here: "It is 
useless to say that consciousness is to be presumed trustworthy until 
proved mendacious. It cannot be proved mendacious in this primordial 
act, Nay, more, the very thing supposed to be proved cannot be 
expressed without recognizing the primordial act as valid; since, 
unless we accept the verdict of consciousness that they differ, 
mandacity and trustworthiness become identical," or at least not 
distinguishable. "Process and product of reasoning both disappear in 
the absence of this assumption."</p>

<P>3. Scepticism, being so clearly a sin against the right use of 
intelligence could not lawfully be paid as the price of rest from all 
anxious questionings, even if the bargain were possible.  But it is 
impossible.  For the complete sceptic is, as Mill<sup><small><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></small></sup> says, "an 
imaginary being," never to be actualized: while such scepticism as man 
can actualize, certainly doe not bring the promised quietude, or 
"absence disturbance" (<b>ataraxia</b>). The case is as with drink. If 
drink could perfectly drown care, still we ought not to turn drunkards: 
besides, drink does not effectually drown care, for it brings in its 
train alternations of great suffering.  Our true peace is to be sought 
in a right use of that reason, in which is the great root of our 
responsibility, and the alternative source of our highest happiness or 
misery.  And when we remember that our reason is not our own 
independent property, but a gift and entrusted talent we shall be far 
indeed from calling her calumniously, with Bayle, "the old destroyer," 
"the cloudgatherer," and far from adopting the pernicious sentiment of 
the verses:</p> 

<ul>
<P>Thinking is but an idle waste of thought<br> 
And nought is everything, and everything is nought.</P> 
</ul>

<P>Rather we shall recoil from intellectual nihilism as a Russian Czar 
abhors social nihilism: for the loss of all belief a intellect tends 
to paralyze action, and to take the energy out of life by robbing it of 
its hope.</P> 

<P>4.Unfortunately, though not going under the name of sceptics, but 
rather of agnostics, there is a large party of our philosophers in this 
country, who are pledged to the fundamental principles of scepticism in 
accepting substantially the doctrine of Hume.  The irresoluteness of 
their chief might warn them to distrust him.  While his principles are 
sceptical, he claims, in spite of them, to retain his belief: he finds 
comfort in setting up practice against theory, and declares, "as an 
agent I am not a sceptic:" he adds that there is no real sceptic.  
Ferrier goes so far as to suppose that Hume was not serious in his 
work, but was aiming at the <EM>reductio ad absurdum</EM> of the 
philosophic principles prevalent in the England of his day.  Dr.Symon, 
taking up a like view, says that Hume was "merely and undisguisedly 
sarcastic, and in jest, never in earnest, when he wrote on 
metaphysics." Even one who has no little sympathy with Hume, Mr. 
Bain,<sup><small><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></small></sup> declares, "As he was a man fond of literary effects, as well 
as of speculation, we do not always know when he is in earnest." The 
fair estimate of Hume seems to be, that he is not quite as bad as he 
appears: that many of his efforts were tentative: that he began to 
destroy, and then, alarmed at his own vandalism, set himself to build 
up again: that his avowed principles were sceptical, but that lie dared 
not, and could not, rush them to their extreme conclusions.  Hamilton 
tries, but not apparently with full success, to save Hume's consistency 
by the plea that to arrive at an inconsistency was the very object of 
his aim, it being "the triumph of scepticism to show that speculation 
and practice are irreconcilable."<sup><small><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></small></sup> In agreement with this view 
stands Hume's oft-quoted account of Berkeley's sceptical arguments, 
that they "admit of no answer, and produce no conviction."<sup><small><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></small></sup> Finally, 
Hume's recent editor, Professor Green, decides that "when we get behind 
the mask of concession to popular prejudice, partly ironical, partly 
due to his undoubted vanity, we find much more of the ancient sceptic 
than of the positive philosopher."<sup><small><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></small></sup> At any rate this is certain, 
that Hume should have no influence with a well balanced mind, which 
references itself as the greatest natural power upon earth, and as the 
only means of entering into moral communication with the highest Power 
of all.  Mind is our mightiest possession: <b>nous panta kratei</b>.</p>



<P><EM><CENTER>ADDENDA.</CENTER></EM> </P>

<P>A posthumous work, sent out in the name of the famous French Bishop, 
Huet, is a combination of the tenets of non-dogmatic scepticism with 
the assertion the dogmatically sceptical academics, that there are 
degrees of probability in our opinions about things.  There were not 
wanting in France, about his time, abundant seeds of scepticism, 
diffused by Montaigne, Charron, Francis Sanchez, Bayle, Pascal, and 
others.  Furthermore Huet might feel that he was not the first prelate 
to put forth the style of doctrine which he was maintaining; for about 
two centuries before, Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa, had written his works, 
<i>De Docta Ignorantia,</i> and <i>De Conjecturis,</i> to show the 
impotence of human reason, and to affirm the need of some sort of 
intuition of God.  Huet's <i>Feebleness of the Human Mind</i> appeals 
to isolated passages of Scripture, and of the Fathers, which seem, in 
their naked form, to give some countenance to the view, that man's 
intellect is incompetent, and that knowledge must be given from on 
high.  But these utterances, separated from their original 
accompaniments, ought to have been taken in their context, and with the 
light shed upon them from other passages, expressly declaring the 
prerogatives of human reason.  As to Scripture, it is its style not to 
put in qualifying clauses, but to take one side of truth and speak for 
the time as though this were the only side.  Now faith alone, now works 
alone, are spoken of as efficacious : the full truth being, when its 
elements are fused together, that works done in faith are requisite.  
The Fathers likewise do not think it always needful cautiously to 
balance one truth by its counterpart.</EM></P> 

<P>Huet thus endeavours to state his position of non-dogmatic 
scepticism: "In saying that nought is either true or false, I enunciate 
a proposition which refutes itself, as it is not excepted from the 
general law, which says that nothing is either true or false."<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> About 
sceptical arguments in proof of the position, he says: "They subvert 
other propositions, while subverting themselves, it is for this sole 
purpose they are enunciated, and not with a view to proving them."<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup> 
Other authors make the same statement in another shape, saying that 
scepticism is like a drug which purges out everything, itself 
included.</P> 

<P>Huet places what he conceives to be the superiority of his 
standpoint over that of ordinary mortals in this: "They know nothing, 
and we are aware of the fact, though we feel uncertain about our 
nescience.  Further, while they do not question our probability, we do 
deny to them the possession of the truth which they seek after."<sup><small><a href="#n_c">{c}</a></small></sup> The 
case is not so at all: for Huet cannot more vigorously deny to us our 
certitudes, than we deny to him his probabilities, if the probabilities 
are to be calculated on his principles.</P>
