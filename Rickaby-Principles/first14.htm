The Origin of Error in the Understanding.</h2></center><p><hr>

<P><EM>Synopsis.</EM><br>

<OL>

<LI>Ignorance the root of error.  How we begin in ignorance, slowly 
acquire some knowledge, but never cease to be in many ways 
ignorant.</LI>

<LI>The scholastic theory about error is, that the intellect is <EM>per 
se</EM> infallible, <EM>per accidens</EM> fallible: and that undue 
influence of the will is exerted in the case of error.</LI>

<LI>The scholastic theory taught outside scholasticism.</LI>

<LI>Supplementary considerations to complete the theory. (a) Dependence 
of the intellect on organic conditions, which are liable to 
disturbance. (b) The force of habit on the interpretation of sensation 
by the intellect. (c) The piecemeal, defective way in which we obtain 
evidence.</LI>

<LI>The scholastic theory re-stated and modified by the supplementary 
remarks.</LI>

<P><EM>Addenda.</EM></P><hr>

<P>THE next problem pressing for solution is to settle how, in spite of 
the fact that in evidence we possess an unerring criterion, yet we do 
err: so that intellectually, perhaps as much as morally, <EM>humanum 
est errare.</EM> The difficulty weighs heavier upon us than it would on 
those who, with Grote, believe that "no infallible objective mark, no 
common measure, no canon of evidence recognised by all, has yet been 
found." We who assert such a canon, have to explain how intellectual 
error is not only possible, but of constant occurrence, being sometimes 
practically inevitable.</P> 

<P>I. Ignorance is not itself error; but it lies at the root of error; 
inasmuch as, while an Omniscient Being cannot err because of His 
omniscience, a creature, because his knowledge is but partial, is 
exposed to the risk of forming false judgments.  It is the little 
knowledge that is the dangerous thing.<sup><small><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>We must, then, advert to the fact of our ignorance -- how we begin 
in blank ignorance, very slowly emerge from the universal darkness, and 
never reach the full blaze of knowledge complete.  Our knowledge is 
always a small sphere of illumination enclosed in an infinite sphere of 
obscurity; and the more the former grows, the more does its wider 
contact with what is without make it sensible of its own limitations.  
Consider our personal history.  For years the brain is not fit to serve 
the uses of higher intelligence: and when what is called the age of 
reason has arrived, long years of education are still needed to form 
the faculties into efficient working powers.  Again, when at the age of 
about twenty the condition of pupilage is over, a young man is told, as 
a parting piece of advice, that he is not a learned Doctor, but that he 
has the outfit necessary for setting about the work of becoming 
learned; and that even in its fully developed state, human learning is 
an ornament which is to be worn with a modest appreciation of its 
perfection.  Moreover, the knowledge which a man is said to have 
acquired is not always ready at need, as a schoolboy doing his Latin 
exercises will testify: and the knowledge that does not come up when 
wanted, is for the moment equivalently ignorance.  Such is the extent 
of our ignorance.</P> 

<P>2. Ignorance being supposed, the transition from it to error has to 
be studied: and in the course of our explanation we shall come across 
the promised account of how it is, that while judgment is defined as 
the full perception of the connexion between subject and predicate, yet 
judgments may be false.<sup><small><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup> It is the theory of the scholastics that 
intellect in man is <EM>per se</EM> infallible, <EM>per accidens</EM> 
fallible; or more accurately, <EM>per se non fallitur, per accidens 
fallitur.</EM> For it is <EM>per se</EM> fallible only inasmuch as, 
being <EM>per se</EM> a finite intelligence, it is of its own nature 
<EM>exposed to the possibility</EM> of going astray, but it does not 
simply of its own nature actually <EM>go astray.</EM> Similarly the 
finite will is <EM>per se</EM> peccable in so far as it is <EM>exposed 
to the possibility</EM> of sinning, not because <EM>per se</EM> it 
sins.  The intellect, as such, is moved only by its own proper object, 
which is evidence; and as evidence is the unfailing criterion of truth, 
the action of the intellect, strictly so called, is never erroneous.  
Intellect acting <EM>per se</EM> goes only by insight, and insight is 
always right.  Thus insight <EM>per se</EM> can no more assent to 
anything but truth, than the ear proper can be sensible to anything but 
sound.  But intellect, so far as it is subject to the undue action of 
the will, may be moved to go beyond or against the evidence it has at 
its disposal.  This theory will be defended as in substance correct, 
though it may be usefully supplemented with some further 
considerations, much urged by modern writers.  First, however, it may 
gain for itself a little more attention, if it is shown not to be an 
exclusive property of scholasticism, but to be owned likewise by 
thinkers of various classes.  A multiplicity of approvers may induce 
some not to pass over the theory in contempt.</P> 

<P>3. Hamilton was fond of quoting the line from Manilius -- whom we 
may take as our oldest witness, returning after a moment to Hamilton 
himself -- <EM>Nam neque decipitur ration, nec decipit unquam.</EM> 
Second in order we will take Descartes, who assuredly had no scruple in 
breaking loose from the scholastic bonds of his early educators, 
whenever it suited him.  He holds firmly to the doctrine that error 
springs from the bad use of the will, not from intellect left to 
itself.  In the first book of the <EM>Principia</EM> he writes:<sup><small><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></small></sup> 
"That we fall into error comes from defect, not in our nature as such, 
but in the employment of our powers, or in the use of our free-will.  
Since then we are aware that all our errors may be traced to the will, 
it may seem wonderful that we should ever be deceived, for nobody 
wishes to be deceived." Then he adds acutely: "But the will to be 
deceived is quite other than the will to assent to something which 
happens to involve error.  And though it be true that no one is willing 
to be deceived, there is hardly any one who does not will assent to 
what contains error, though he be not aware of it."<sup><small><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>Another Frenchman,<sup><small><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></small></sup> Cousin, writes: "Pure error is impossible, 
and quite unintelligible: for error makes its way into the mind only by 
means of the truth which it contains."</P> 

<P>Passing next to those who write in the English language, we may 
begin with the already promised quotation of Hamilton's opinion.<sup><small><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></small></sup> He 
holds that what we really and positively think cannot be erroneous, and 
that error is rather a want of intel. lectual action than an 
intellectual act.  Mansel<sup><small><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></small></sup> concurs with his master, and holds that 
"illogical thinking is no thinking at all." Dr. M'Cosh'<sup><small><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></small></sup> is another 
consentient witness I cannot keep from giving it as my decided 
conviction, that while ignorance may arise from the finite nature of 
our faculties, and from a limited means of knowledge, positive error 
does, in every case, proceed directly or indirectly from a corrupted 
(?) will, leading us to pronounce a hasty judgment without evidence, or 
to seek partial evidence on the side to which our inclinations lean.  A 
thoroughly pure and consistent will would, in my opinion, preserve us 
from all mistake." Finally, one who is not writing on philosophy shall 
join his voice to those of philosophers: "Mere sophisms or imperfect 
reasonings," says Mr. Lecky, "have a very small place in the history 
of human error; the intervention of the will has always been the chief 
cause of delusion."</P> 

<P>4. This view that the will is the cause of error, supported as it is 
by so many authors, may be supplemented by some considerations much 
urged by modern writers -- considerations which are, however, really 
supplementary, not contradictory to the theory propounded.</P>

<P>(a) One source of delusion is in the derangement of the nervous 
apparatus; and the nature of this perturbing action will require some 
detailed account.</P> 

<P>It is no new fact that a lesion in the material organ may result in 
stopping thought; and that on account of altered cerebral conditions a 
man maybe in any one of the countless gradations between sleep and 
wakefulness, or between sanity and insanity.  And as sleep has its 
dreams and insanity its delusions, so in the intermediate stages just 
mentioned there may be intermediate degrees of deceptiveness due to an 
abnormal state of nerves, Some people labour under the frequent 
recurrence of visual or auditory illusions, which they can calmly 
correct by data supplied through the other senses.  When the inflow of 
sensations from the ordinary channels is cut off, there are patients 
whose minds become quite deranged by their own subjective phantasies, 
and who are restored to composure only by being brought from darkness 
to light, and by having their several senses fed with their usual 
supplies.  They need the steadying influx of impressions from the outer 
world to prevent the inner life from upsetting its own balance.  An 
excitable man suddenly deprived of his hearing in a public 
thoroughfare, would often grow quite bewildered for want of his 
customary guidance from the ear: and still more would this be the case 
if the deprivation was effected, nbt merely through an external 
stopping of the ears, but through some inner disorder of the nerves.  
Thus in many ways a disturbance of the normal working of the nervous 
system has its result in a disturbance of the mind, and erroneous 
judgments not unfrequently follow.</P> 

<P>From the most general statement of the fact we may now come down to 
a particular law, which may be enunciated thus: Whenever in the brain 
extraordinary causes which are internal excite those pbenomena which 
ordinarily are excited by familiarly known objects, there is a tendency 
erroneously to judge those objects to be present, though in reality 
they are not.  Sometimes it is the vehemence of an idea which excites 
the sensible image, and at once the object is as if bodily present at 
other times the action is rather from below upwards, and the abnormally 
roused sense-images call up their corresponding ideas.  Here we are 
safe in asserting that we have an undoubted occasion for an erroneous 
judgment, as for example when the vivid thought of a departed friend 
has brought up his image in the brain, and he is declared to have been 
seen.  Some, though not all, ghost stories may be so explained.</P>

<P>(b) Again, there is a second special law of delusion through the 
senses, the law of <EM>the accidental miscarriage of customary 
interpretation;</EM> and it differs from the first in not implying any 
internal derangement of the nerves.  Ordinarily, what we actually at 
any time perceive is the merest item, compared with all that is at once 
filled into the object by inference or association.  We catch sight of 
a plume and we at once supply a hearse; we observe a wheel moving, and 
we supply the whole carriage and its occupants.  An odour leads us to 
assert the presence of oranges or lemons; a sound the presence of an 
organist and his instrument; a touch a broken bone beneath its muscular 
covering.  The practical necessities of life drive us to make these 
short cuts by the aid of incomplete inference; for if we stopped fully 
to verify everything, we could not get through one tithe of our 
business.  As a rule, our customary inferences from few data are right, 
but every now and then they are wrong; and whoever cares to play us a 
practical joke may probably succeed in doing so, if under familiar 
appearances he will present to us an object not usually associated with 
them in our experience.  In the examples given above, while we do not 
say that the unusually produced sensations or sense-images are errors, 
we must say that they may be occasions of error, and sometimes of error 
practically unavoidable.</P> 

<P>This is the moderate statement of the case, and contrasts with the 
immoderate statement of M. Taine:<sup><small><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></small></sup> "The two principal processes 
employed by nature to produce what we call acts of cognition, are the 
creation of illusions within, and their rectification.  It is a point 
of capital importance that external perception is a true hallucination.  
When sense-objects really impress us we have first the sensations, 
which an hallucinated person has without real objects.  The external 
perception is an internal dream, which proves to be in harmony with 
outer things.  We have, when awake, a series of hallucinations, which 
do not become developed.  This hallucination which seems a monstrosity, 
is the very fabric of our mental life.  Nature deceives to instruct us.  
In recollection a present image is taken for a past sensation. just as, 
in external perception, simple, internal phantasms are taken for 
external objects, so in memory we see simple present images taken for 
past sensations, but corresponding by a beautiful mechanism to the 
exterior presence of real sensations.  The history of sleep and of 
madness gives us the key to the waking state." Mr. Sully<sup><small><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></small></sup> has some 
remarks of somewhat like tendency, when he is speaking of the region of 
hallucination as a border-land between reason and insanity, or rather 
as forming the extreme confines in which these two regions are, as it 
were, blended.  He adds that "in perfect normal perception we find in 
the projection of our sensations of colour, sound, and the rest, into 
the environment or to the extremities of the organism, something which, 
from the point of view of physical science, easily wears the appearance 
of an ingredient of illusion." We may be pardoned, if in place of other 
answer to these authors we refer once more to the force which habit has 
in misleading us; for herein will be found the solution of the ordinary 
sense-illusions.<sup><small><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></small></sup> Those who reduce all judgments to repeated 
associations of ideas, naturally make much more of this source of error 
than we can allow; but we can allow that it is a source.</P> 

<P>(c) Lastly, the criterion of evidence often fails to secure us from 
error, because we get our evidence piecemeal, in insufficient amount, 
and often with only indirect bearings.  If the evidence of each case 
were one simple thing, we should run no risk; but, as was observed in 
the last chapter, we usually have to deal with a complicated mass of 
evidences in the plural.</P> 

<P>5. Examining next how the scholastic theory can accommodate the 
three supplementary considerations, we note first that all three 
elements, at least indirectly, come under the control of will, to a 
large extent. By force of will we can often resist or correct abnormal 
conditions of the sensitive system, and by force of will we can 
aggravate these conditions.  Again, will has a large share as well in 
forming our intellectual habits, as in checking them.  Lastly, will has 
its influence in setting us carefully, cautiously, and restrainedly to 
judge from complicated evidences, or in urging us precipitately to 
force a conclusion.</P> 

<P>While, however, these several conditions are controlled by will, 
they have distinct influences of their own; and this is the reason why 
the theory, that error is due to will, seems not complete, unless they 
too receive special mention as factors of the whole.</P> 

<P>In what sense, therefore, from our larger survey of the position, 
can we admit Hamilton's dictum, that "No error can be really 
thought?"<sup><small><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></small></sup> Are we to say, that he who honestly mistakes his 
neighbour's hat for his own, does not really think it his own? Not so; 
but what we may assert is, that in his way of forming this judgment 
there were some steps taken in which thought was a blank.  The man 
never really thought out all the steps to the conclusion -- "This hat 
is my own." He thought out part and filled in the rest by force of 
habit, association, or rash inference. And the like may be affirmed of 
every case of error.  A man has worked out a long mathematical problem: 
he assents to the conclusion, but not from clear insight of what is 
involved in it; his assent is given in trust that his working out of a 
long process was right at each step.  But some step or steps there must 
have been which he never represented in thought, and so "the error was 
not really thought."</P> 

<P>Somewhat in the spirit of these last explanations, it has been said, 
that if the old astronomers had only stated the limits under which they 
were speaking, their statements would have been correct.  They assumed 
that there was an absolute upside, opposed to an absolute downside: 
they assumed that men could not stand on the earth if it were placed 
upside down: from these premisses their inference was valid, that the 
earth could not be revolving.  From the hypothesis of a stationary 
earth, they rightly inferred the motion of the sun.  Thus they never 
fully thought out the real problem, but an ideal problem which was 
consistent with itself.  Not thought, but something else, carried them 
over some parts of their argument when they applied it to the actual 
system: but if they had put in their limits, then their view would have 
been hypothetical and right.  Instead of taking the absolute form, "The 
earth is fixed, the sun revolves round it," their astronomy would have 
taken a hypothetical shape, "If certain suppositions are true, then 
the earth is fixed and the sun revolves round it."</P> 

<P>To put the whole of this part of our doctrine summarily: the error 
assented to is either a contradiction in terms, and then it is clear 
that it has never been strictly an object of thought, or it is an error 
in a contingent matter, and then the final result may in some sense be 
said to be an object of thought, but at least its actuality has never 
properly been thought out to the full.  We may really think that X was 
intoxicated when he was not; but we have never followed out in thought 
all the evidences for the fact.  At some point, not thought, but 
another power, has effected a part of the process.</P> 

<P>In this way Hamilton's saying, which is in conformity with the 
scholastic theory of error, if not made to mean more than it 
necessarily implies, expresses a useful doctrine.  It corresponds to 
that which Descartes probably meant when he said that, if he was only 
careful always to follow clear ideas, and nothing else, he could never 
go wrong.  Unfortunately he did not describe properly the criterion of 
clear ideas; but we may add the explanation, that clear ideas must mean 
insight into objective truth. Insisting on this insight, we necessarily 
assign a very different account of the genesis of error from that which 
is assigned by those who treat only of the mechanism or chemistry of 
ideas; of associations and dissociations, of affinities and repulsions 
between mental atoms.  Once more it is seen how a philosophical 
explanation is dependent on the radical nature of a system; and how the 
followers of Hume are in their whole point of view at variance with 
truth.  A theory so erroneous as Hume's can never render the right 
account of error, though it may serve as an illustration of it to an 
expounder who goes on true principles.  On these true principles we 
have laid down our theory, that ignorance is a condition, but is never 
by itself alone the efficient cause of error, and never identical with 
error: that the ignorant mind is necessarily <EM>fallible,</EM> but not 
with the same necessity <EM>actually false:</EM> that the man who 
labours under incomplete and obscure ideas is essentially <EM>exposed 
to the danger</EM> of judging wrong, but does not so essentially 
<EM>judge wrong in fact;</EM> that habits and associations incline us 
to assert more than is in the evidence before us; and finally that the 
will exerts its power to urge on acts of assent or dissent, which the 
mere intellect of itself would not have made, because these being 
untrue, are not fit objects to decide an intellectual movement. The 
grossest mistake must have some element of truth in it; and "falsehood 
is dangerous only from its possessing a certain portion of mutilated 
truth." Thus evidence itself helps to elicit the erroneous judgment; 
but it is precisely because, besides evidence, there are other forces 
at work, that the total result is a failure.</P> 

<P>ADDFNDA.</P>

<P>(1) In saying that our ignorance is infinite compared with our 
knowledge, we must be taken as referring, to the <EM>details</EM> which 
in any concrete enunciation are left to be filled in: for, of course, 
under the <EM>generalized</EM> terms Being, Substance and Accidents, 
God and Nature, we include all things in our knowledge.</P> 

<P>(2) When distinguishing will from intellect, we require no more than 
such a distinction as all admit who allow that to know a thing is not 
the same as to wish it.  This leaves quite intact the question whether 
the several faculties of the soul have a real distinction <EM>inter 
se,</EM> and from the soul to which they belong. Some of our modern 
English writers assert that every mental act contains an element of 
<EM>thought, feeling,</EM> and <EM>volition,</EM> the three 
constituents of mental life.  It may be true that the intellect never 
embraces truth, which the will does not somehow, at the same time, 
embrace, at least for its truth's sake, though under other respects the 
will dislikes the object intensely.  Yet, on no account could we admit 
the Malebranchian theory, that the assent in a judgment is the act, not 
of the intellect, but of the will.</P> 

<P>(3) A further question is whether the action of the will in error is 
always free.  Suarez<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> speaks as though it were; but allows such a 
<EM>minimum</EM> of freedom sometimes as would save from moral guilt.  
In accordance with his teaching, we hold the existence of countless 
limitations upon that freedom, especially in what are called "first 
motions of the will," the <EM>motus primo primi</EM> of theologians.  
Very often, at any rate, our errors are proximately or remotely due to 
an abuse of freedom: but we may refrain from saying, that they are so 
always.

<P>(4) The importance of the power of will in determining judgment has, 
besides a high speculative, an equally high moral importance.  It is an 
undoubted fact, that the erroneous judgments of many persons are most 
culpable.  We have only to note what an abatement of assertions there 
is, as soon as an ordinary talker is brought to book, and as it were 
put on his oath, to infer how very rash are a great mass of human 
assents.  It is said that many would sooner have their good will than 
their sound judgment called in question: they prefer to confess a 
culpable negligence rather than an inculpable mistake.  But the two 
departments are connected; so that a man cannot constantly be guilty of 
great wilfulness in his judgments, without intrinsically damaging his 
very power to know the truth.  In the interest of his intellectual 
faculty itself he must exercise a most vigilant use of his will, as a 
determinant of his assent.</P> 

<hr>

<p><A NAME="n_1">{1}</a> There is a certain semblance of truth in the caution given by 
Rousseau: "Remember, always remember, that ignorance has never done any 
harm, and that only error is mischievous; that a man is riot led astray 
by what he does not know, but by what he wrongly fancies that he 
knows." (<EM>Emile,</EM> Lib. III. in initio.) In a later passage 
towards the end of the same Book III., he returns to the subject: he 
says that all our errors come from judging; if only we had no need to 
judge, we should avoid error, and should be happier in our ignorance 
than our knowledge can make us.  He thinks that learned men have less 
of truth than the unlearned, because each truth that they take up is 
accompanied with a hundred false judgments; so that the most famous of 
our learned societies is only a school of falsehood, and there are more 
mistakes in the Academy of Sciences than among a body of Hurons. "Since 
then the more men know the more they fall into mistakes, the only way 
to escape error is ignorance.  Never judge, and you will never deceive 
yourself.  This is the lesson of Nature as well as of reason." He adds, 
however, that as circumstances force us to form judgments, we had 
better study how to form them rightly.</P>
