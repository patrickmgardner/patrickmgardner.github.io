<P>I. THE doubters with whom we have just been dealing make doubt 
their final goal, they doubt and rest there: but we have now to deal 
with a universal doubt which is supposed to be a means of helping on 
the mind towards well-assured knowledge.  Hence it is called 
<EM>methodic</EM> doubt, as Being only a way, or rather part of a way, 
to an end, not an end in itself.  Descartes who, it should be 
remembered, gives warning that his system is dangerous for all but the 
few, is the deviser of this method of doubt, which has won for him more 
credit with some people than close investigation of its merits will 
bear out.  The fact is, Descartes says many things that are either 
quite true, or contain an obvious element of truth; and, in his replies 
to objections, he may seem to get over certain difficulties which, if 
reference were made back to his system, would be found to be 
insuperable.  But of course few readers, go to the trouble of making 
such reference, and so, the author is the gainer. Even a well-informed 
writer like Hamilton<sup><small><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></small></sup>, speaks of the error of Descartes as accidental 
rather than substantial; whereas his error is substantial and the 
admixture of truth incidental.  There are other critics who, to less 
attentive readers, may appear to approve, in the main, of Descartes, 
yet who, if read more carefully, will be found to disagree with him 
fundamentally.  Instances are Balmez, Sanseverino, and Tongiorgi.  
However, our business is much more to refute the popular version of 
Cartesianism, than to score a victory over one long since dead and 
beyond the reach of our weapons; so that to us it is a matter of small 
consequence, whether a wide collation of passages might not do 
something to mitigate the crudeness of the system, when taken in 
outline.</P> 

<P>2. What the snatch-and-away class of readers would seize upon in 
Descartes is just what is most plausible and insidious.  The surface of 
his doctrine looks fair, and the prominent parts are easily grasped.  
He finds that his mind is like a basket containing apples, good and 
bad: and he proposes to empty the whole out, and put back only the 
good.  Certainly a very natural thing to do, if the mind is a basket of 
apples.  But so patently is the mind not a basket of apples, that a 
directly opposite course of, action has suggested itself to others.  
Thus Cardinal Newman has declarations to the effect that, if he were 
driven to choose between the two extreme alternatives, be would rather 
begin by holding all present beliefs, and gradually letting go the 
untenable, than start with the clean sweep made by universal doubt.  
And this process Wundt actually recommends, so far as he teaches, that 
instead of beginning from the idealist point of view, men should first 
hold their ideas to be real: then they should eliminate what can be 
shown to be merely subjective, and keep the residue as objective.  Thus 
the analogy of the basket is catching indeed to an average reader; but 
catching in the way of that now forbidden article, the man-trap.</P> 

<P>3. In three different places of his works, Descartes describes the 
successive steps of his system;  yet to inquire what precisely this 
system is, seems hardly to enter seriously into the minds of ordinary 
retailers of philosophic opinions.  Perhaps they are secretly led by 
the principle which we have seen Mr. Pollock avow, namely, that 
"systems" are nothing, but a few "vital ideas" everything.  With regard 
to Descartes, any one who will carefully compare his threefold account 
of his system, will be quite convinced that the author had not steadily 
made up his mind how the several steps in the progress were to succeed 
each other.  The <EM>Discourse on Method,</EM> Part IV., the 
<EM>Meditations,</EM> especially the first, and the <EM>Principia</EM> 
(Part I. in initio), would not quietly fuse together into a 
<EM>Summa,</EM> though they are meant to be three descriptions of one 
leading process.  However, in the destructive part of this process, 
Desca  es is pretty uniform: and it is this part chiefly which we must 
assail, destroying the destroyer.</P> 

<P>4.The philosopher soliloquises somewhat in this strain: I, being now 
in the maturity of my faculties, find that the formation of my opinions 
has hitherto been not at all critically conducted; and whereas it would 
be endless to test each of my beliefs separately, therefore I must aim 
at some comprehensive method.  Recurring to my reasons for 
dissatisfaction, I find that my senses have often deceived me, and 
therefore as means of knowledge they are to be suspected: which 
suspicion is immediately extended to the rest of my knowledge, so far 
as it has its beginning in the senses.  But my intellect itself is open 
to direct assault: it too has been deceived in matters when I felt 
quite sure, and I can doubt even about mathematical truths, which are 
considered as types of clearness.  Next as to grounds of misgiving 
which are extrinsic to my own faculties, sensitive and intellectual; 
whence have I these faculties? I am told that I have them from an 
Omnipotent Creator: and if He is Omnipotent, He can do all things, and 
consequently He can make me essentially a creature of delusions.  Or 
suppose I am the work of a maker less than omnipotent; then all the 
more likely is the less powerful maker to have made me ill.  But 
perhaps this is irreverent: so let us suppose it is some spirit that is 
perpetually turning me to mockery. Thus on all sides I find my very 
faculties untrustworthy, and trying to doubt, I can doubt the existence 
of my body and its senses, of earth and heaven: "and finally I am 
driven to admit that there is nothing of what I previously believed 
which I cannot in some way doubt: and this not lightly and 
inconsiderately, but because of very strong and well-weighed 
reasons."</P> 

<P>It is not extravagant to hope the reader will allow, that the way to 
criticize the above "method" is not simply to look out for some stray 
"vital ideas" which it may contain, but to look to the whole method of 
which a part has just been sketched, and ask, can the proposed whole 
admit of that part. Descartes is not arguing in behalf of permanent 
doubt: else he would be one of the dogmatic sceptics refuted in the 
last chapter: he is arguing for doubt as a preliminary to certitude, 
and this fact is vital to his <EM>system,</EM> whatever may be the 
"vitality of ideas" out of systematic connexion with each other.  Now 
as a system Descartes' method fails, if his principles of destruction 
are inconsistent with any subsequently applied principles of 
reconstruction.  He first doubts in order afterwards to be certain: he 
does not indeed try to draw certitude out of doubt itself; but he does 
try to start from a state of doubt on the way to certitude.  Hume<sup><small><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup> 
and Reid agree that he has so buried himself beneath the ruins of the 
edifice he has pulled down, that rebuilding is beyond the power of the 
utterly crushed enterpriser.</P> 

<P>5. If it were necessary, for purposes of refuting his "method," to 
follow Descartes into all the details of his arguments, we should 
require at once to enter upon such special subjects as the 
trustworthiness of the senses, the nature of mathematical truths, the 
nature of necessary truth, the regulation of Divine omnipotence by 
Divine wisdom and goodness, the permission of evil, the powers of 
wicked spirits in face of a Provident Ruler, and other large questions.  
But there is a shorter way: Descartes, falls into the inconsistencies 
of the universal sceptics, and is logically forced to abide with those 
in whose company he is unwilling to remain.  He professes to be able, 
"seriously and for well-weighed reasons," to doubt the validity of his 
faculties, and truths which present themselves to his mind with the 
force of evidence.  Out of such doubt there is no rescue.  A man so 
circumstanced has no right even to his "I think, therefore I exist" 
(<EM>Cogito, ergo sum</EM>); and if he says that on this point doubt is 
impossible, he says so only by revoking what he had said before; for if 
his whole nature may be radically delusive, it may be delusive here.  
He says the doubter cannot doubt his own existence: but neither can the 
doubter doubt consistently the validity of his own faculties and of 
evident propositions.  Some have so bemuddled themselves that they have 
felt alarmed as to their own existence; and a large system of pantheism 
denies the reality of the separate <i>Ego</i>.  If this bemuddlement is 
a degree worse than that of Descartes, the question is only one of 
degree, not of kind.  It is substantially the same kind of evidence 
which testifies that I exist, and that what I know, I know, or that my 
faculties are veracious.  A man may and must start from ignorance, and 
by the experience of his intellectual life first discover, empirically, 
that he is an intelligent being: also a man may gradually test by 
experience that he is waking up from a dream or from a delirium.  But 
no man, from the position of what Descartes styles the proved 
suspiciousness of his very power of knowing anything, can coolly go on 
to use his suspected faculties as witnesses in their own behalf, when 
they say <EM>Cogito, ergo sum.</EM> The only irrefragability of 
Descartes, at this point, is the convincing evidence of his maxim on 
other principles than the Cartesian, not on Cartesian principles.</P> 

<P>There is, however, one point stated in the last paragraph which 
ought not to be left without further notice; and it is that some 
defence may apparently be made for Descartes, inasmuch as he places the 
certainty of self above the certainty of ordinary truths which are 
immediately evident.  A large number of philosophers have remarked that 
our own states of consciousness, and a knowledge of <EM>some kind</EM> 
of self, are matters beyond all question: whereas at least a question 
may be raised as to whether our thoughts in general stand for any 
objects beyond themselves.  The absolute unquestionableness on the one 
side, and the possible questionableness on the other, seem at first 
sight to rest on a well-grounded distinction: but closer inspection 
will not bear out first impressions.  For if we push scepticism 
concerning truths other than the truth of our consciously modified self 
to their logical conclusions, we shall find ourselves reduced to the 
inability of making any certain declaration whatever.  We shall be as 
ill off as Mill<sup><small><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></small></sup> when he admitted the <EM>necessity of deductions</EM> 
from axiomatic truths, but denied the <EM>necessity of the axioms:</EM> 
as though the evidence for one were not as compelling.as the evidence 
for the other, and as though reasoning could have a prerogative over 
immediate intuition.  If Hume<sup><small><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></small></sup> is any support, we have him as an ally 
in the present instance; for he denies to Descartes that there is "any 
original principle which has a prerogative over others," such as 
the <EM>Cogito ergo sum</EM> is asserted to have.  Allow Descartes' 
principles to the full, and instead of your fixed certainty that you, 
the doubter, exist, you will find yourself muttering some verses of 
Byron, which one sees occasionally quoted:</P> 

<p>So little do we know what we're about in<br> 

This world, that I doubt if doubt itself be doubting.<br> 

O doubt, if thou be'st doubt, for which some take thee,<br>

But which I doubt extremely, &c.</P> 

<P>These expressions are wild utterances, but Descartes has no right to 
complain of them, and he ought to have realized the startling fact.</P> 

<P>Yet so easily do certain minds isolate "vital ideas," that some 
speak as though the whole onslaught against Descartes was because he 
stood up vigorously for the fact of self-existence, as revealed in 
thought and as a primary cognition! We all, stand up in defence of that 
piece of knowledge; our quarrel is with the previous scepticism.  We 
would wipe out from Descartes' system other things besides, but first 
of all, that which most strongly characterizes it, its initial stage of 
universal doubt; ignoring which the "good easy reader" of reports at 
second hand, seems to be under the delusion, that Descartes merely said 
we had reasons for dissatisfaction with our early way of laying up 
mental stock, and that the stock in hand should, in mature years, be 
thoroughly overhauled.  Descartes teaches a great deal more than that: 
he claims to have proved, by reasons, that mathematical evidence may be 
fallacious, and that so may be our very inmost nature.  Do not overlook 
this essential part of the system, if you would be anything like a 
competent critic: and do not fail to notice how such a beginning is 
absolutely fatal to further progress.</P> 

<P>On the principles involved in his "methodic doubt" alone, Descartes 
would find defence impossible; but he labours under the further 
disadvantage, that there are principles, in other parts of his 
philosophy, which serve to cripple him very much, and render it still 
more difficult for him ever to recover his certitudes.  Truth, 
according to Descartes,<sup><small><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></small></sup> rests ultimately on the Divine free-will: 
and had God so chosen, our necessary truths might have been the reverse 
of what they are.  This is a very different thing from saying, that God 
could have given to us, or to other beings having our place, a palate 
which enjoyed oil of vitriol, and a stomach which could digest aconite; 
in all which assertions there is no clear contradiction.  But to assert 
that God could have reversed, not merely physical arrangements, but 
also metaphysical principles, is to strike at the root of all truth and 
of all knowledge, and to annihilate the difference between truth and 
falsehood.  Truth is no longer a sacred thing; and that God should use 
His omnipotence to deceive us, no longer admits of disproof.  In fact 
nothing admits of proof or disproof, for that which both aim at ceases 
to have a meaning.</P> 

<P>6. As to the constructive part of the Cartesian system, we need only 
note its futility.  In some accounts, next to his first great fact, 
<EM>Cogito ergo sum,</EM> he places a criterion of truth derived from 
the experience of this fundamental certitude.  This last is accepted 
because it is contained in clear and distinct ideas: hence is derived 
the criterion: "That is true which is contained in clear and distinct 
ideas." But in other places Descartes pronounces the criterion, so 
obtained, to be invalid an invalidity which some might suppose him to 
limit to the external world until we have settled, that the faculty 
which has the clear and distinct ideas is from God, who cannot create 
lying powers of mind.  Onward, therefore, to the proof of God's 
existence Descartes hastens: and argues in a circle, that God exists 
because our clear ideas affirm it, and our clear ideas validly make the 
affirmation because God is their voucher.  Few who praise Descartes as 
the philosopher of "clear thought," care to look into his theory of 
"clear ideas:" and from that theory their own opinions. are utterly 
dissentient.  Yet it is a fact that often a doctrine cannot be 
understood till its meaning is made to square with its context, and it 
is ridiculous to pretend to be in admiring agreement with an author, 
when really you and he are radically at disagreement, and when be does 
not decisively know his own mind.  As a system Cartesianism is quite 
without supporters: and this is a fact -- a most important fact -- 
which a careful examination cannot fail to reveal to fancied 
adherents.</P> 

<P>7. The general estimate of Descartes is by some put very high, by 
others much lower.  Buckle, not a great authority on abstract sciences, 
is quite in the characteristic vein of the <EM>History of 
Civilization,</EM> when he calls Descartes "the Luther of Philosophy," 
who "believed, not only that the mind by its own effort could root out 
its most ancient opinions, but that it could, without fresh aid, build 
up a new and solid system.  It is this extraordinary confidence in the 
power of the human intellect which gives this philosophy that sublimity 
which distinguishes it from all other systems." If Buckle had known 
more of what he was talking about, be would have been checked by the 
reflexion, that Descartes, in places where he brings forward his half-
hearted theory of innate ideas, goes very near, at times, to denying 
the intellect's power of forming its own conceptions, and to declaring 
it wholly dependent upon infused ideas; that he takes away from us any 
natural means of passing from sensations to thoughts; that he makes all 
our certitude rest on the knowledge of God as the Author of life   
faculties, whilst this idea of God he makes necessarily dependent on a 
Divine communication.</P> 

<P>The real position of Descartes seems to be, that he brought into 
prominence some useful doubts and some useful conceptions, which others 
carried to better issue than he did, and in this respect he not a 
little resembles Bacon; also that he started some dangerous ideas, 
which again others carried to worse issue than he did.  It is of the 
latter that Bossuet, himself a sort of Cartesian, wrote: "To conceal 
nothing from you, I see that a tremendous conflict threatens the 
Church, under the name of Cartesian philosophy.  I see that more than 
one heresy will spring from its principles, though, as I believe, from, 
their wrong interpretation."<sup><small><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>The mathematical services of Descartes were admittedly great, 
especially his share in the invention of analytical geometry; and in 
the physical sciences he is quite welcome to whatever honours his 
friends can vindicate for him; it is only his,"methodic doubt" that is 
here expressly condemned.  Yet in regard to science as distinguished 
from philosophy, it may be noted that Whewell, in his <i>History of the 
Inductive Sciences,</i> lodges against him such charges as, that he 
misstated the third. law of motion; that he claimed to himself 
discoveries of Galileo and others, which cannot be allowed to one who 
"did not understand, or would not apply, the laws of motion which he 
had before him;" that "if we compare Descartes with Galileo, then of 
the mechanical truths which were easily obtainable in the beginning of 
the seventeenth century, Galileo took hold of as many, and Descartes of 
as few, as was possible for a man of genius;" that "in his physical 
speculations Descartes was often very presumptuous, though not more 
than half right," that he would not question nature, being ambitious of 
showing not simply what is, but what must be.  These accusations may, 
or may not be justified, as far as we are concerned; our one great 
accusation is, that Descartes attempted the impossible, in trying to 
build up a system after giving positive reasons for the conclusion, 
that his faculties might be radically incompetent.</P> 

<P><EM><CENTER>ADDENDA.</CENTER></EM> </P>

<P>(1) As an additional example of the mischief which comes of not 
viewing Descartes' words in their context, and every philosopher's 
words in their context, it is instructive to observe how falsely St. 
Augustine has been quoted as a precursor of Descartes.  St. Augustine 
does indeed use the very valid argument, that the existence of self is 
invincibly brought home to the conscious individual, and that it is 
asserted even in the act of doubting.  But St. Augustine does not 
preface the argument by a suicidal declaration of scepticism, nor does 
he fall into the vicious circle of proving reason from God, and God 
from reason.  Without first taking himself the fatal cathartic of 
universal doubt, but arguing against the possibility of universal 
doubt, he has passages like these: "If a man doubts, he lives; if he 
doubts that he doubts, he understands.  If he doubts, it is because he 
wants to be certain. If he doubts, he thinks.  If he doubts, he is 
conscious of his ignorance.  If he doubts, he deems that he ought not 
to assent, save on reasonable grounds."<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> "You who wish for a 
knowledge of yourself, do you know your own existence? Yes, I do." "How 
do you know it?" "That I don't know." "Do you know whether you are 
simple or complex?" "No." "Do you know that you have the power of 
motion?" "No." Do you know that you are capable of thought ? " 
"Yes."<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup> Finally, "Without any delusive phantasm of the imagination, I 
am certain that I am, that I know and love.  As regards these truths, I 
have no fear of the arguments of the Academics who may object: but what 
if you are deceived? If I am deceived, I am." <sup><small><a href="#n_c">{c}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>Not one of the quotations sanctions universal scepticism as a 
prelude to philosophic certainty.</P> 

<P>(2) By the side of Descartes' theory it is interesting to place the 
view of Cousin,<sup><small><a href="#n_d">{d}</a></small></sup> that the possible forms of philosophy are four, 
sensism and idealism, each leading to scepticism, which in turn has for 
its reaction mysticism.   He denies that scepticism can come first, 
being necessarily preceded by dogmatism, either sensistic or 
idealistic.  "Negation is not the starting-point of the human mind, as 
it pre-supposes that there is something to be denied, hence something 
that has previously been affirmed.  Affirmation is the first act of 
thought.  Man, therefore, begins with belief, belief in this or that; 
and so the first system is dogmatic.  Its dogmatism is either sensist, 
or idealistic according as the thinker trusts respectively thought or 
the experience of the senses.  Mysticism marks the despair of the human 
mind, when after having naturally believed in itself, and started with 
dogmatism, it takes refuge from scepticism in pure contemplation, and 
the immediate intuition of God.</P> 

<P>Such is the necessary sequence of systems of thought in the human 
mind."<sup><small><a href="#n_e">{e}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>(3) Descartes is a warning against over-confidence in self for the 
working out of a new system.  He complained that philosophy presented 
the appearance of a city built by many hands at different times; and he 
argued that a symmetrical whole required unity of workmanship.  He 
tried himself to be the single workman, who should build up the whole 
of an enormous city, after first pulling down the old structures; but 
in both respects his efforts were failures, monumental failures for the 
warning of posterity.  In a matter so open to human thought as the 
nature of its own certitude, no man of proper modesty should venture 
upon the boast; Heretofore the world has gone wrong, but at last 
<i>ecce ego!</i> Even the gentle Ferrier ventures to claim a few of 
these downright new discoveries; but they are, of course, all 
delusions: and of Comte, who cased to read other philosophers in order 
to develop his own thought, Mill says that he developed "a colossal 
self-conceit."</P>
