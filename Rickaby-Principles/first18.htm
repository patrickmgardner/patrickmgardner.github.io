<P>1. THE error, which is often confounded with the realism defended in 
the last chapter, is the doctrine of exaggerated realism. Any theory 
which asserts a formal universality <EM>a parte rei,</EM> which 
supposes, for example, that there is some concrete nature physically 
common to all men, and only accidentally individuated in each, must be 
rejected as wanting even in intelligibility.  Such cases as that of 
substance permanent under its varying activities and passivities, are 
in vain quoted as examples of universality <EM>a parte rei</EM>: while 
Cousin's assertion, that space is a real universal, shows him to have 
entertained crooked notions either about space or about universals.  No 
pretended instance can stand testing: and if some mediaeval 
philosophers thought otherwise, we give them up and say, they were 
mistaken; but it hardly becomes certain modern critics to make merry at 
the expense of the middle ages, when they themselves are in favour of 
<EM>monism,</EM> a single underlying reality, of which all that we 
experience, and we ourselves, are but the phenomena.</P> 

<P>2. (a) In extreme opposition to the exaggerated realist is 
the nominalist, who, if thorough-going, places universality in the name 
only.  Not that nominalists deny a real likeness between things, for 
that is too obvious to be gainsaid; and Mill finds fault with Hamilton, 
whom he supposes to hold that such likeness is denied.  Hobbes, a 
notorious nominalist, says clearly enough, that "one universal name is 
imposed on many things <EM>for the similitude in some quality or other 
accident</EM>." Indeed, the perception of similarities and 
dissimilarities is made by some nominalists to be the very basis of all 
knowledge.</P> 

<P>(b) The state of the case is, then, that while admitting real 
similitudes and our knowledge of them, nominalists have so far ignored 
these in their account of universals as to declare, that the 
universality is only in the word, and neither in the things nor in the 
concepts.  That it is not <EM>formally</EM> in the thing we admit; that 
there is <EM>no foundation</EM> in the thing we deny, for there is the 
real likeness, affording to a mind which has the power of abstraction 
and reflexion, a <EM>groundwork</EM> for the formation of universal 
concepts.  Next we affirm that the universal formally, or as such, is 
in the concept, or in the arrangement of concepts already described, as 
respectively direct and reflex universals.  If it were not there, it 
could never be in the word; or if it were in the word, and not in the 
concept, it would never enter into knowledge.  Besides, it is absurd to 
suppose a word, as such, to be universal: for the spoken sound and the 
written character are conventional signs, and always in themselves 
singular, no matter how often repeated.  Each repetition is individual: 
only the mind can universalize a sign, and its power so to do is 
evident from our previous explanation of the process.</P> 

<P>(c) These facts are so obvious that it becomes necessary to give 
evidence that there are professed nominalists who, whatever their 
consistency, do promulgate the doctrine here refuted.  "The universal," 
says Hobbes,<sup><small><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></small></sup> "is neither something existing in nature nor an idea, 
nor a phantasm, but always a name." Berkeley<sup><small><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup> sets out from 
nominalistic principles: "As it is impossible for me to see or feel 
anything without an actual sensation of that thing, so it is impossible 
for me to conceive in my thoughts any sensible thing or object distinct 
from the sensation or perception of it." He disavows the power of 
abstraction, without which thoughts cannot be universalized: "Whether 
others have this wonderful faculty of abstracting ideas, they best can 
tell;" as for himself he can variously compound individual parts, but 
cannot rise above the individual.  Mixing up sensitive imagination, 
which of course cannot duly perform the office of abstraction, with 
thought proper, be says: "For myself I find, indeed, that I have a 
faculty of imagining, or representing to myself the ideas of those 
particular things I have perceived, and of variously compounding and 
dividing them.  I can imagine a man with two heads, or the upper parts 
of man joined to the body of a horse.  I can consider the hand, the 
eye, the nose, each by itself, abstracted or separated from the rest of 
the body.  But, then, whatever hand or eye I imagine, it must have some 
particular shape or colour.  The idea of man that I frame to myself, 
must be either of a white, or a black, or a tawny, a straight or a 
crooked, a tall or a low or a middle-sized man.  I cannot by any effort 
of thought conceive the	abstract idea of man, motion," &amp;c. All this 
talk is an utter ignoring of the power of reflective thought to pick 
out what it chooses, to fix upon a definition, and to deal with that as 
with a mentally isolated part.  Hume continues the tradition taken up 
from Berkeley, whose doctrine on universals he pronounces<sup><small><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></small></sup> "one of 
the greatest and most valuable discoveries made of late years" -- a 
discovery which he himself seeks to "put beyond all doubt." He frames 
the theory thus: "All general ideas are nothing but particular ones, 
annexed to a certain term, which gives them a more extensive 
signification, and makes them recall, upon occasion, other individuals 
which are similar to them.  A particular idea becomes general by being 
annexed to a general term, that is, a term which, from a customary 
conjunction, has a relation to many other particular ideas, and 
generally recalls them in the imagination.  Abstract ideas are, 
therefore, in themselves individual, however they may become general in 
their representation.  The image in our mind is only that of a 
particular object, though the application of it in our reasoning is the 
same as if it was universal." This is inadequate and wrong <EM>de 
more.</EM>  Mill,<sup><small><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></small></sup> of course, follows in the wake of Hume, and we 
have already heard him declare: "General concepts we have properly 
speaking none: we have only complex ideas of objects in the concrete;"
and by exclusive attention to parts of an associated whole, "we can 
carry on a meditation relating to the parts only, as if we were able to 
conceive them separately from the rest." This power of separate 
conception, so far as we approach to it, he attributes to the 
association of the separated characters with a word, instead of to the 
mind's power of abstraction, or <EM>praecisio objectiva.</EM></P> 

<P>3. (a) Conceptualists allow that the universal is in the idea, but 
deny its objective reality. They can gainsay the real likenesses 
between things no more than can the nominalists; but they do not 
perceive that herein is a <EM>foundation</EM> for all the objective 
reality which we want.  Where they improve on the nominalists is in 
admitting the possibility of a universal idea; a result which comes 
from their having a better theory of mental action.  This improvement 
is strongly to be accentuated, and shows the large step from nominalism 
to conceptualism. Mental action, according to the nominalists of this 
country, is tied down to sensations, and to mechanical or chemical 
associations of ideas.  Instead of a voluntary power of abstraction, 
they assert a "law of obliviscence," a loss to consciousness of one 
part of a complex aggregate, through an excessive attention to another 
part.  As in the matter of human will they allow only a conflict and 
final preponderance between concurring attractions or repulsions, while 
we assert an intellectual power to consider the <EM>pros</EM> and the 
<EM>cons</EM> of separate courses, and a power of free choice 
supervening: so in the matter of general ideas they ignore, while we 
and conceptualists insist upon, the spontaneous activity of the mind in 
taking up, or leaving alone, elements in an aggregate conception, 
according to the purpose in view.  Thus conceptualists are enabled to 
abstract from individualizing differences and to universalize what they 
so acquire.  In spite of their better premisses conceptualists arrive 
at a false conclusion: but it is something that they excel the 
nominalists by admitting universality in ideas, while their mistake 
seems often a mere oversight rather than a rooted error.</P> 

<P>(b) Conceptualism is wrong in that it pushes a truth too far: it 
sees that there is no formal universality <EM>a parte rei,</EM> and 
thereupon it sweepingly denies the objectivity of universal ideas.  A 
distinction is needed.  The universal ideas in what they represent are 
objectively real; but not in their abstract mode of representation, 
which, however, is not predicated of objects.  When of any individual 
it is predicated that he is a man, the predicate is, we will suppose, 
strictly applicable: but no individual is man in the abstract.  As, 
however, the individuality is not pointed out by the universal term, so 
neither, on the other hand, is the individuality denied: it is simply 
omitted.  The case is made all the clearer by the reality of the 
physical sciences.  When we are told that the best scientific 
generalizations are not real, we reply that this is going too far.  
Supposing them properly made, they are real, in the sense in which, 
against conceptualism, moderate realism is true.  Any one who has 
appropriated to himself the correct doctrine of universals, has got the 
means of exactly determining how far a legitimately generalized law is 
a real law.  The laws of motion, for instance, represent a part of the 
reality of nature, even though they be not, perhaps, three distinct 
laws, but only a threefold enunciation of results, due to one common 
principle and even though their enunciation by us be incomplete as a 
statement of the whole case.  Perhaps there is some simple law of 
action at work in nature, which law, if comprehended, would give us all 
that we know under our three laws of motion and a good deal more 
besides.  Still, as partial solutions of a complex problem, the three 
laws are really true: for they sum up experienced facts, and they do 
not necessarily involve anything not in the experience.  Even if we 
make our simple starting-points what are really not primal elements 
but resultants from compound forces, still, as we never declare our 
ultimates to be absolutely ultimate, but only ultimate for us, we keep 
on safe ground.  So some suppose that the law of attraction, as 
formulated by us, may be not elementary but a resultant; be it so, and 
it remains a real law -- a law of derivatives, if not of primitives.  A 
being who could ascertain the attraction of a large spherical planet 
only as something proceeding as if from the centre, not as really due to 
every single particle, would be right as far as he went.  In such a way 
do we maintain the reality of generalized laws in physics.  A 
scientific man, in his own interest, should be slow to clutch at a 
theory either of nominalism or of conceptualism; whereas he may be 
quite happy if he can intellectually justify to himself moderate 
realism.</P>
