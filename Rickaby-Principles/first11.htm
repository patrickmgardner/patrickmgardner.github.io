<P>THE last proposition has brought us to a point whence a look 
backwards, and another forwards, become necessary in order to clear 
away natural misgivings that we may be wandering about aimlessly. We 
have travelled together through regions of our own experience as 
knowledge-gathering creatures; we have noted down the general 
characteristics of certitude and of its allied or opposed states, but 
have avoided details.  The consequence may be that some of the company 
have felt uneasy, and would over and over again have liked to pause on 
some such questions as, how the reports of the senses are to be 
credited, or how abstract and general ideas are valid, which 
confessedly have corresponding to them no abstract and general objects.  
But steadily and inexorably the surveying party has been led on, with 
the promise that another survey shall be made to fill in details, and 
with the declaration that, meanwhile, human certitude, before our 
philosophizing about it, sufficiently attests its own validity.</P> 

<P>1. We have mapped out some of the general features of human 
knowledge, and spreading out the unfinished sketch, we observe what we 
have done.  Beginning with logical truth, that is, with the knowing of 
truth, we decided, that apart from any theory as to how the mind can 
produce a resemblance of the several objects which it knows, yet we 
cannot intelligibly admit that it really knows anything while we deny 
that the knowledge bears any likeness to the thing known. Some sort of 
likeness there must be, though after a peculiar mode which our 
imitative arts cannot copy.  Mere concomitant variation in mind and 
object will not suffice, if it is declared to carry no resemblance.</P> 

<P>Inquiring next what is the special act of mind in which logical 
truth is to be found in its fulness, we settled that it must be the 
<EM>judgement,</EM> the act by which we affirm or deny, by which we are 
conscious that something is, or is not.  Unless we go as far as this 
point, we are not yet in possession of a truth at best we are on the 
way to possession.</P> 

<P>The conscious, full, and firm possession of the truth, to the 
exclusion of doubt, is <EM>certitude,</EM> a state of mind which we 
contrasted with ignorance, and with mere tendencies to assent, or 
assents given as to probabilities only.  To distinguish these states 
belongs to the logician, though it is not his province to determine, in 
all fields of knowledge, what is the measure of assent or dissent due 
to any given statement.  As a matter of self-analysis, a man maybe 
ought to sometimes be puzzled whether or not put aside suggested 
reasons for doubt, as being quite neutralised by contrary reasons; and 
in cases of such perplexity he will often have to appeal to 
considerations more concrete than logic supplies.</P> 

<P>Returning to certitude we gave its broad distinction into 
<EM>natural</EM> and <EM>artificial, non-scientific</EM> and 
<EM>scientific, philosophic</EM> and <EM>common-sense;</EM> and we 
showed the interdependence between the two. Either branch -- but we 
have regard especially to the second -- is divisible according to its 
specific motive, into three kinds, <EM>metaphysical, physical,</EM> and 
<EM>moral.</EM>  We likewise saw in what sense a proposition, which is 
certain, may be regarded as having its certitude greater or less.</P> 

<P>In absolute opposition to certitude came scepticism under its most 
uncompromising form, or total negation of the power of mind to acquire 
real knowledge of things.  Such scepticism was shown to be quite 
indefensible as a position taken up and defended by argument; its very 
possibility was denied in view of the irresistible self-assertion of a 
reasonable nature.  However, there was a scepticism calling itself 
<EM>methodic,</EM> and professing to lead to the most legitimate 
dogmatism; but its professions proved hollow, and its failure served 
only to confirm our own previous proposition, that philosophy must 
build on natural certitude.  In the words of Mr. Spencer, the 
philosophy of certitude "can be nothing but the analysis of our 
knowledge by means of our knowledge, an inquiry by our intelligence 
into the decisions of our intelligence." We cannot carry on such an 
inquiry without taking for granted the trustworthiness of our 
intelligence.  But against any one supposing that this assumption 
itself is a blind, instinctive process, we entered our "caveat" not 
without call.</P> 

<P>Having rejected the Cartesian primary facts and principles, as 
explained by their author, we felt bound to agree upon some of our own; 
and as primary truths we assigned what were called the <EM>First 
Fact,</EM>the <EM>First Condition,</EM> the <EM>First Principle;</EM> 
to which trio the <EM>Principle of Sufficient Reason</EM> was added. 
Out of these elements we cannot hope to buildup a system as Euclid 
built up his geometry; but so far as the logic of certitude is 
reducible to a few elements, these are they.  We need hardly try to 
make all that Hamilton has made out of the Principle of Identity; 
because so far as what he says has truth in it, the truth seems scarce 
worth such explicit proclamation; or at any rate, it is very 
calculated to vex the souls of some readers.  In behalf of our own 
primaries, the defence is available, that they are evident without 
demonstration, and that no one can argue against them without 
implicitly affirming them.</P> 

<P>2. Thus far we have gone; but what is to be the next step? Many 
schoolmen follow the plan of entering here upon the consideration of 
what they call the means or the sources of knowledge.  Their work comes 
pretty much to a division and a defence of faculties which successively 
take up the elements of knowledge, and bring them out in the shape of 
formed propositions.  A justification is attempted of sensations, 
ideas, memory, judgment, and reasoning.  But without a word of 
condemnation for the method of others, we may relegate these matters to 
the Second Part; the reason being that they may fairly be regarded as 
belonging to the details of the Subject, not to that most general 
description of Certitude which forms the First Part.  As belonging to 
the latter, however, we will at once grapple with a question often 
delayed till the very end of the treatise, namely, with 
<EM>Evidence,</EM> considered as the objective criterion of truth.  
Since this is the perfectly general criterion of all certitude, we are 
justified in putting it along with the other matters which we have 
called "Generalities." There will thus be a book on Generalities and a 
book on Particularities; after which the reader will not be asked to 
extend his patient efforts to yet another book.</P>
