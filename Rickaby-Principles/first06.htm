<P>1. WE must next begin to handle the question, about our real 
possession of certitude concerning things.  All along the affirmative 
answer has been tacitly assumed, as it must be assumed by whoever 
professes to be conducting a rational discussion: but it is now time to 
talk explicitly about the subject. Philosophy, though an inevitable 
development of mental culture, belongs rather to the <EM>bene esse</EM> 
than to the <EM>esse</EM> of intellectual life.  If ever luxuries 
precede necessaries, as in the priority of metrical over prose 
literature, there is some accidental reason for this apparent inversion 
of right order.  The early Greek philosophers found verse decidedly an 
easier way of giving currency to their opinions: so that when 
Heraclitus of Ephesus made the experiment of trying to invent a prose 
style that should have scientific accuracy, he brought down upon 
himself, perhaps not solely because he wrote in prose, the epithet of 
<b>ho skoteinos</b>, "the Obscure." But before any systematic 
philosophy, which is worth the name, and is not a mere fantastic 
cosmogony or something of that sort, there must go a fair development 
of the intellect, by its working, we do not say unphilosophically, but 
non-philosophically.</P> 

<P>2. By philosophy is here meant "the knowledge of things through 
their ultimate causes."<sup><small><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></small></sup> All science agrees in being <EM>scientia 
rerum per causas,</EM> where the word "cause" is used in a wide sense, 
to signify the <EM>rationale</EM> of things: but it is special to 
philosophy to investigate the very ultimate reasons of things.  Not all 
parts of philosophy, as is plain, can be about things equally ultimate; 
but all parts are deservedly classed as ultimate investigations.</P> 

<P>3. The subject of the present treatise is undoubtedly, in its own 
order, an ultimate inquiry: for it discusses the very radical question, 
What is the validity of human knowledge? The special sciences assume 
this validity, and upon the assumption observe, analyze, synthesize, 
and methodize.  Applied Logic has to take up the previous question, 
What is the guarantee of objective validity in observation, analysis, 
synthesis, and method? Sometimes the man of special science laughs at 
the logician: but he would not laugh if he remembered that, unless 
Logic is valid, his own conclusions are of no scientific value.</P> 

<P>4. And yet the man of concrete science need not be a philosopher, 
which is not the same thing as saying philosophy need not be true; 
without philosophy he is quite right to take the validity of his 
faculties, and his way of using them, for established.  We may go some 
way with Balmez when he says in his <EM>Fundamental Philosophy:</EM> 
"If any part of science ought to be regarded as purely speculative, it 
is undoubtedly the part which concerns certainty."<sup><small><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup> For consider how 
we teach philosophy.  We let a boy go all through his school course, 
which includes various sciences, but we do not ask him to study 
philosophy strictly so called.  If he intends to take up this branch, 
we are glad of his deferring it for a few years more; and if he enters 
upon his course at the age of twenty-one, we are rather satisfied than 
sorry at the delay, because he brings to his task a maturity of years, 
which is usually indispensable for real philosophizing, as 
distinguished from learning systems by rote, or from learning how to 
manipulate stock phrases.</P> 

<P>Here, then, we show our firm belief that stores of real knowledge, 
and even of scientific knowledge, may be gathered by the mind that has 
never turned introspectively upon itself to systematize its own laws.  
What we call natural knowledge we hold as quite valid: the mind 
observes, reasons, and reflects, and in the exercise of these faculties 
perceives its own powers, and is convinced that it acts rightly.  At 
the same time there spontaneously occur these self-questionings, which, 
when systematized and answered, form a body of philosophic 
doctrine.</P> 

<P>5. Philosophic logic, therefore, is natural knowledge rendering 
reflexly to itself an account of itself. Wonderful and most necessary 
to true intelligence is that power, whereby the mind can make its own 
thoughts the object of further thought: and herein lies one of the 
manifest discriminations of man from lower animals, and one of the 
proofs for the spirituality of the soul.  We have not two intellects, 
the one ordinary, the other extraordinary; the one direct, the other 
reflex; but we have a single intellect to think, and to analyze 
thought, to do our common-sense thinking and our philosophical 
thinking.</P> 

<P>6. Whence follows a golden rule -- distrust that philosophy which is 
at utter variance with common-sense.  What Mr. Bain says apologetically 
for idealism, forms really the strongest presumption against it, 
namely, that language, as we now have it, is based on the contrary 
hypothesis, and so will not, serve the purposes of the idealist.  
Mill,<sup><small><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup> too, is uttering his own condemnation, when he pleads 
unfairness in language; and says that if his theory of mind appears 
more incomprehensible than its rival, the reason is "because the whole 
of human language is accommodated to the latter, and is so incongruous 
with the former, that it cannot be expressed in any terms which do not 
deny its truth." It was one of Ferrier's pet declarations that 
"philosophy exists for the purpose of correcting, not for the purpose 
of confirming, the deliverance of ordinary thinking." If he had meant 
no, more than that philosophy, like any other science, should correct 
some popular delusions, there would have been nothing against which to 
object; but he meant a substantial correction of ordinary thinking, and 
that he was wrong, his own untenable idealism is sufficient token.  
Hegel, too, was wrong, as his, system again proves, when he asserted 
that "the mystics alone are fit for philosophizing." In another 
direction M. Ribot goes astray in his remark that philosophy has the 
value of mental gymnastics, exercising the faculties upon problems 
hopelessly beyond their grasp, and for that very reason calling forth 
the utmost efforts of the mind: just as a man might jump at a stretched 
string which he had no prospect of ever reaching, even with head or 
hands. Rather we should hold that, as the perfect Greek athlete was a 
man with flesh-and-blood muscles, trained to the utmost, but still of 
flesh-and-blood so the perfect philosopher is a common-sense man, who 
has bestowed uncommon care on the scientific examination of his common 
sense, but only by the aid of that which he has been examining.  A 
philosophy written from this stand-point will read as if written in the 
open air, not in some sickly closet, where body and mind have their 
natural health destroyed.</P> 

<P>On the principle here maintained, philosophy must never do anything 
that is dead against natural reason, as, for instance, give it the lie 
direct, or doubt its evident convictions.  More will be said of 
Descartes hereafter, but he is too apt an illustration not to be used 
at present.  He professed to be able "seriously and for good reasons" 
to doubt such self-evident truths as the capability of his own 
faculties to acquire knowledge and the plainest axioms in mathematics.  
Now this was sawing off the branch on which he sat, and it brought him 
to the ground, shattered beyond the possibility of rising again.  It 
was philosophic suicide.  Even Hume noticed that "the Cartesian doubt, 
were it ever possible, as it plainly is not, would be entirely 
incurable; and no reasoning could ever bring us to a state of assurance 
on any subject." Aware that it cannot create an intellect of its own, 
or discover an intellect that has not first spontaneously manifested 
itself, the scholastic philosophy accepts the position and makes the 
best of it, which best is not bad.  It does not aim at a new kind of 
knowledge, a Soufi ecstasy or Hegelian dialectic, but only at elevating 
the vulgar knowledge, extending its range, and especially training it, 
by the aid of its own lights, to see its own highest principles of 
activity.</P> 

<P>Hence the theory of knowledge, as proposed by the scholastics, 
whatever may be said of some details, at least in its essential parts 
has nothing that makes a heavy demand on the credence of the ordinary 
mind -- such a demand, for instance, as is made by our pure 
empiricists, and our so-called Neo-Kantians, who scarce have the first 
requisite of intelligibility, and who, so far as they are intelligible, 
are often extravagant.  Indeed, the scholastic account so falls in with 
the view of the ordinary thinker, that the latter, when he takes up our 
treatises, is apt to exclaim: Is this what you call philosophy? Why, it 
seems to me that it needs no philosopher to point out that intelligence 
is intelligent; that what is evident is true; that the final test of 
understanding is, on one side, the actual experience of being able to 
understand; and to utter other such plain propositions into which I can 
resolve your rather more elevated utterances.  There is truth in these 
remarks, and a truth not to be disguised, nor shamefacedly admitted, 
but manfully recognized.  Our philosophy does start from common sense, 
and can never shake itself free from its humble beginnings.  It is a 
<EM>terrae filius</EM> by origin; but at least it is the offspring of a 
healthy soil; and now that it has dressed itself up and made the best 
of itself, it presents no ignoble appearance.  Neither was its parent, 
natural knowledge, mere blind instinct; it had the same means at 
command as philosophy has, but its skill in the use of them was 
somewhat inferior: though it saw its way as it went, it had not the 
cleverness actually to draw a map of the course.  Now it can not only 
make journeys, but write an account of them, and gives sketches by the 
way.</P> 

<P>7. The nature of philosophy being thus explained, it is clear that 
we can never find what some seem to insist upon, and what Ferrier tried 
to give in his <EM>Institutes of Metaphysics</EM>, namely, a philosophy 
of certitude built up after the plan of Euclid's geometry. Euclid 
begins with axioms, postulates, and definitions, and then he so piles 
proposition on proposition as never to need the conclusion of a later 
proposition as part of his proof of an earlier.  But Euclid assumed 
those truths, which the philosophy of certitude has to discuss: what he 
had to prove lay all within the narrow department of quantity in 
extension, as represented by lines and angles.  On the other hand, he 
who draws out the philosophy of certitude has to discuss the very 
faculties and principles which he must be using all the time, and 
cannot proceed a step without tacitly assuming the conclusions of 
pretty nearly his whole treatise.</P> 

<P>Write any first chapter you like to your Book on Certitude, and see 
how far it is from involving only one simple idea or principle: see how 
much it already implies, upon which you will have afterwards to raise 
questions.  You are going in general to ask if man can have real 
knowledge: and how can you help supposing all the time that he can? 
Relying on the veracity of the senses, in spite of its being so hotly 
canvassed a point, you refer to the writings of other authors, and in 
return you have recourse to the printed characters, which are to convey 
your thoughts to the world.</P> 

<P>The reader, therefore, must be patient, and wait till he arrives at 
the end of the book, before setting, in his own mind, that the author 
leaves necessary matters undiscussed ; and he must not expect a 
Euclidean inverted pyramid -- a system rising, as it were, from a point 
and broadening as it ascends -- to be erected where that style of 
structure is neither needful nor possible.  He must not too readily 
take it for granted that there is illegitimate arguing in a circle, if 
he is referred about from chapter to chapter, or told to put off, till 
a subsequent chapter be reached, his search for various pieces of 
information.  If it is better to refrain from plainly saying that many 
of our propositions cannot strictly be proved, it is not because this 
declaration would not contain a truth; indeed, it is eminently true; 
but because it is pretty sure, in nine cases out of ten, to be taken in 
the very false sense, that no satisfactory account can ultimately be 
given of the judgments we hold by, and that we can take our so-called 
knowledge only on blind trust.  From such a view we must strongly 
dissent; and if some propositions in this treatise are called not 
strictly demonstrable, the meaning is that they are immediately 
evident, and do not admit of resolution into simpler propositions.</P> 

<P>8. What has been said of the <EM>Allzusammenheit,</EM> 
"altogetherness," or interfusion of parts, in the philosophy of 
certitude, which forbids the orderly march of propositions that we see 
in Euclid, may be paralleled by the impossibility of putting the 
several sciences into exact hierarchical order. One objection which Mr. 
Spencer urges against Comte's classification, namely, that some of the 
earlier sciences have to wait for advances to be made in the later, 
will always remain, whatever be the arrangement in way of 
subordination: and a quite perfect gradation is impossible.  This is a 
fact, but it need create no great discomfort.</P> 

<P>9. After having explained some wrong and some right conceptions as 
to the nature of philosophy, and having in mind the sad extravagances 
which the history of philosophy reveals in far too large a proportion 
of its parts, we may now draw a practical conclusion as to the sane 
method of philosophizing.  We observe that the strain after the very 
knowledge of knowledge and wisdom of wisdom, has led to the neglect of 
the Apostolic precept, "Not to be wiser than it behoves us to be wise, 
but to think soberly."<sup><small><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></small></sup> Hence are suggested golden mottoes like these 
"Moderation is the best";<sup><small><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></small></sup> "Be not wise beyond thy wits"; "Be not 
wise after the manner of the wiseacre"; " Philosophize not unto 
foolishness"; "Do not for the sake of philosophizing destroy the 
foundations of philosophy."<sup><small><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></small></sup> These and the like maxims the 
philosopher should keep in his mind as ballast, or else the mental 
balloon may quickly be found outside the element wherein man can 
breathe.  With regard to how many a writer, Hegel, say, or Hartmann, or 
one of the old Gnostic evolvers of Eons, have we sorrowfully to 
exclaim: " Alas, poor man, he has taken the headlong plunge into the 
great inane: it is hopeless trying to follow him, and he himself will 
never re-emerge!" The greater his powers, the more desperate, perhaps, 
is his condition; for, as St. Augustine observes, <EM>Magna magnorum 
deliramenta doctorum;</EM> or, as Balmez puts it, "There are errors 
which lie out of the reach of an ordinary mind "words which for present 
purposes it may be allowable to understand so that they form a 
repetition of the <EM>dictum</EM> of St. Augustine.  One thing this 
volume does promise the reader, that in it he shall never be asked to 
believe what to the plain Christian man is startling, or appeals to no 
intelligent principle within him.  It has no propositions brought down 
from the region of the marvellous.  Mr. M. Arnold has lately told us, 
that there has at length dawned in England a day for which, years ago, 
he could only hope; and that now it <EM>is</EM> here regarded as an 
objection to a thing that it is absurd.  If ever such a day dawns for 
philosophy, how will its light dissolve the hazy reputation of many a 
once cherished philosopher!</P>
