<P>1. The outfit as to bodily means, with which some begin a University 
career, has excited partly the amusement and partly the compassion of 
those who have heard such stories as are typified, on one side by the 
youth with the "great coat and the pair of pistols;" and on the other 
side by some of the poorer students of Glasgow and Edinburgh, who all 
too grimly appreciate Sydney Smith's joke: "We tune our song on 
slender oats."<A HREF="#N_1_"><sup><small>{1}</small></sup></A> Still some manage to 
feed  fat the mind, while the flesh remains lean, especially if they 
start with a good mental outfit: for that is the immediately important 
thing in the freshman.  The philosopher's stock-in-trade at starting, 
after the clearing out of his premises, has been reduced by Descartes 
to what we have seen to be ruinous conditions: and therefore we 
naturally ask ourselves with what supplies we undertake to make a 
commencement.  Already we have settled to keep our natural knowledge, 
not in the extravagant trust that all our judgments have been correct, 
but with a general assurance that we have fairly trained minds, and 
have laid in a store of certitudes, the ultimate foundation of which we 
may proceed to examine at leisure, without the slightest fear of 
bringing about a total collapse.  We did not begin systematically to 
philosophize during our school life, because we were not ripe for the 
exercise; but we began in early manhood, when at least we might hope 
that we were moderately prepared for the work.  We should have held it 
preposterous had we been called upon, at the inaugural lecture of our 
philosophic course, to recite, instead of a <EM>Credo a Dubito,</EM> 
after the style of the Cartesian formula: I doubt all the truths which 
hitherto I have held most certain; I question the reality of my body, 
and the reports of all my senses; I doubt the competency even of my 
mental powers, and by means of this doubt do I expect salvation.</P> 

<P>2. Not, however, to rest content with declaring a general trust in 
the results of our previous life, subject to many such accidental 
corrections as a more critical study of details shall suggest, we must 
pick out a few primary truths, as of universal prevalence throughout 
every act of knowledge.  It has before been declared that we cannot 
give, in perfect order, first a single principle, then another, and 
then another, and lay it down, that this is the progress, step by step, 
of every human mind.  Much has been said, both in prose and in verse, 
about the first waking up of the child to conscious life, and 
especially to the distinction of self and not self.  One sage regards 
the latter crisis as very solemn, and tells how the infant mind, seeing 
itself opposed to a whole universe, with a strong cry proclaims its 
right to assert its own individuality, and to live.  Ferrier<A 
HREF="#N_2_"><sup><small>{2}</small></sup></A> describes the moment as one of 
transition from the "feral" to the "human" state.  Other authors have 
carefully chronicled the indications of dawning intelligence in young 
children, and the study of new-born animals has not been neglected.  
Richter fancied that he remembered the time and the circumstances, in 
which the thought first flashed upon him, "I am I;" and he gives a 
detailed account of the grand revelation.</P> 

<P>But these are matters we may leave to other inquirers.  Probably 
anything like the clear, steady possession of one definite certitude 
does not come till after the mind has acquired many floating ideas, 
which appear and disappear fluctuatingly on the surface of 
consciousness, and after many judgments of similarly fluctuating 
character.  That the child's first thoughts are fixed, clear-cut, and 
coherent judgments, is more than we can believe.</P> 

<P>Much as we dissent from the whole theory upon the origin and the 
nature of knowledge, as propounded by Mr. Spencer,<A 
HREF="#N_3_"><sup><small>{3}</small></sup></A> we may take some useful hints from a 
passage like the following: "Every thought involves a whole system of 
thoughts, and ceases to exist if severed from its various correlatives.  
As we cannot isolate a single organ of a living body, and deal with it 
as though it had a life independent of the rest; so, from the organized 
structure of our cognitions, we cannot cut one, and proceed as though 
it had survived the separation.  Overlooking this all-important truth, 
however, speculators have habitually set out with some professedly 
simple datum or data; have supposed themselves to assume nothing beyond 
this datum or these data; and have thereupon proceeded to prove or 
disprove propositions which were, by implication, already unconsciously 
asserted along with that which was consciously asserted." Our own 
application of the doctrine will appear in what we are now to 
explain.</P> 

<P>Probably it is our common experience, that we cannot, by memory, 
recall how knowledge first sprang up in the mind, but we can do 
something suggestive on the subject.  We can actually remember how, 
upon our beginning some new study, the terms and principles one moment 
seemed to show a gleam of light, and then were suddenly dark again; 
then once more the flame flickered up, till gradually a few strong 
lights were fixed, around which we could range others.</P> 

<P>And if this was the case in later years, yet more strongly would the 
like features be marked, when our intelligence was first feeling its 
way to the exercise of its own powers.  The child's mind is full of 
abortive ideas, incoherences, and fantastic combinations; so that 
nurses, in talking to children, by a sort of instinctive sympathy, talk 
nonsense, while nonsense verses form the child's earliest literature.  
Some of our recollections of childhood are probably of grotesque, 
impossible events, which yet we should simply say that we remembered, 
were it not that we now perceive such incidents to be absurd as 
realities; they are incidents like those of the nursery rhymes, one 
writer of which Mr. Lear, has had positively to defend himself against 
symbol-scenting interpreters, by the declaration, "nonsense plain and 
absolute has been my aim throughout."</P> 

<P>So far, however, as we did form any judgment, we must have been in 
practical possession of certain great general principles, though we 
could not single out the abstract elements from their concrete 
embodiments and universalize them.  Now at length we are called upon to 
evolve what must have been involved in our earliest cognitions, 
whatever may have been their concrete matter; nor must we overlook the 
difficulties in the way of our analysis.  We have to abstract first 
principles, not out of our first thoughts, which are equivalently lost 
to us, but out of our adult thoughts, which are often so complicated 
that a single sentence may suppose an acquaintance with a vast subject-
matter.  Without falling into the exaggerated doctrine of relativity, 
we must allow those facts of which it is the perverted account, for 
instance, that all knowledge is closely interrelated. Reverting to the 
passage just now quoted from Mr. Spencer, we must allow the almost 
illimitable blending of idea with idea, in the texture of mind: indeed 
the body of our knowledge is a sort of organism, the property of which 
is, that the parts exist for the whole, and the whole for the parts.  
It will be a test that we are able sufficiently to isolate by reflexion 
a few primary truths, which can be absent from no act of knowledge.  We 
insist much on this power of reflective abstraction, and by its means 
we are going to work.  A primary fact, a primary condition, and a 
primary principle -- these are what we are about to single out.</P> 

<P>(a) The fact of his own existence is given implicitly, in every act 
of genuine knowledge which a man elicits.  For knowledge is of no avail 
unless it comes home to the subject as his own; or, according to one 
phraseology, perception is useless without apperception, whereby the 
object known is, for each one, brought under the form, " I 
know."<EM>Ego Cogito,</EM> not <EM>Est Cogitatio,</EM> is what 
Descartes rightly regards as an important recognition, made by every 
human mind when it comes to the proper use of its powers.</P> 

<P>An ordinary man would hardly raise any difficulty against what has 
just been asserted, unless he laboured under some delusion as to the 
extent of the assertion; fancying, for instance, that it required a 
clear, explicit thought about self, or a cognition of self which should 
amount to a definitionality or of selfhood.  To guard against such 
misconceptions, be it understood that the recognition of self need be 
only implicit, and need be no more scientific than what comes within 
the competency of the newly dawned reason of the child.  But here 
precisely we are taken up.  Does not a child show that it has no 
perception of self, by speaking of itself as "baby," "Georgie," 
"Maggie," in the third person? This fact proves nothing, for it is 
natural enough that a child should call itself by that name by which it 
hears others call it, instead of at once seizing upon the use of the 
first personal pronoun.  Also there is no difficulty in allowing that 
self-consciousness is not as strong in the child as in the adult: and 
hence the simplicity and candour of children.  The assertion of this 
characteristic is nol invalidated by the counter-assertion, that there 
is to be met with in children the unpleasing trait of great 
selfishness, imperiousness, vanity, jealousy of rivals, which 
manifestations cannot all be shown to proceed from a sort of 
mere animal instinct, devoid of all intelligent perception.</P> 

<P>If next we consider the opposition that is likely to be made against 
our <EM>First Fact</EM> from the part of philosophic theory, then the 
antagonism is greater than what was offered by the ordinary thinker.  
Still in the presence of a plain testimony of experience we have a 
right to disregard the mere exigence of a philosopher's system, which 
otherwise we know to be wrong.  It is enough therefore to mention, 
without taking the view of Mr. Spencer.<sup><small><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></small></sup> Driven by his theory to hold 
that subject can never be object, and that reflexion is never made upon 
a present state of mind but always on a past, lie says that though we 
have a "certainty" of self, we cannot have a "knowledge of self." "The 
personality of which each one is conscious, and of which the existence 
is to each a fact beyond all others the <EM>most certain,</EM> is yet a 
thing which cannot be truly <EM>known</EM> at all, knowledge of it 
being forbidden by the very nature of thought." It is far better to 
assert simply, on the strength of evident experience, that we know 
self, than thus recur to a distinction, which supposes "a fact most 
certain" not to come under "knowledge," but only under some obscurer 
form of consciousness.  If such consciousness does not amount to 
knowledge, it can be only a sort of blind belief; a consequence we may 
deduce from many other parts of Mr. Spencer's philosophy.  In reliance 
on his principle<sup><small><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></small></sup> that "the invariable persistence of a belief is our 
sole warrant for any truth of immediate consciousness and of 
demonstration," he makes the unsatisfactory announcement, that "in the 
proposition, <EM>I am,</EM> he who utters it cannot find any proof but 
the invariable persistence of the belief in it." It is far simpler and 
truer to say, that to each sane man his own existence is self-evident, 
and admits of no strict proof; his constant belief in it not being so 
much a proof, as something which requires no justification by proof, 
because the thing is self-evident, and therefore above proof strictly 
so called.</P> 

<P>(b) Descartes, with us so far, now abandons us, declaring that he 
can and does doubt the validity of his very faculties; and that in 
consequence hey is driven to set about a scientific verification of his 
mental powers.  We maintain that our ability to know cannot be to is 
matter of strict demonstration, of inference from premisses more 
evident, but must be taken as the <EM>First Condition.</EM> This is no 
assumption, in the bad sense of the phrase; for we are made immediately 
conscious of our power to know, in the very exercise of our faculties.  
Nor could we learn the fact any other way, as, for example, by the 
testimony of others.  If a rational being uses his reason, the result 
is that he finds out what manner of being he is; a thing that the 
irrational being never does, especially if it be also insensate, like a 
plant or a stone.  As Cardinal Newman puts it, we trust first of all, 
not our faculties, but their acts, or our faculties in act.  And Dr. 
M'Cosh, in his <EM>Intuitions of the Mind,</EM> says: "We do not found 
knowledge, as the Scotch metaphysicians seem to do, on belief in our 
nature and constitution.  It would be as near the truth to say, that 
we believe our constitution because it makes known realities.  But the 
truth is that the two seem involved one in the other.  In our 
cognitions and feelings, we know and believe in objects, and in doing 
so we trust in our constitution."</P> 

<P>One little allowance, however, may be made to those who teach that 
we <EM>prove</EM> our ability to know, though, it is to be feared, they 
will not be satisfied with the concession.  We must remember here what 
we stated in our last chapter, how a man waking slowly from a vivid 
dream, may gradually explore his own state and so convince himself by 
degrees that he is in his right mind.  But such a case lends no support 
to the adversaries of what here is being assumed as the First Condition 
of all knowledge, a condition the fulfilment of which is tacitly 
recognised in every intelligent act that we perform.  "Knowledge is 
power," and feels itself to be such intrinsically: it feels that it is 
a power to know.</P> 

<P>(c) Within the thinking subject we have now got a <EM>First 
Fact,</EM> the recognition by the subject of self; and a <EM>First 
Condition,</EM> the subject's power to know, also recognised as a fact; 
we must next add <EM>a First Principle</EM> on the objective side, 
namely, the <EM>Principle of Contradiction.</EM>  To show the 
objectivity of this principle we formulate it, not on the logical, but 
on the ontological side.  We do not simply say, "the same thing cannot, 
in the same sense, be affirmed and denied," but "the same thing cannot, 
in the same way, be and not be." Under both aspects the principle is 
self-evident, and it is only the extreme of irrationality in Mill, 
which makes him refrain from asserting its absoluteness both for all 
thought and for all things.  Yet even he ventures so far as to 
write,<sup><small><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></small></sup> "that the same thing should at once be and not be; that 
identically the same statement should be both true and false, is not 
only inconceivable to us, but we cannot conceive that it should be made 
conceivable." He admits too, that if there are any primitive 
necessities of thought, this is one of them.  With him Mr. Bain agrees 
to the extent of affirming that, "were it admissible that a thing could 
be and not be, our faculties would be stultified and rendered 
nugatory." Hampered by no theories from Hume, we simply assert. as 
self-evident to reason, the Principle of Contradiction, or as Hamilton 
prefers to call it, the Principle of Non-contradiction.  No statement 
that we could make would have any meaning, if this principle had not 
clear objective validity.</P> 

<P>3. The above three are called <EM>primaries,</EM> but not in the 
exclusive sense.  Such a phrase as the "three first" is often 
criticized, and by some declared to be quite inadmissible.  If it 
stands for objects which are respectively first, second, and third in a 
series, we may leave it undiscussed; but when it stands for three which 
are abreast in forming the first rank, then we are here concerned to 
defend the expression, so far as to justify our assertion of "three 
primaries." The word "first," like any superlative, may qualify simply 
an individual, or it may qualify a whole class, and be predicated of 
the individuals in that class. Thus we can use it when we say, "the ten 
first men in England" each of the ten holds independently a first 
place.  When, therefore, we are speaking of the three primaries, we are 
not putting one before the other, nor even denying that there are other 
primaries: it is sufficient that the three are primaries, and further, 
that among primaries, they deserve a special prominence to be given to 
them, because of their importance.  But, in addition to them, the 
principle of identity is primary, so is the principle of sufficient 
reason, that nothing can be without an adequate account for its 
existence; and so is the principle of evidence, that what is evident 
must be accepted as true.  To compile a catalogue of all the truths 
which are self-evident, and cannot be reduced to components simpler 
than themselves, would be a tedious work, and not helpful to present 
purposes.  If, however, we are called upon to emphasize any beyond the 
three mentioned primaries, it will be the Principle of Sufficient 
Reason, so often violated by pure empiricists, and yet so vital to all 
philosophy.  When Mr. Bain declares that there is no repugnancy in "an 
isolated event," or "in something arising out of nothing," if we are to 
take him literally, he puts himself out of the pale of reasoning 
creatures.  His friend Mill is nearer to the sane principle, at least 
as far as a single sentence goes, when he writes: That any given effect 
is only necessary provided that the causes tending to produce it are 
not controlled; that whatever happens could not have happened 
otherwise, unless something had taken place, which was capable of 
preventing it, no one needs surely to hesitate to admit." Unfortunately 
when he says, "cause," Mill does not mean "cause," but otherwise his 
words are in the right direction; and we at any rate do well to put in 
the position of a primary truth, the principle of Sufficient 
Reason.</P> 

<P>We must dissent, however, from the peculiar treatment of this 
principle by Mansel, who first of all states it only in its logical 
side, "Every judgment must have a sufficient ground for its assertion," 
and then denies it to be a principle. "The only reason for a thought of 
any kind is its relation to some other thought, and this relation will 
in each case be determined by its own proper law. The principle of 
sufficient reason is, therefore, no law of thought, but only the 
statement that every act of thought must be governed by some law or 
other."<sup><small><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></small></sup> He even ventures something like a possible suspicion of the 
principle, but does not clearly assert it: "If considerations 
[concerning free-will] suggest a limit to the universality of the 
principle of sufficient reason, so be it."<sup><small><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>ADDENDA.</P>

<P>(1) Mill<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> declares "there is no ground for believing that the 
<EM>Ego</EM> is an original presentation of consciousness." When it 
does become such we have the following account of it: "The fact of 
recognizing a sensation, of remembering that it has been felt before, 
is the simplest and most elementary fact of memory; and the 
inexplicable tie, or law, or organic union, which connects the present 
consciousness with the past one, of which it reminds me, is as near, I 
think, as we can get to a positive conception of self. That there is 
something real in this tie, real as the sensations themselves, and not 
a mere product of the laws of thought, without any fact corresponding 
to it, I hold to be indubitable. . . . Whether we are directly 
conscious of it in the act of remembrance, as we are conscious in fact 
of having successive sensations, or whether according to the opinion of 
Kant we are not conscious of self at all, but are compelled to assume 
it as a necessary condition of memory, I do not undertake to decide.  
But this original element which has no community of nature with any of 
the things answering to our names and to which we cannot give any name 
but its own peculiar one, without implying some false or ungrounded 
theory, is the <EM>Ego</EM> or Self.  As such I ascribe a reality to 
the <EM>Ego</EM> -- to my own mind -- different from that real 
existence as a Permanent Possibility, which is the only reality I 
acknowledge in matter."</P> 

<P>(2) There have been authors, whose connexions may be traced back at 
least as far as Heraclitus, and who, under the idea of "becoming," as 
distinguished from "being," try to do away with the asserted 
contradiction between simultaneous being and not being.  Ferrier<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup> 
explains Heraclitus thus: "When he says that all things are in a 
continual state of flux, that a thing agrees with itself and yet 
differs from itself; when he says that strife is the father of all 
things, that everything is its own opposite and both is and is not, he 
means that things are continually changing, or that the whole system of 
the universe is a never-ceasing process of 'becoming.'" "The principal 
feature in the conception of 'being' is rest, fixedness.  Now the 
opposite of this is the principal feature in the conception of 
'becoming.' It is unrest, unfixedness.  A thing never rests at all in 
any of the changing states into which it is thrown. It is in that state 
and out of it in a shorter time than any calculus can measure."</P> 

<P>The fallacy often used to illustrate this theory, is to suppose that 
mere unextended points of time and space are, not merely limits, or 
ideal boundaries marking divisions of time and space, but are their 
actually constituent elements; so that extension is made up of an 
infinite row of inextensibles placed side by side.  This notion is 
absurd, and is not held even in what is known as the dynamistic theory 
of matter, which asserts at least extended areas of force, the centres 
only of which are unextended points.  But observing the fallacy, let us 
see how it is worked.  A body, moving continuously, is supposed at once 
to arrive at any given point, and to leave it at the same moment, and 
thus to be at once there and not there.  The sophism lies in making the 
point to be at once part of the line and not part of its extension.  If 
we keep to definitions, a point of time is of no duration, and a point 
of space of no extent.  When, then, we say that a body moves over a 
point of space in a point of time, we are uttering the very true 
statement, that in no time no space is traversed.  It being clear, 
therefore, that to account for the traversing of a literal point in a 
body's path is to account for no part of the path at all; it is 
equally clear that if any part is to be accounted for, then we must 
take at least some small extent both of space and of time.  But as soon 
as extension is considered, the whole argument fails: it can no longer 
be pretended, that the body together is and is not at one place.</P> 

<P>A somewhat like fallacy is used in reference to circular motion, 
which may be considered to be composed of a projection in a straight 
direction and a constant attraction by a definite law to the centre. 
The result is that the body never gets either nearer to the centre or 
further from it, the curvilinear path is the compromise between the two 
motions, but it is never one component alone.  Here steps in the 
fallacy-framer, and pretends that the motion is both tangential, away 
from the centre, and centripetal, or towards the point of attraction.  
We answer firmly, there is no such union of contradictories, there is 
only a movement of revolution, which is never for a moment either 
centrifugal or centripetal.</P> 

<P>(3) Mill's empirical account of the induction by which we reach the 
principle of contradiction, is thus given: "The principle of 
Contradiction should put off the ambitious phraseology which gives it 
the air of a fundamental antithesis pervading nature, and should be 
enunciated in the simpler form, that the same proposition cannot at the 
same time be false and true.  But I can go no further with the 
Nominalists, for I cannot look upon this last as a merely verbal 
proposition.  I consider it to be, like other axioms, one of our first 
and most familiar generalizations from experience.  The original 
foundation of it I take to be, that Belief and Disbelief are two 
different mental states, excluding one another.  This we know by the 
simplest observation of our own minds.  And, if we carry our 
observation outwards, we also find that light and darkness, sound and 
silence, motion and quiescence, equality and inequality, preceding and 
following, succession and simultaneousness, any positive phenomenon 
whatever and its negative, are distinct phenomena, pointedly 
contrasted.  I consider the maxim in question to be a generalization 
from all these facts."<sup><small><a href="#n_c">{c}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>(4) There is a limit to human patience in bearing with subtleties, 
which have for their object the overturning of such fundamental 
principles as that of contradiction; and in illustration of the way in 
which exhausted patience rebels, a few examples may be borrowed from 
Janet's little book on <EM>Materialism.</EM></P> 

<P>Hegel's dialectic process, which goes on the theory of reconciling 
contradictories by successive steps of antithesis and synthesis, was 
allowed a certain degree of triumph; but it also called forth violent 
denunciations from its opponents, and led to wide divergencies between 
its friends.  Schopenhauer expressed a common feeling when he called 
such philosophy" a minimum of thought, diluted into five hundred pages 
of nauseous phraseology." Humbolt, accustomed to the more sober 
physical sciences, turned to ridicule what he called "the dialectic 
tricks" of Hegel; while Goethe avowed that, "if the transcendentalists 
ever became aware of it, they would find themselves to be very 
absurd."</P> 

<P>As a reaction against so much idea-weaving, and so much building up 
in the clouds, there arose the gross materialism of Moleschott, 
B&uuml;chner, and Vogt.  The second of this trio pronounced the pretended 
philosophy to be "verbiage," "jargon," "metaphysical quackery," "a 
cooking up of old vegetables under new names," and a proceeding "which 
inspires legitimate disgust in learned and unlearned alike."</P> 

<P>(5) Hardly as a serious objection to the principle of contradiction, 
and yet as furnishing a straw at which a desperate opponent might 
clutch, but still more as having an interest of its own, the fact may 
be mentioned, that of late years lists have been compiled of words from 
out-of-the-way languages, which have a double signification, namely, an 
idea and its opposite.  We are not quite without examples of the kind 
in more familiar tongues.  The case illustrates, so far as the saying 
is true, the old <EM>dictum</EM> that "the knowledge of opposites is 
one." Another observed fact of an analogous order is that people 
recovering from amnesia, or loss of memory, are found using, instead of 
the right word for a conception, just its opposite.  To these or any 
other similar discoveries the friends of the Hegelian identification of 
contradictories are welcome; but their cause will remain hopeless as 
ever.</P> 

<P>(6) At the root of much difficulty made against the isolation of 
primary, absolute principles, stands the theory of Relativity in all 
knowledge, on the strength of which the notion of absolute being is 
denied to us; and all that is refused us under the title of knowledge, 
"at last is given back to us under the name of an inferior mode of 
consciousness.  A sentence omitted in a quotation lately made from Mr. 
Spencer, shall here be supplied:<sup><small><a href="#n_d">{d}</a></small></sup> "The development of formless 
protoplasm into an embryo, is a specialisation of parts, the 
distinctness of which increases only as fast as their combination 
increases -- each becomes a distinguishable organ, only on condition 
that it is bound up with others, which have simultaneously become 
distinguishable organs: and similarly, <EM>from the unformed material 
of consciousness,</EM> a developed intelligence can arise only by a 
process which, in making things definite, also makes them mutually 
dependent -- establishes among them certain vital connexions, the 
destruction of which causes instant death of the thoughts." Now if we 
refer back a little, we shall learn something about what this "unformed 
material of consciousness" is supposed to be.<sup><small><a href="#n_e">{e}</a></small></sup> "We come face to face 
with the ultimate difficulty -- how can there possibly be constituted a 
consciousness of the unformed and unlimited, when by its very nature 
consciousness is possible only under forms and limits? In each 
consciousness there is an element which persists.  It is alike 
impossible for this element to be absent from consciousness, and for it 
to be present in consciousness alone; either alternative involves 
unconsciousness -- the one from want of substance, the other from want 
of form.  But the persistence of this element under successive 
conditions, <EM>necessitates</EM> a sense of it as distinguished from 
the conditions.  The sense of this something, conditioned in every 
thought, is constituted by combining successive concepts deprived of 
their limits and conditions.  The indefinite concept is not the 
abstract of any one group of ideas, but of all ideas, namely, 
EXISTENCE, which is an indefinite consciousness of some. thing constant 
under all modes.  Our consciousness of the unconditioned being 
literally the unconditioned consciousness, or <EM>raw material</EM> of 
thought to which in thinking we give definite forms, it follows that an 
ever present sense of real existence is the very basis of our 
intelligence.  At the same time that by the laws of thought we are 
rigorously prevented from forming a conception of absolute existence, 
we are by the laws of thought equally prevented from ridding ourselves 
of the <EM>consciousness</EM> of absolute existence; this consciousness 
being the obverse of our own self-consciousness.  And since the only 
possible measure of relative validity among our beliefs, is the degree 
of their persistence in opposition to the efforts made to change them; 
it follows that this which persists at all times, under all 
circumstances, has the highest validity of any." In brief, our highest 
<EM>belief</EM> is about a matter we cannot <EM>know;</EM> but about 
which we have an <EM>indefinite</EM> consciousness.</P>
