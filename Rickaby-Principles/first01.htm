<P>1.	Truth is commonly divided into truth of things, truth of thought 
about things, and truth in the outward expression of our thought about 
things.  The first kind of truth is called ontological, the third 
moral, and each of these is discussed in separate volumes of the 
present series.  It is with the second member of this division, about 
what is often styled logical truth, that the treatise which we are here 
beginning is concerned.  What true knowledge is, and how its possession 
by the human intellect can be vindicated, these are the questions 
specially calling for our investigation.</P> 

<P>2.	(a) An ordinary man, if asked to explain what true knowledge is, 
would reply simply, that knowledge was true when the thing was really 
such as we thought it to be.  He would thus agree with the definition 
of the schoolmen, "Truth is an equation or a conformity of thought to 
thing." <A HREF="#N_1_"><sup><small>{1}</small></sup></A></P> 

<P>(b)  But a matter which, at first sight, seems thus readily settled, 
presents, on reflexion, a number of difficulties, which some have 
regarded as so serious as to upset the plain man's view, backed though 
it be, by other philosophies, and by the massive volumes of scholastic 
philosophy which the centuries have piled one on the top of another.  
For when the case is more narrowly sifted, are we not driven to make 
some awkward inquiries: How can mental images be like outer objects, 
especially material objects?  How are sensations like the external 
bodies which stimulate them?  When several senses give their reports of 
one object, as there is no likeness between the several reports, say 
between the taste of an orange and its colour, how can they be all like 
the object?  What is the conclusion from the notorious fact that in 
different persons, and even in the same person at different times, any 
one of the five senses may bear divergent testimonies? Besides, even if 
our knowledge were like what we call its object, to observe this 
correspondence must be an act of comparison, which not we, but some one 
else, must make: for we at least cannot compare the thing as known to 
us, with the thing as out of our knowledge.  Such an attempt on our 
part would be preposterous, a fraudulent endeavour to assert, for our 
essentially relative faculties, an absolute validity.</P> 

<P>  Moved by these considerations, a number of modern philosophers 
dare to claim for human knowledge only some correspondence with its 
object which is less than that of likeness, and is describable as 
symbolic: just as a mathematical formula, though not like, may yet 
symbolize, the path of a cannon-ball.  Thus, in the words of Mr. 
Frederick Harrison, "our scientific conceptions have a very good 
working correspondence with the assumed reality without; but we have no 
means of knowing whether the absolute correspondence between them be 
great or small, or whether there be any absolute correspondence at 
all." Mr. H. Spencer,<A HREF="#N_2_"><sup><small>{2}</small></sup></A> in expounding 
his theory of "transfigured realism," sets forth still more clearly the 
position of the "relativist," that is, of the philosopher who denies 
that we can know things absolutely as they are.  Maintaining that 
"<EM>resistance</EM>, as disclosed by opposition to our energies, is 
the only species of external activity which we are obliged to think of 
as subjectively and objectively the same," still even here he will not 
positively affirm that knowledge is like the object.  And for ordinary 
objects his teaching is this: "If <EM>x</EM> and <EM>y</EM> are the 
two uniformly connected properties in some outer object, while 
<EM>a</EM> and <EM>b</EM> are the effects which they produce in our 
consciousness; the sole need is that <EM>a</EM> and <EM>b</EM>, and the 
relation between them, shall always answer to <EM>x</EM> and 
<EM>y</EM>, and the relation between them.  It matters not if 
<EM>a</EM> and <EM>b</EM> are both like <EM>x</EM> and <EM>y</EM>, or 
not; could they be exactly identical with them we should not be one 
whit the better, and their total dissimilarity is no disadvantage."<A 
HREF="#N_3_"><sup><small>{3}</small></sup></A>  In other words, if for every definite 
change in objects, there is one constant change in the mind which is 
affected by that object, then this is enough, without any resemblance 
of thought to thing; concomitant variation suffices.</P> 

<P>(c)  Against this theory the time-honoured definition of knowledge 
must be re-affirmed.  The objections raised against it are only the old 
arguments in favour of complete distrust in the power of man to attain 
truth; and to refute them will be the main purpose of all that follows 
in this volume.  At the outset, this book defines truth of intellect to 
be "the conformity of thought to thing": subsequently its one grand aim 
will be gradually to make good the definition.  Whilst patiently 
awaiting the development of a long line of argument, the reader may 
find some consolation in a few declarations that can be offered him at 
once.  First of all, when knowledge is said to be a sort of "equation" 
of mind to thing, it is not meant that knowledge, in order to be true, 
must exhaust the whole object: a partial knowledge is true, as far as 
it goes, especially when it is recognized as only partial.</P> 

<P>Next, the likeness which is asserted is quite <EM>sui generis</EM>.  
An idea, -- to use the word at present in its broad sense of any act of 
knowledge, -- is not a dead picture, but something effected by and in 
the living, cognitive mind; it is a thing with a conscious meaning of 
its own:<A HREF="#N_4_"><sup><small>{4}</small></sup></A> it is, as Spinoza says, 
self-assertive or self-referent; it is what the schoolmen sometimes 
call a <EM>signum a quo,</EM> a sign which taken, not in its isolation 
as a mere phenomenon, but as it exists in the mind, is the knowledge of 
the thing signified.  Thus it differs from a <EM>signum ex quo,</EM> a 
sign which has first to be known, that from it the mind may travel to 
the thing signified.  To quote Father Liberatore: "The <EM>signum a 
quo</EM> is that which, by being first known, leads on the mind to the 
knowledge of the thing it signifies.  Another way of signifying is 
presented to us in those inward signs which do not come before the mind 
as objects of its perceptions, but which, by informing the cognitive 
faculty, effect actual knowledge.  These latter may be called <EM>signa 
in quibus</EM> [or, <EM>signa quibus</EM>], or also, 'formal signs,' in 
that they do not represent objects as previously known, but are forms 
determining the mind to perceive the object.  To this category belong 
mental concepts."<A HREF="#N_5_"><sup><small>{5}</small></sup></A> Hence the 
representative, significative, or meaning power of an idea is not 
photographic, nor anything analogous to photography; and to fancy it so 
is the cardinal error of scepticism.  The idea depicts its object in 
no way open to our artists: neither by similarity of substance, nor of 
colour, nor of outline, nor by any mode of material portraiture.  The 
process is so peculiarly mental or spiritual, that illustrations 
borrowed from matter are more calculated to mislead than to direct.  
The uniqueness of the phenomenon is essentially its strangeness, for we 
cannot explain it by reduction to any familiar class.  Yet the 
strangeness is welcome as serving, in another treatise, to show the 
inadequacy of the materialistic hypothesis.</P> 

<P>A difficulty, raised by Cousin, really amounts to no more than a 
matter of words.  He says<A HREF="#N_6_"><sup><small>{6}</small></sup></A> that an 
idea cannot be "an image" of an object, because only material 
representations can be "images;" that we cannot strictly speak of 
"likeness" between spiritual objects, but only between material: and 
that therefore, if we do call ideas "images" bearing the "likeness" 
of their objects, we are talking not properly but metaphorically.  As 
our knowledge begins in sense, so far all our spiritual ideas may be 
said to be conveyed in metaphorical terms; it seems however a fair 
procedure to regard a term as no longer metaphorical, when we no longer 
advert to the figurative meaning, but pass straight to the main object.  
Thus, in speaking of moral rectitude we hardly refer to the image of a 
man keeping the straight path as he walks; but we go at once to the 
notion of right conduct.  Similarly, whatever may have been the origin 
of the terms, we can now claim to apply the word "image" or "likeness" 
straight to spiritual resemblances.  However, if any one should insist 
on seeing a trace of metaphor left here, the point is not worth 
controverting.</P> 

<P>We assume, therefore, that ideas are, in the language of Aristotle, 
<b>homoi&ocirc;mata t&ocirc;n pragmat&ocirc;n</b> -- "likenesses of 
things," and so stand contrasted with words which are conventional 
signs: whereby a special meaning is given to the saying, that man is a 
microcosm.<A HREF="#N_7_"><sup><small>{7}</small></sup></A> Not only does man sum 
up the several constituents of our Cosmos by uniting together mineral, 
vegetable, and animal nature; but by knowing all things, he, in a 
manner, reproduces, or becomes all things.  <EM>Homo est quod est,</EM>
says the materialist scoffingly; translating the words, "Man is 
what he eats, what his food makes him." False as a complete statement, 
this is true as a partial statement; and equally true is it, <EM>homo 
est quod scit</EM> -- Man is what he knows." In this sense St. 
Thomas writes <EM>{anima est quomodo omnia</EM>The soul is in 
some sense everything;" which is the repetition of Aristotle,<A 
HREF="#N_8_"><sup><small>{8}</small></sup></A> <b>he psuch&ecirc; ta onta p&ocirc;s 
esti panta</b> -- "The soul is in a manner all things."</P>

<P>3.	From the definition of true knowledge before given, a corollary as 
to the nature of error may be gathered.  Not any absence of likeness 
between thought and thing is straightway falsehood: rather such mere 
absence is ignorance.  Before downright error is reached, there must be 
not only want of conformity but positive deformity.  For knowledge, 
however limited, is true knowledge so long as it does not transgress or 
deny its own limits -- a fact highly important to finite intelligences 
like ourselves who can but "know in part." Be it our consolation, 
then, to remember that the opposition between knowledge and ignorance 
is only what the logicians call a "contradictory; " while it is not 
till we have gone as far as the "contrary" opposition that we commit 
error.</P> 

<P><CENTER>ADDENDA.</CENTER></P>

<P>(i) The mysteriousness of the act of knowledge, and its apparent 
impossibility on any material analogy, were points that arrested the 
attention of the early speculators.  Whereas St. Thomas <sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> argued that 
because the mind was capable of becoming cognizant of bodies it could 
not itself be corporeal, some of the old Greeks had pushed to its 
extremes the principle, Like is known by like -- <b>homoia homoiois 
gign&ocirc;sketei</b>.  Empedocles, for example, had said,  "We 
perceive earth by means of earth, water by means of water, air by means 
of air, fire by means of fire, love by means of love, and strife by 
means of strife," where love and strife stand for what we call 
attractive and repulsive forces.  Others spoke either of the eye 
sending out its influences to the object, or of the object emitting its 
<b>eid&ocirc;la</b>, or minute images to the eye, which,</P> 

<ul>

<P>	Like little films from outer surface torn,<br>
	In mid air, to and fro, are lightly borne.<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup></P>

</ul>

<P>	All such conceptions are the follies of a crude materialism; and a 
long way the better course is, while admitting that <EM>how</EM> 
knowledge is possible is inscrutable to us, yet to insist that the fact 
is manifest to experience.  The reaction of our faculties to their 
appropriate <EM>stimuli</EM> must simply be accepted for what it --
declares itself to be, namely, not any kind of a reaction, but the 
special reaction which must be called cognitive.</P> 

<P>(2) Preferring theory to fact, and a theory the very arguments for 
which rest on an assumption which is just the contrary to what they are 
fancied to prove, a number of modern writers quite set aside the 
doctrine that we have knowledge like to the realities outside of 
ourselves.  From America comes the voice of Mr. Borden Browne, telling 
us, as an introduction to his volume on <EM>Metaphysics,</EM> that 
because we cannot compare thought with being, therefore, "truth cannot 
be viewed as the, correspondence of thought and thing, but as the 
universally valid in our thought of the thing.  That is the true 
conception of reality, which grasps the common to all, and not the 
special to one;" so that the test of truth is "the necessity of the 
conception and the inner harmony between several conceptions.  It is 
not the lack of harmony between our conceptions and reality which 
disturbs, but the discord of our conceptions among themselves." A like 
utterance we have from a German author, according to whom "truth does 
not consist in any sort of correspondence between our thought and the 
things outside us, but in a character that belongs to our mode of 
putting together our internal experiences.  Our thoughts are true, when 
their nature, as internal events, is understood; when they are placed 
in equal relation to the rest of experience.  The criterion of truth is 
the feeling of universality and necessity in the ultimate axioms." In 
our own country we have some authors completely rejecting the doctrine 
that truth is conformity of mind to thing; while others, using the same 
words, are less thorough in their divergence from us, though 
sufficiently divergent to be in decided opposition.  They distinguish 
between perception and thought, so as to make thought more especially a 
matter of subjective forms without ascertainable objective validity.  
"Truth relatively to the human mind," writes Mansel,<sup><small><a href="#n_c">{c}</a></small></sup> "cannot be 
defined as a conformity with its object; for to us the object exists 
only as it is known by one or other faculty.  Hence <EM>material</EM> 
truth consists rather in the conformity of the object as represented in 
thought with the object as presented in intuition; while logical truth 
consists in the conformity of thought to its own laws." With these 
words may be compared the following from another countryman of ours, 
Mr. S. Hodgson: "Without thought no truth, without perception no 
reality.  By reality I understand the actual existence of the object, 
its actual presence to consciousness.<sup><small><a href="#n_d">{d}</a></small></sup> Reality is not greater after 
thought than before; thought has, transformed it into a new shape, has 
given it new relations, but has added nothing to its real existence. 
Truth, on the other hand, is a product of thought, the form which an 
object assumes after investigation, and is thus greater after thought 
than before it.  Reality depends on the relation between objects and 
consciousness: truth on the relation between objects in consciousness." 
The difference here is partly a matter of words, but it is also a 
matter of fundamental doctrine; and with regard to each of the authors, 
cited, it is sufficient for present purposes if the reader understands 
them as representatives of a now widespread revolt against the 
scholastic definition, "All truth in cognition consists of the 
assimilation or conformity of the mind with the object."<sup><small><a href="#n_e">{e}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>(3) The consequences of the doctrine logically carried out, that 
ideas are mere symbols, are very fatal to all religious belief, as well 
as to everything worth calling true knowledge: and though it is often 
protested, that a doctrine is not to be judged by its inconvenient 
logical consequences, but by its intrinsic truth, yet there are 
consequences so manifestly bad, as to afford evidence that the 
premisses, whence they are drawn, cannot be sound.  If our knowledge of 
things is what adversaries say it is, then it is not genuine knowledge 
at all: and this some of themselves admit.  Take, for instance, Lange's 
confession, in words gathered from a long declaration: "All our 
knowledge of nature is, in fact, no knowledge at all, and affords us 
merely the substitute for an explanation.  The intelligible world is. a 
world of poesy, and precisely upon this fact rests its worth and 
nobility.  No thought is so calculated to reconcile poesy and science 
as the thought, that all our reality is only appearance."<sup><small><a href="#n_f">{f}</a></small></sup> So, too, 
Mr. Spencer<sup><small><a href="#n_g">{g}</a></small></sup> is perpetually harping on the string, "ultimate 
religious ideas, and ultimate scientific ideas are mere symbols of the 
actual, not cognitions;" even "the personality of which each is 
conscious, and of which the existence is to each a fact beyond all 
others the most certain, cannot be truly known at all: knowledge of it 
is forbidden by the very nature of thought." It is well that the reader 
should thus be brought plainly to see into what a gulf of nescience he 
is about to plunge, if he is resolved to take up the theory, that the 
old definition of man's actual knowledge must be abandoned.  Ultimately 
he must be driven to say with Fichte, <sup><small><a href="#n_h">{h}</a></small></sup> "Reality all merges into a 
marvellous dream, without life to dream about or spirit to dream -- a 
dream which is gathered up into a dream of itself."</P> 

<P>(4) In unconscious anticipation of modern difficulties, the 
scholastics strongly insisted on knowledge as being <i>mental 
assimilation;</i> in proof of which assertion we will borrow a few 
citations made by Kleutgen on this subject.<sup><small><a href="#n_i">{i}</a></small></sup> "Every cognition is 
brought about by the likeness of the object known, in the mind that 
knows."<sup><small><a href="#n_j">{j}</a></small></sup> "In the first place, we suppose it to be essential to the 
act of the intellect, aye, and to every cognition, that a certain 
assimilation be produced in the mind of the intelligent agent. This 
fundamental position may be taken to be a dogma and a principle both in 
theology and in philosophy, questioned by none."<sup><small><a href="#n_k">{k}</a></small></sup> It can in no wise 
be denied, that when the rational mind, reflecting on itself, becomes 
self-conscious, a likeness of itself is produced by this cognition, or 
even that this cognition is an image of self, fashioned after its own 
likeness, as it were an impression of self upon self."<sup><small><a href="#n_l">{l}</a></small></sup> 
Theologically the doctrine is of importance in reference to the Blessed 
Trinity, in, which the Son is begotten in the likeness of the Father, 
as the Father's Word, or intelligible term.<sup><small><a href="#n_m">{m}</a></small></sup> Silvester Maurus has 
some apposite remarks: "The procession of the Son is of such sort as to 
express the Father in His nature and essence.  The act of the 
intellect, whereby we know ourselves, is likewise posited for the 
purpose of expressing the intelligent agent in his essence and nature, 
into which the intellect alone can penetrate.  Since in God, the Word, 
<i>i.e.,</i> the term produced by the act of the intellect, receives 
the self-same nature and essence with the Father, His production or 
procession is hence fitly termed a generation, that is, the origin of a 
living subject from a conjoint living principle, from whom it receives 
a similar nature."<sup><small><a href="#n_n">{n}</a></small></sup></P>
