<P>As builders clear the ground before they begin to build, so we shall 
do well to start by putting out of the way certain proposed criteria of 
truth, which either we cannot accept as criteria at all, or else not as 
ultimate criteria.</P> 

<P>Some philosophers, often more in appearance than in reality, or more 
as an occasional aberration than as an opinion steadily maintained 
throughout, represent the cause of our assents to be, in last analysis, 
a <EM>blind instinct to believe.</EM>  What is true in their doctrine 
is, that we cannot penetrate the secret of the intellectual act, and 
see bow it is that this most wonderful act, the act of knowledge, is 
elicited from the faculty.  The conscious process we are aware of 
because it is conscious; but the physical process, so to term it, we do 
not comprehend.  When we think of the marvellousness of intelligence, 
we are quite lost in the mystery of the process, and almost feel 
inclined to doubt whether our knowledge is not illusion.  To this 
extent intelligence gives no explanation of itself.  But to say that we 
assent by a blind instinct, is to take out of the assent its percipient 
character, to render it non-intellectual, to make it a contradiction in 
terms.  Allowing, therefore, that the manner in which we understand is 
impenetrably dark, we cannot allow that the understanding itself acts 
in the dark, by means of blind instinct.  Its essence is to see its way 
as it goes.</P> 

<P>2. The first proposal can hardly be called that of a criterion, for 
a criterion supposes something genuinely intellectual; but the second 
proposal does offer something which, at least, is in the cognitive 
order, though in the lowest grade of cognition.  The criterion is 
<EM>verification by the senses.</EM>  Lewes, who, in his <EM>Problems 
of Life and Mind,</EM> is one of its strong advocates, insists that the 
great mass of our thoughts, being abstract, generalized products, are 
only symbolic of the real, and must be reduced to their first origin in 
sensation, if their value is to be tested.  Our sensations are as the 
arithmetic of objects, our conceptions are as the algebra, that is, 
symbolic expressions.  Besides the criterion of sense, however, he 
allows a secondary, derivative criterion, which consists in reduction 
to intellectual intuition, Mill cannot quite be put in the same class 
with Lewes, for he speaks of the necessity we are under to accept all 
averments of consciousness, provided that they can be shown to belong 
to its pure, primitive state.  Still the following passage will show 
how inclined he was to make sensation a sort of ultimate test: "When I 
say that I am convinced there are icebergs in the Arctic sea, I mean 
that the evidence is equal to that of my senses; I am as certain of the 
fact as if I had seen it.  And on a more complete analysis, when I say 
that I am convinced of it, what I am convinced of is, that if I were on 
the Arctic seas I should see it.  We mean by knowledge and by certainty 
an assurance similar and equal to that effected by our senses.  If the 
evidence can in any case be brought up to this, we desire no 
more."<sup><small><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>Here Mill evidently is speaking, not of mere sensation, but of 
intellectual perceptions following after sensations.  However, the 
precise nature of neither his doctrine nor of that of Lewes need 
trouble us at present; for we want no accurate estimates of different 
philosophies, but only a refutation of the broad proposition, that the 
ultimate criterion of truth is verification by the senses.  Now a 
sufficient objection to this view is the two-fold fact, that a more 
sensation, as such, cannot be the direct criterion for an intellectual 
faculty, and that we have many certitudes about objects which are 
supra-sensible. What, however, we may allow to verification by the 
senses is, that often a physical theory, carried through several steps 
by the mere reasoning process, requires to be brought to the test of 
observation or experiment, in order to make sure that the reasoning is 
consecutive and leaves out none of the involved data.  Thus it was 
right to look actually with the telescope for the planet, the position 
of which Adams and Leverrier had mathematically calculated.  But in all 
cases alike certitude itself is intellectual, and must have a criterion 
directly intellectual.</P> 

<P>3. Distrustful of self, man is inclined to make his last appeal to 
his fellows, especially to the majority of men; and more especially to 
the majority, if they are supposed to be the divinely appointed 
custodians of a primitive revelation.  Thus we have the <EM>appeal to 
Tradition</EM> as an ultimate criterion of truth.  
<EM>Traditionalism</EM> is a doctrine which has had some vogue in 
France.  Long ago our own John of Salisbury had written: "As both the 
senses and human reason frequently go astray, God has laid in faith the 
first foundation for the knowledge of truth."<sup><small><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup> A sober interpretation 
may be given to a sentence like this, but Bayle was outraging alike God 
and man, when he pretended utterly to discredit human reason, in order 
to make way for the sole reign of faith.  "Human reason is a principle 
of destruction, not of construction; it is capable solely of raising 
questions, and of doubling about to make a controversy endless. The 
best use that can be made of philosophy is to acknowledge that it can
but set us astray, and that we must seek another guide, which is the 
light of Revelation."<sup><small><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>In recent times the principle here enunciate has been taken up by 
men far more earnest than Bayle, but all their earnestness has failed 
to make a dangerous doctrine safe.  The pith of De Bonald' teaching is 
given in a single sentence of his: "This . . . proposition, Thought can 
be known but by it expression, that is, by speech, sums up the whole 
science of man."<sup><small><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></small></sup> Taking up the idea of De Bonald, De Lamennais, in 
his famous <EM>Essai sur l'Indiff&eacute;rence dans la Mati&egrave;re de 
Religion,</EM> elaborated a scheme of traditionalism.  He supposed a 
primitive communication of truth from above to the race. Then, working 
on a principle which Aristotle mentions but does not sanction, and 
which Lord Herbert of Cherbury, in his treatise <EM>De Veritate,</EM> 
had adopted, namely, "What appears to all men, that is true," he 
embraced it to the extent of affirming that the consent of the majority 
determines what is the authentic tradition, or, in other words, what is 
the truth.</P> 

<P> A most glaring objection to the theory starts up at once in the 
shape of the obviously raised question, "If the consent of mankind is 
the ultimate test of truth, how do we know that such is the fact, and 
how do we judge, in any particular case, what is the view of the 
majority?" De Lamennais himself acknowleged his inability to furnish 
a precise reply; but all the same he adhered to his traditionalism." 
The first man receives the primary truths on the testimony of God, the 
highest Reason.  These truths are preserved for mankind, as being ever 
set forth by universal testimony, which is the expression of general 
reason, of common sense."<sup><small><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></small></sup> Whence he argued that the first act of 
intelligence is an act of faith; so necessarily, that unless a man will 
begin with "I believe," he will never arrive at "I know."</P> 

<P>With a view to giving his opinion an air of reality, De Lamennais 
laboriously collected, from many languages, testimonies to the opinion 
that primitive man drew from divine sources, and that present 
controversies are to be settled by reference to what has been taught 
from the beginning.  In its right place the principle of tradition is 
sound enough, and that right place is pre-eminently the position of the 
<EM>depositum fidei,</EM> the body of revealed truths committed by 
Christ to the keeping of His Church; but De Lamennais puts the 
principle into a wrong place altogether.  It is impossible that man 
should ever give, as the ultimate reason of his belief, "Because I was 
told;" when and why be should accept what he is told, is always a 
question going deeper down.</P> 

<P>Apart from any faith in a revelation, some might urge the 
<EM>consent of the majority of men</EM> as a natural rule of truth.  
Against them it suffices to say that such rule, for the most part, 
cannot be reduced to practice, and is sometimes fallible, never 
ultimate.  Yet there is a great truth hinted at, namely, the 
impossibility of any one man discovering everything for himself by 
independent research, without the aid of the accumulated treasures of 
the age.  What could Newton have done, had he been born into an age 
when the simple rules of arithmetic formed all that was known of 
mathematics? An important' condition of progress is, that knowledge 
should accumulate; and a sufficient cause of unprogressiveness in 
animal intelligence is its want of power properly to preserve and build 
upon a tradition.  There is, of course, among the lower animals some 
sort of heredity in matter of transmitted experiences; but there is 
not, in the human sense, a power of tradition and development.  Man has 
this power, and it is his wisdom not to sacrifice it by self-
isolation.</P> 

<P><4. <EM>Blind instinct</EM> we have rejected as being outside the 
pale of knowledge altogether; <EM>verification</EM> by the senses as 
being the lowest grade of cognition, so long as it means mere sensitive 
knowledge; tradition as being inadequate and never ultimate; and now we 
come to a pretended <EM>vision of things in God,</EM> or in 
<EM>divinely infused ideas,</EM> which also we must reject.  The chief 
arguments of those who hold such opinions, run on the lines that 
without Divine aid we could not have the knowledge of which we find 
ourselves possessed.  The best mode of replying to the so-called 
demonstrations, is to show that they amount to no more than so many 
ways of re-stating the dangerous assumption, that human faculties have 
not the natural power of intelligence, but must, at least to a large 
extent, have their work done for them by their Creator.  No such 
helplessness can be proved, and the assertion of it sounds more 
injurious than honourable to God.  Our experience is, not that we 
descend from ideas or principles which are a gift, down to our own 
concrete applications of them, but that we ascend from concrete facts 
to abstract ideas and principles; nor that we travel from a knowledge 
of the divine to knowledge of the created, but that our course lies 
from the created to the divine.  The fewness of the supporters of what 
may be called the view of Malebranche, makes it unnecessary to go at 
length into the two charges against it, which are that it brings no 
proof and goes contrary to rightly interpreted experience.<sup><small><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></small></sup>

<P>5.To assert that <EM>clear and distinct ideas</EM> are the ultimate 
test of truth, might be correct if the clearness and distinctness were 
sufficiently shown to be more than subjective feeling, and to be 
founded on objective evidence.  What has been explained of the system 
of Descartes was enough to make manifest his great shortcomings in this 
particular; nor does Spinoza give a more satisfactory shape to the 
theory when he teaches that true ideas are guaranteed by the 
consciousness of truth wherewith they are accompanied.  Of course from 
the subjective side our certainty is our consciousness that we are 
certain; but the objective side also needs to be fully stated, whereas 
both by Descartes and Spinoza it is neglected.  In the next chapter it 
will form the main subject of inquiry.</P> 

<P>6. As truth can never conflict with truth, what proves inconsistent 
in its parts cannot, as a whole, be true.  As a secondary test of 
truth, therefore, <EM>consistency</EM> is useful; but it cannot be made 
the ultimate criterion, for there may be consistency in error.  The 
wider and the more varied is the range of the consistent statements, 
the higher, <EM>caeteris paribus,</EM> is the probability of their 
being true; still if we allow that consistency throughout our 
judgments is all we can produce in proof, while we can never tie down 
the consistent whole of our thoughts to objective reality, our ideas 
are still a floating mass, well compacted together, but anchored safely 
to nothing substantial.  We may have a beautiful arch, key-stone 
included, but what if there are no pillars for it to rest on?</P> 

<P>It is, therefore, lamentable to find so many writers declaring the 
inability of man to get anything beyond consistency as a basis of 
certitude.  Of necessity they must speak thus who push the doctrine of 
relativity to extremes; but others adopt the criterion under less 
pressure from their system: "We cannot," says Mansel, "know what truth 
is in relation to a non-human intellect; and truth in man admits of no 
other test than the harmonious consent of all the human faculties." 
This must be interpreted in conformity with the principles laid down by 
the author,<sup><small><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></small></sup> that we cannot test the absolute validity of our own 
mental laws, but that we must trust our Creator for having given us 
powers sufficient for our present state of probation, and rely upon it 
"that the portion of knowledge of which our limited faculties are 
permitted to attain to here may indeed, in the eves of a higher 
Intelligence, be but partial truth, but cannot be absolute falsehood.  
But believing this, we desert the evidence of reason to rest on that of 
faith; and of the principles on which reason itself depends it is 
obviously impossible to have any other guarantee." Thus we are left 
with the incomplete result "that the laws to which our faculties are 
subjected, though not absolutely binding on things in themselves, are 
binding upon our mode of contemplating them:" a conclusion which leaves 
us open to many of Kant's sceptical difficulties.  Again, Mr. 
Spencer,<sup><small><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></small></sup> whose further test, from the inconceivability of the 
opposite, will be considered presently, thus expresses himself: "There 
is no mode of establishing any belief, except that of showing its 
entire congruity with the other beliefs.  Debarred as we are from 
anything beyond the relative, truth raised to its highest form can be 
for us nothing more than perfect agreement, throughout the whole range 
of our experience, between those representations of things which we 
distinguish as real. lishment of congruity throughout the whole of our 
cognitions constitutes philosophy."  Thus with Mr. Spencer the avowed 
process is to assume provisionally the simple states of consciousness; 
upon these to elaborate a system; and in the end to claim acceptance 
for it on the plea of the complete congruity which has resulted from 
philosophizing with the assumed elements for starting-points.  Two more 
instances shall be borrowed from quite a different school of thought to 
that of Mr. Spencer.  "The ultimate test of each truth," writes Mr. 
Caird, in his work on Kant, "a test which at the same time fixes the 
limit of its validity, lies in the exhibition of its relation to other 
truths in a system.  Thus philosophy is a kind of reasoning in a 
circle; but this is no argument against it, for it is the circle beyond 
which nothing lies.  The ultimate unity of knowledge must be that in 
which all the elements of knowledge are reflected into each other; in 
which the parts cannot be apprehended except as merging in the whole, 
and the whole cannot be apprehended except as necessarily 
differentiating itself into parts.  The essential presupposition of all 
philosophy is, that the world is an intelligible system, and therefore 
capable of being understood and explained." This view becomes all the 
more intelligible if read in the light of a Hegelian principle which 
Mr.Wallace, at the beginning of his work on <EM>The Logic of 
Hegel,</EM> thus enunciates: "All the objects of science, all terms of 
knowledge, lead out of themselves, and seek for a centre and resting-
point.  They are severally inadequate and partial, and crave adequacy 
and completeness.  They tend to organize themselves, and so to 
constitute a system or universe, and in this tendency to unity consists 
their truth: their untruth lies in isolation and pretended 
independence.  This completed unity in which all things receive their 
entireness and become adequate is their truth: and the truth as known 
in religious language is God."</P> 

<P>If consistency throughout the entire body of truths were the only 
criterion, even the most learned man could never make use of it, for he 
never knows all truths; and the man of little education could hardly 
claim any certitude, for his knowledge is so limited, and he has done 
nothing to harmonize the different parts of his slender stock.  On the 
other hand, as a fact, the ablest thinker among men may, on secure 
grounds, hold truths, the consistency of which he fails to perceive, 
though of course he perceives no positive inconsistency.  When further 
we repeat that consistency alone, without a guarantee of objectivity, 
is insufficient, we have given reasons enough for rejecting the 
proposed criterion.  A consistent novel is not history, and a 
consistent account of the evolution of the universe is not proved true 
till it be connected with reality.  A theory like that of La Place 
might be possible, without being verified in fact.</P> 

<P>Still consistency is an excellent test in its own sphere, and Mr. 
Spencer might have been saved some of the chapters which he has 
unfortunately written had he been more alive to the use of his own 
criterion, consistency.  For example, Part I. of his <EM>First 
Principles</EM> is largely employed in drawing up a list of antinomies, 
which, on his theory of knowledge, are forced upon the human mind.  Now 
these antinomies are not saved from being inconsistencies of assertion, 
by his adroit distinction between <EM>knowledge</EM> and <EM>indefinite 
consciousness</EM>. Verbiage apart, it is inconsistent to maintain 
that we must firmly <EM>believe</EM> the existence of the Absolute, but 
must deem it quite <EM>unknowable;</EM> that we must <EM>believe</EM> 
in the Non-Relative, but confine our knowledge to the Relative. Just 
what Mr. Spencer wants is escape from his doctrine of Relativity.</P> 

<P>7. <EM>inconceivability</EM> being itself a negative term, does not 
promise well, at first sight, to be a good ultimate criterion; while it 
has the additional misfortune to be a term which is used with varieties 
of meanings.<sup><small><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></small></sup> To clear up the case, it is quite necessary to start 
with a distinction between what can be represented by the sensitive 
imagination and what can be represented by the intellect strictly so 
called. 

(a) As regards the sensitive imagination, what cannot be pictured by it 
need not, on that account, be impossible or untrue; else all our 
highest truths would straightway be undone.  Contrariwise, what can be 
roughly pictured by the imagination may, as a concrete fact, be quite 
incapable of realization.  A chillagon, the square Of 123456789, a 
mathematical straight line, the morality of an act, are all objects 
with which the intellect may most accurately deal; but they all baffle 
accurate imagination by the sensitive faculty.  On the other side, in a 
rough way, the imagination can form a sort of outline picture of a man 
standing on a single hair of his head, of Atlas supporting the world, 
of the cow jumping over the moon, all which feats the intelligence 
pronounces physically impossible.  They ought not, therefore, to be 
called without qualification, as they sometimes are, conceivable; for 
the conception never traces out the whole details, or it would find 
itself brought across absurdities.  It follows that the possibility or 
the impossibility of picturing the opposite will not serve as the last, 
universal criterion of truth, -- a conclusion for which we have already 
found sufficient reason, when we were considering the criterion 
afforded by verification through the senses.</P> 

<P>Nevertheless, just as verification through the senses, in its own 
order, is an excellent and practically indispensable test of scientific 
theory, yet never so that mere sensation is the ultimate criterion of 
intellectual truth; in like manner all that Mr. Tyndall has eloquently 
uttered about the scientific use of the imagination in visualizing the 
minute processes of nature, must be granted to the full measure of the 
truth contained in his declarations. But sensitive imagination is not 
the last test of certainty of the universal proposition in its 
universality, of the spiritual truth in its spirituality, nay, not even 
of the sensitive fact as stated in strict propositional form.  A highly 
important consequence is the revelation of the truth, that with many 
persons their so-called intellectual difficulties against the Trinity, 
the existence of the soul, and the life after death, are not really 
intellectual difficulties at all, but difficulties of the imagination 
in its vain effort to picture the unpicturable.  The proof is, that 
such people have no arguments to plead; only a baffled imagination.<sup><small><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></small></sup>
</P> 

<P>(b) The question must now be narrowed down to intellectual 
inconceivability; in which shape it calls for yet another distinction.  
If inconceivability of the opposite is taken negatively, for a mere 
impotence, it is not the ultimate criterion; for obviously the mere 
inability of a finite mind to see how a thing could be otherwise than 
as conceived by it, is no proof that the thing could not be otherwise.  
The simple incompetence of the spectators to conceive how a conjurer 
can do otherwise than betray certain indications, in some piece of 
sleight of hand, does not prove that he cannot avoid the betrayal.  The 
point is too clear to allow of serious dispute, unless a man has the 
self-assurance to fancy, that there is no possibility beyond his Powers 
of conception.  We are left, therefore, to deal with positive 
inconceivability.  What for positive reasons is seen to be such that 
its contradictory is impossible, implies more than a mere <EM>impotence 
to conceive:</EM> it implies a power to perceive that something cannot 
be.  That must be true, the opposite of which is thus seen to be 
inconceivable.  But it is a clumsy choice to pick out precisely the 
inconceivability as the ultimate criterion; for the more important 
element is the positive conceivability, or the evidence that something 
is as we see it to be.  Whoever judges that something certainly is, 
implicitly judges that under the circumstances the opposite is 
inconceivable; the thing must be so and cannot be otherwise, however 
contingent may have been the fact of its realization. Here, however, 
what best deserves to be called the criterion of the judgment is its 
objective evidence. It is not primarily because we cannot conceive the 
opposite, that we believe that two and two make four; but because we 
perceive the necessary identity between twice two and four.  Even when 
a proposition is said to be proven negatively, the case is the same.  
In the <EM>reductio ad absurdum,</EM> and in the proof by exclusion of 
all hypotheses but one, positive conceivability is still the guide; 
evidence is the criterion.<sup><small><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>Inasmuch, then, as Mr. Spencer's criterion agrees with the one to be 
advocated in the next chapter, there is nothing to dispute with him; 
inasmuch as it is vague, inadequate, and incorrect, it is to be 
repudiated.  Besides those already indicated, one great flaw in it is 
its admitted fallibility, on account of which the author affirms that 
the less frequently his "universal postulate" enters into an argument, 
the better, for the less is the liability to error.  Every use of the 
criterion is a fresh possibility of mistake.  This premised, his rule 
is: Reduce any proposition to its simplest statements; then apply to 
each the test of the inconceivability of the opposite: the result is 
the nearest approach you can make to truth, while your dangers of 
having gone wrong are to be estimated by the number of times you have 
had to use your criterion."<sup><small><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>8. Here must end the review of criteria to be rejected; and from 
what has been seen, one conclusion impressed upon us should be, that 
the real criterion will have to accord with what we know to be the real 
nature of human intelligence.  If a man steadily refuses to rise above 
the standard of associated sensations and their residues, if he will 
not ascend beyond the conception of <EM>L'Homme Machine,</EM> he can 
never hope to find a test of genuine certitude, for be is tied down to 
mere empiricism, or the doctrine which builds up knowledge out of mere 
associated ideas of experience, without any substantial soul that has 
an active power of intelligence.  In a good sense we are all 
empiricists.  The schoolmen admit no innate ideas, no knowledge which 
has not an origin experience; yet they are not what we call pure 
empiricists.  They strongly maintain that the Leibnitzian 
<EM>salvo</EM> to a famous empirical rule is not mere verbiage, but 
expresses an important fact.  As every one knows, to "Nought is in the 
mind which was not previously in the senses,"<sup><small><a href="#n_13">{13}</a></small></sup> Leibnitz added, "Save 
the mind itself,"<sup><small><a href="#n_14">{14}</a></small></sup> a most substantial addition against those who 
speak as though mind were a mere series of phenomenal states inherent 
in no substance.  What seems a truism becomes really an important truth 
in opposition to those who deny it either formally or equivalently.  
The schoolmen make much of the doctrine that the intellect is no "mere 
abstraction turned into an entity," is not a mere name for the 
aggregate of all our ideas, but a principle of action, present from 
earliest infancy, though not ready to come into proper play till 
certain material conditions leave been developed.  In its activity, 
however, human intellect is subject to a condition analogous to that 
<EM>inertia,</EM> whereby matter does not act unless acted upon.  Mind 
cannot act without some initiation on the part of the senses.  Many 
points are left obscure, but what we gather with certainty from the 
interpretation of experience is, that the same soul which shares in 
eliciting the sensation, on the occurrence of the sensation frequently 
proceeds to a corresponding act of intelligence; and that intelligence, 
once possessed of ideas, has a large fund of power peculiar to itself, 
whereby it is enabled to push its knowledge far beyond the bare 
sensitive data. No doubt these data always form some limit to 
intellect, in such sort that the physicist must be perpetually feeding 
his mind with new observations; but on this account to deny the special 
power of intellect to enlarge upon its original data, is simply 
preposterous.</P> 

<P>Consider the case of a man who has been a great observer, but not 
much of a thinker: if suddenly he becomes blind, and spends the rest of 
a long life in elaborating his acquired materials, what vast progress 
he may make in real science! Consider, again, the ample and objectively 
valid results due to geometry, synthetic and analytic; to mathematics 
generally; to mental and moral philosophy; and it will appear how 
mighty is that action of thought which supervenes upon sensation, and 
carries its conquests into regions not less real because their objects 
are not able to act on the sense organs.  As the acute disciple may 
pass in thought beyond what his duller teacher tells him, so and still 
more may intellect pass beyond its source in sensation.  It is, 
therefore, the veriest perversity to limit reality to the data of 
sense, and to declare all besides to be mere "symbolism," of no value 
except so far as it can be reduced back again to its sensible 
beginnings.  Intellect is always valid so long as it proceeds in the 
only way which is intelligent, namely, not by blind mechanism or 
instinct alone, but with insight, seeing its way as it goes.  Viewing 
it thus, we shall reach a criterion of certitude.</P> 

<P>But for pure empiricists, with all their boasted adherence to the 
most literal realities, there is nothing left but that blank result, 
which Mr. Huxley says cannot be disproved -- an empty idealism with no 
assured basis of reality.  Their "objective and subjective sides," 
their "phenomena of the <EM>ego</EM> and phenomena of the <EM>non-
ego,"</EM> their "faint and vivid aggregates," all turn out to be mere 
shadowsshadows of the Unknowable, that is, of the Unthinkable, that is, 
of Nothing.  Brahm, or Buthos, or Chaos, or the Mundane Egg, were names 
accounting for the universe of which we are conscious just as validly 
as do some recent speculations, which are supposed by their authors to 
be far above the old mythologies.  In face of such disastrous 
philosophizing, we may well be moved to search after some really valid 
criterion of truth.</P> 

<P>ADDENDA.</P>

<P>(1)It would be small satisfaction to be told, that the laws of our 
nature are such as to compel us to accept certain propositions, if 
meanwhile our enforced belief could not be shown to rest on any 
rational grounds.  Falstaff would "give no man reasons on compulsion;" 
and the mind equally objects to take compulsions for reasons.  Are the 
Scottish school guilty of attempting this violence? Reid is not 
unfrequently accused of basing science on common sense, and common 
sense on blind instinct; but it is far from correct to say that this 
is his doctrine throughout his works.  Many passages undoubtedly there 
are, which naturally enough lead to the unfavourable interpretation, 
and which, if they were not counterbalanced and even retracted by 
opposite declarations, would deservedly bring his system under absolute 
condemnation.  Neglecting what cannot be approved, let us, at present, 
show Reid on his commendable side; in places, at any rate, he asserts, 
not simply <EM>necessity,</EM> but <EM>mental necessity,</EM> which 
latter is a very different thing from <EM>blind necessity.</EM></P> 

<P>In the chapter on <EM>Common Sense,</EM><sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> passages like the 
following are found to redeem the author's reputation. "The same degree 
of understanding, which makes a man capable of acting with common 
prudence in the conduct of life, makes him capable of discovering what 
is true and what is false <EM>in matters that are self-evident, and 
which he distinctly apprehends."</EM> This contrasts strongly for the 
better with Hume's doctrine, that our faculties suffice for guidance in 
practical life, but not for the acquisition of rational truth.  Reid 
continues: "All knowledge and all science must be built <EM>upon 
principles that are self-evident,</EM> and of such principles every man 
who has common sense is a competent judge, when he conceives them 
distinctly.  We ascribe to reason two offices or two degrees: the first 
is to judge of things self-evident, the second to draw conclusions 
about things that are not self-evident from those that are.  The first 
of these is the province, and the sole province, of common sense." And 
in the opening chapter of the Second Essay he had said: "Evidence is 
the ground of judgment, and when we see evidence it is impossible not 
to judge."</P> 

<P>To declare, therefore, without large qualification, that Reid 
ultimately makes intelligence an unintelligent impulse to believe, is 
an unguarded criticism, which has been written too exclusively on the 
strength of some passages that we must now consider.</P> 

<P>The grounds for misconceiving Reid are not hard to find; a specimen 
of them may be seen in Essay ii. ch. xx.  What he there calls dark and 
inscrutable is, not the act of belief itself, but the nature of this 
act -- how it is that we have faculties at all, and that they can do 
such a wonderful thing as is involved in knowing? Blind belief, and 
blindness to the mode of working in the faculties -- these are two 
vastly different things: the latter of which, not the former, is what 
Reid really wants to assert.  The process, so far as conscious, is 
intelligent: its nature considered as something, in the broad sense of 
the word, <EM>physical,</EM> is beyond the grasp of consciousness.</P> 

<P>But, unfortunately, Reid has gone too far in setting forth the 
mystery of knowledge, thereby giving to his adversaries some foundation 
for the worst charges they bring against his doctrine.  For instead of 
regarding the process as one competent to nature, he signifies that 
sensation, and its consequent idea, may have no more connexion than the 
will of the Creator that one should follow the other in definite order.  
"Whether they are connected by any necessary tie, or only conjoined in 
our constitution by the will of Heaven, we know not." No doubt this 
suggestion of occasionalism, or of the doctrine that definite 
conjunctions of created objects are merely the <EM>occasions</EM> upon 
which God acts on them in definite ways, is to be regretted; for it 
shows a readiness to take knowledge out of the sphere of natural 
causation, whereas we have good reason to regard it as a natural 
product.  Reid, however, does not allow that his teaching thus removes 
knowledge from the domain of nature, but herein he is hardly 
consistent.  We cannot more favourably take our leave of him, than when 
he is speaking so thoroughly in accord with our own doctrine as are, 
these words of his; "That there are just grounds for belief may be 
doubted by no man who is not a sceptic.  We give the name of evidence 
to whatever is a ground of belief. To believe without evidence is a 
weakness which every man is concerned to avoid.  Nor is it in a man's 
power to believe anything, longer than he thinks he has evidence.  What 
this evidence is, is more easily felt than described.  It is the 
business of the logician to explain its nature, but any man of 
understanding can judge of it, and commonly judges of it right, when 
the evidence is fairly laid before him, and his mind is free from 
prejudice."<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>Another representative of the Scotch school, Brown,<sup><small><a href="#n_c">{c}</a></small></sup> has 
expressions which some might seize upon to justify the common 
accusation that belief is made matter of blind impulse. "All belief," 
he says, "must ultimately be traced to some primary proposition, which 
we admit for the evidence contained in itself, or to speak more 
accurately, from the mere impossibility of our disbelieving it, because 
the admission is a necessary part of our intellectual constitution." 
What is here called "speaking more accurately" is at least speaking 
more ambiguously, and is open to a construction which would make the 
doctrine condemnable.  Perhaps the error is redeemed by referring the 
necessity to our <EM>"intellectual</EM> constitution:" for if the 
necessity is truly intellectual, it is not blind, but the effect of 
compelling evidence.  Still Brown's case is rendered all the more 
suspicious because he denies the principle of efficient causality; and 
asserts, for such causality as he does admit, grounds which by his use 
of the word "intuition," and by his reference of this "intuition" to 
the bounty of the Creator, are rendered very insecure.<sup><small><a href="#n_d">{d}</a></small></sup> "We believe," 
he writes, "in the uniformity of nature, not because we can demonstrate 
it to others or to ourselves, but because it is impossible for us to 
disbelieve it. The belief is in every instance an intuition, and 
intuition does not stand in need of argument." Undoubtedly real 
intuition is immediate, not reached through the medium of argument; but 
Brown's view of intuition is peculiar.</P> 

<P>If Brown is unsatisfactory, so too is Hamilton.<sup><small><a href="#n_e">{e}</a></small></sup> He teaches that 
knowledge rests on insight, belief on feeling; that the one cannot 
exist without the other; and that any definite act takes one name or 
the other from the element which is predominant.  But lie puzzles us 
when he goes on to say: "What is given as an ultimate principle of 
knowledge is given as a fact, the existence of which we must admit, but 
the reason of whose existence we cannot know." So far we might 
interpret him benignantly; but the next sentence is hard to take in 
good part." Such an admission, as it is not knowledge, must be a 
belief: and thus it is that all our knowledge is, in its root blind, a 
passive faith, in other words, a feeling." This apparent basing of the 
element of insight on the element of "blind feeling" is very misleading 
and the difficulty is increased by all that Hamilton has written about 
a belief of ours, the object of which he regards as inconceivable, 
involving not a conception, but a negation or impotence of conception, 
<EM>e.g</EM>., "the infinite is conceived only by thinking away every 
character by which the finite was conceived: we conceive it only as 
inconceivable."<sup><small><a href="#n_f">{f}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>Those who wish to see some defence of this writer may consult 
Professor Veitch's <EM>Hamilton,</EM> and Mansel's <EM>Philosophy of 
the Conditioned.</EM> The latter offers, as a key to a large part of 
the position, the following suggestions: "To conceive a thing as 
possible, we must conceive the manner in which it is possible; but we 
may believe in the fact without being able to conceive the manner.  Had 
Hamilton distinctly expressed this, he might have avoided some very 
groundless criticisms, with which be has been assailed, for maintaining 
a distinction between the provinces of conception and belief." This 
hardly accounts for such a notion as we have of the infinite being 
called a mere "impotence of thought," "the negation of a conception:" 
nor is that account fully rendered even when we have further taken into 
consideration Hamilton's doctrine, that to <EM>conceive</EM> is to 
<EM>comprehend under a class.</EM></P> 

<P>On the whole, the Scottish school cannot be acquitted of blame, yet 
are perhaps less blameworthy than some of its critics have supposed.  
What it is popularly taken to teach, but what is not exactly its 
doctrine, is the suicidal theory, that there is a practical common 
sense, which sets reason at defiance, and is rightly thus defiant.  
Pascal expresses the same opinion in his famous sentence: "Nature 
confounds the Pyrrhonists and reason the dogmatists.  Our inability to 
prove a truth is such as no dogmatism can overcome; and we have an 
apprehension of the truth such as no Pyrrhonism can overcome."</P> 

<P>(2) When it is said that not many philosophers in this country 
regard our knowledge as due to ideas communicated from above, it is to 
be remembered that the late Professor Green of Oxford, and some other 
kindred thinkers, depart from what we may call the natural tradition as 
founded by Locke, and approach nearer to Malebranche.  As a specimen, 
take the theory of Professor Green,<sup><small><a href="#n_g">{g}</a></small></sup> which it is difficult to give 
very intelligibly; but a few hints will suffice.  He describes our 
process of learning as a gradual realizing of "the universal mind" in 
the "finite mind." First there is "a spiritual activity," which 
produces nature as a system of knowable and known relations, which 
relations cannot exist except as objects of consciousness.  Then, part 
of this universal system of relations, known to the Universal 
Consciousness, also becomes known to finite intelligences, which "are 
limited modes of the worldconsciousness," in some non-pantheistic sense 
of the terms. "The source of the uniform relation between phenomena and 
the source of our knowledge of them, is one and the same.  The 
question, how it is that the order of nature answers to our conception 
of it, is answered by the recognition of the fact, that our conceptions 
of the order of nature and the relations which form that order, have a 
common spiritual source."<sup><small><a href="#n_h">{h}</a></small></sup></P> 

<P>(3) In denying to consistency the rank of the ultimate criterion of 
certitude, we must not in any way detract from its real dignity.  
Rather we ought to do our best to assert its true rank, in these days 
when system and coherence are often despaired of, and the best we can 
do is supposed to be to lay hold of a few vital ideas." It is a sign of 
the times that a prophet in America could coolly write to a prophet in 
England, as Emerson<sup><small><a href="#n_i">{i}</a></small></sup> to Carlyle, in strains so characteristic, and so 
little scandalizing to a large body of admirers: "Here I sit, and read 
and write with very little system, and as far as regards composition 
with the most fragmentary result, paragraphs incomprehensible, each 
sentence an infinitely repellent particle."<sup><small><a href="#n_j">{j}</a></small></sup> The same author records 
in his journal: "I hate preaching; it and I wish to say what I feel and 
think a proviso that to-morrow, perhaps, I shall all."<sup><small><a href="#n_k">{k}</a></small></sup> Speaking 
apologetically, he says: "It strikes me as very odd, that good and wise 
men of raising me into an object of criticism. I have always been, from 
my very incapacity of methodical writing, a chartered libertine, free 
to worship and free to rail, lucky when I could make myself understood, 
but never esteemed near enough to the institutions and mind of society, 
to deserve the notice of literature and religion.  I well know there is 
no scholar less willing and less able than myself to be a polemic. I 
could not give an account of myself if challenged. I could not possibly 
give you the arguments you so cruelly hint at, on which any doctrine of 
mine stands." <sup><small><a href="#n_l">{l}</a></small></sup> His method of composition answered to the rest of 
man.  His habit was to go out almost daily and hunt after a thought; 
then coming back to record the day's capture in a book.  So day by day 
he added to his list of stray ideas.  When the time came to deliver a 
lecture, he went to his thought-record, strung a lot together like 
beads on a thread, with little care for definite harmonious result.  
The picture of tone who so little valued consistent wholes is worth 
warning to the present generation, in which so many, despairing of the 
reduction of their ideas to unity, set little store by consistent, 
systematic thought. Provided a man is clever, bold, and outspoken, he 
may pass for a great thinker; as is the case with many a mischief-
worker like Diderot, of whom De Lamennais testifies, <EM>Il nie tout, 
croit tout, et doute de tout, au gr&eacute; de son imagination ardente et 
mobile.</EM></P>

It is notable that Emerson was one of the first to hail Walt Whitman as 
a great poet, no doubt for verses like these which are culled from 
various "poems" in Rosetti's collection for English readers:</P> 

<P>I make the poem of evil also, I commemorate that part also.<br>
I am just as much evil as good, and my nation is.<br> 
And I say there is in fact no evil;<br>
or if there is, I say it is just as important to you, to the law, or to
me as anything else.<br>
And I will show there is no imperfection in the present and can be
none in the future.<br>
What will be, will be well -- for what is, is well.<br>
The difference between sin and goodness is no delusion.<br>
Whither I walk I cannot define, but I know it is to good.<br>
The whole universe indicates that it is to good.<br>
To me there is just as much in ugliness as there is in beauty.<br>
Of criminals, to me any judge or any juror is equally criminal, -- and 
any respectable person is also -- and the President is also.</P>

<P>Some may say the context will explain all these utterances: but that 
is not a plain man's experience, who finds one of the most intelligible 
and truthful of the verses to be this:</P> 

<P>Now I perceive I have not understood anything -- not a single object 
-- and that no man can.</P> 

<P>Unfortunately, there are those other declarations to be got over, 
that obscure the little bit that seemed so obvious:</P> 

<P>As for me (lorn, stormy, even as I, amid these vehement days),<br>
I have the idea of all, and am all, and believe in all:<br>
I adopt each theory, myth, God, and demigod:<br>
I believe materialism is true, and spiritualism is true -- I reject 
no part.<br>
I see that the old accounts, Bibles, genealogies, are true without 
exception.<br>
I assert that all past days are what they should have been,<br>
And that they could nohow have been better than they were,<br>
And that to-day is what it should be.</P>

<P>One reason for insisting on the First Principles of Knowledge is to 
prevent men like Walt Whitman from becoming the poets either of the 
future or of the present.</P>

<p><A NAME="n_10">{10}</a> Hume is of some use here: "A future state is so far removed from 
our comprehension, and we have so obscure an idea of the manner in 
which we shall exist after the dissolution of the body, that all the 
reasons we can invent, however strong in themselves, and however much 
assisted by education, are never able with slow imaginations to 
surmount this difficulty, or to bestow a sufficient authority and force 
on the idea.... <i>Except those few, who upon cool relexion on the 
importance of the subject, have taken care by repeated meditation to 
imprint upon their minds the arguments for a future state,</i> there
