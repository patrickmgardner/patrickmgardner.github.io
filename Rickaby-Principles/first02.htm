<p><EM>Addenda.</EM></p><hr>

<P>1. FOR their own convenience logicians have long been accustomed to 
divide the acts of intellect into three.  The mind in viewing an object 
may be regarded either as making an affirmation or a denial about it, 
or else as not affirming or denying.  In the last case the act is 
called an <EM>Apprehension;</EM> in the first case it is called simply 
a <EM>Judgment,</EM>  when the decision is immediate, and 
<EM>Reasoning</EM> or <EM>Ratiocination,</EM> when the decision is 
mediate, a conclusion drawn from previous judgments.  Now the question 
to be raised is, to which of these acts does the complete grasp of a 
truth belong; and because between an immediate judgment and a mediate 
judgment the difference does not affect the present inquiry, the 
selection lies between <EM>Apprehension</EM> and <EM>Judgment.</EM> 
Thus the threefold division is no longer necessary: a twofold suffices.  
Throughout, however, the reference is only to human modes of knowledge, 
not to those higher modes which transcend our comparatively imperfect 
act of judgment.</P> 

<P>On the threshold, the investigation seems to be stopped by serious 
doubts which may be started, as to whether any act of apprehension is 
simply such, and not also a judgment on some point, if not precisely on 
the definite point proposed.  What is meant is, that when, for example, 
the proposition, "Quinine will benefit the patient," passes through a 
physician's mind, he may very well, for lack of evidence, leave the 
main judgment unformed; but all the same, some contend that he cannot, 
without forming upon them any judgment whatever, simply apprehend the 
two terms, "quinine" and "beneficial to the patient." Still less could 
he do this in an analytical proposition such as "The whole is greater 
than its part."</P> 

<P>We need not decide this controversy at starting, but will return to 
it presently.  Meantime we proceed thus.  Instead of the definition, 
"Apprehension is the act of the mind which neither affirms nor denies," 
we have but to substitute, " Apprehension is the act of the mind <EM>so 
far as</EM> it neither affirms nor denies, but merely places an object 
before the consciousness." Then if the distinction between apprehension 
and judgment should prove to be, not real, but only the result of a 
mental abstraction, or only a difference between a judgment of one 
order and a judgment of another order; still it would be available for 
the discussion in which it is now to be used.</P> 

<P>2. An apprehension, as above defined, cannot be false: what is 
apprehended is so far truly apprehended and cannot be otherwise.  The 
object before the mind must, of course, be the object before the mind; 
just as what a man sees, with his eyes, that he sees, even though he 
should, by a mistake in inference, proceed to name it wrongly.  But 
while apprehension enjoys this immunity from error, it has the 
countervailing disadvantage that it never fully contains a truth: and 
here is just the fact which has to be brought out.  Unless the mind has 
equivalently got as far as an affirmation or a denial, it has not 
completely possessed itself of a truth.  No man can claim the merit of 
having uttered great political truths, if he has only thrown out a 
number of terms as in apprehension, not as combined into judgments: 
"force of popular will," "resistance of the wiser few to the ignorant 
many;" "adaptability to circumstances," "fixity of principle;" 
"generous liberalism," "prudent conservatism," and so forth.  These are 
terms which might occur in any one's speech, no matter what were his 
opinions.  The case is so clear, that it is hardly needful to amplify 
the bare statement of it; though it may be useful to note that a 
student might confuse himself, if, without warning, he were to light on 
some very self-evident proposition and test the doctrine by it; thus, 
"The whole is greater than its part." But here, however inevitable and 
simultaneous the judgment may be, it is not exactly identical with the 
apprehension as limited by the definition already given.</P> 

<P>In every instance, then, to affirm or to deny, to say <EM>is</EM>  
or <EM>is not,</EM> this is the point where, and where alone, the mind 
fully commits itself to a truth or to a falsehood.  To make some 
assertion, positive or negative, <EM>there</EM> lies the risk, 
<EM>there</EM> is the success or failure, so far as truth is concerned.  
A mere apprehension is a step along the right road, but it does not 
quite reach the goal.  Hence the need of insisting on the judgment as 
the great crowning act in the order of intelligence; and of giving to 
"is" and "is not" a most prominent position in the science of logic.  
Grammarians may settle among themselves how much or how little they 
will put into their definition of a verb; but for logicians the words 
of St. Thomas must be the guide: " Intellectual truth consists in the 
equation between the mind and reality, in consequence of which the mind 
affirms that the object is that which it really is, or denies it to be 
what it really is not."<A HREF="#N_1_"><sup><small>{1}</small></sup></A></P> 

<P>3. Still it must not be pretended that in assigning to apprehension 
a definition, which shirked the real difficulty of its distinction from 
judgment, an author has fulfilled all justice.  We must solve the 
doubts already suggested.</P> 

<P>(a) There is an awkwardness, at the outset, about the definition of a 
judgment -- what precisely it is.  Of proposed definitions some obviously 
have no proper title to that name, being rather things that may be 
affirmed about propositions, than accounts of the very nature of 
propositions.  In treating the subject with a view to definition, some 
authors prefer to represent the predicate as containing the subject, 
others the subject as containing the predicate; a difference that 
amounts to one which, in pure logic, is styled that between "extension" 
and "comprehension" or "intension." In the enunciation, "Man is an 
animal", "animal" may be regarded, in extension, as a class under 
which man is included; or "man" may be regarded, in comprehension, as 
including a number of constituent notes, of which animality is one.  A 
third method is to put subject and object on a line of equality, 
instead of on a scale of subordination.  Such is the tendency of the 
following definitions taken in order from Hobbes, James Mill, and John 
S. Mill.<A HREF="#N_2_"><sup><small>{2}</small></sup></A> "In every proposition the 
thing signified is the belief, that the predicate is the name of the 
same thing of which the subject is a name:" "Predication consists 
essentially in the application of two marks to the same thing:" 
"According to the formula best adapted to express the import of a 
proposition as a portion of our theoretical knowledge, <EM>all men are 
mortal,</EM> means, that the attributes of man are all accompanied by 
the attributes of mortality;" while from another point of view the 
best formula is, "The attributes of man are evidence of, a mark of, 
mortality." The co-ordination of subject and predicate is still more 
secured by the device of Mr. F. H. Bradley,<A 
HREF="#N_3_"><sup><small>{3}</small></sup></A> who regards the simple judgment as 
containing, not two ideas, but one compound idea, which the judgment 
"refers off to the region of reality." Thus, <EM>the wolf is 
eating the lamb</EM> is interpreted as assigning over to 
reality the complex notion of <EM>wolf-eating-lamb:</EM> wolf-eating-lamb 
is a reality or fact.  This way of regarding the matter at least calls 
attention to an important truth in logic, namely, that judgment is not 
simply any mode of linking ideas together, even though there be no 
copula and nothing equivalent to it.  Nor is Mr. Bradley's view to be 
confounded with the extravagant theory of Antisthenes and others,<A 
HREF="#N_4_"><sup><small>{4}</small></sup></A> <P> to the effect that the only valid 
judgments are those in which subject and predicate are identical 
(Aristotle, <EM>Metaph.</EM>, v. 29): for he does not maintain, that in 
the proposition, "The wolf is eating the lamb," predicate and subject 
are one in the fullest sense of oneness.</P> 

<P>Evidently, if anywhere, it is especially in definitions that the 
relation between subject and predicate may be called one of 
co-ordination: "Man is a rational animal," and convertibly, "A 
rational animal is a man." In other propositions the relation may be 
changed from superordinate to subordinate, according as we read them 
either in extension or in comprehension: "man is an animal," in the 
first case is interpreted, "man is a species under the class animal;"
in the second, "man, being a rational animal, includes animality under 
his total nature." "Extension," undoubtedly, is the aspect mainly 
chosen by Aristotelian logicians, who have good reasons for their 
preference; but we need not, therefore, deny that "extension" may 
fairly be said to have its basis in "comprehension." "Extension," 
better than "comprehension," could occasionally be dispensed with; for 
it is quite intelligible, though not necessary from all aspects, to 
teach with some logicians that an abstract term, such as "rotundity," 
has no "extension," inasmuch as it is a form prescinded from all 
subjects.  On the other hand, an idea with no "comprehension" would 
scarcely be an idea at all -- a point urged against Mill's doctrine that 
proper names have no "comprehension," or, as he says, "connotation." 
Carlyle's frequent use, in the plural, of words ending in <EM>-ity,</EM> 
may furnish examples showing, how to abstract terms an "extension" may 
be given: as when we predicate of several objects that they are each 
"lugubrities," or " fantasticalities."</P> 

<P>After all, it is not the relative rank of subject and predicate, 
which is the vital point in the definition of judgment, but rather the 
copula.  It is from the copula as centre that Aristotle, and St. Thomas 
after him, frame their definitions.  According to the former,<A 
HREF="#N_5_"><sup><small>{5}</small></sup></A> "a simple proposition is the 
declaration that something is or is <EM>not;</EM>" it is "a synthesis 
of ideas, in which a truth or a falsehood is contained:" and, 
according to the latter authority,<A HREF="#N_6_"><sup><small>{6}</small></sup></A> 
"judgment is an act of intellect, whereby the mind joins or separates 
two terms through affirmation or negation." So 
defined, judgment is manifestly the act in which truth receives its 
completion, for it is in settling what are a man's <EM>affirmations 
or negations,</EM> what he says is and what he says <EM>is not,</EM> 
that we decide his correctness or error.  Unless we can reduce his 
utterances to definite propositions, we cannot pronounce him right or 
wrong.  While, however, we are thus considering the copula as specially 
decisive of the nature of judgment -- as being the determining 
<EM>form</EM> to which the two terms serve as <EM>matter</EM> may, 
under another aspect, find the relation of <EM>matter</EM> <EM>and 
form</EM> repeated in the position of subject towards predicate.<A 
HREF="#N_7_"><sup><small>{7}</small></sup></A> For at least in what are called 
normal propositions, the subject stands for the whole thing in general, 
as it is in itself, while the predicate is some special form attributed 
to it by the mind; and the truth of the judgment is the truth of the 
application of this form.  The very name "subject" signifies a 
recipiency of some determining form, not physically, but logically.<A 
HREF="#N_8_"><sup><small>{8}</small></sup></A> Thus in "aconite is poisonous," 
"aconite stands for a whole object which the speaker might simply point 
out with his finger, or with a demonstrative pronoun: "poisonous" is a 
special notion which he has about the object, and he contends, that 
this notion rightly represents a determinate character or formality in 
the object, which formality he is now distinctly contemplating, and 
wishes to affirm.  In some types of proposition this mode of 
interpretation will be less suitable, while in all the subject will be, 
not simply the thing in itself out of thought, but the thing ideally 
present in the mind of him who judges: else he could not judge at all.  
Still the point of view here indicated explains the use of the word 
"subject," and is of some assistance towards the attempt which has just 
been made, to give a definition of judgment, an attempt the result of 
which may be finally stated in the few words of Cardinal Zigliara: 
"The act whereby we affirm or deny that a thing is."<A 
HREF="#N_9_"><sup><small>{9}</small></sup></A></P> 

<P>(b) But no sooner do we congratulate ourselves on being tolerably 
free from a troublesome question, than a philologist tries to draw us 
back into our old difficulties.  It was all very well, he says, for 
Aristotle, St. Thomas, and others, who knew no language but Greek, 
Latin, and kindred tongues, to put the force of the judgment in the 
copula; but a wider range of linguistics brings the modern student 
across languages without the copula, and even without a verb strictly 
so called. As Mr. Sully urges, although our natural beliefs are 
expressed in propositional form, yet "progressing philology may show, 
that among many people confidence is really susceptible of expression 
in other than our affirmative forms of language." Nay even a melodic 
phrase on an instrument is declared, by Mr. Gurney, to be to him, in 
more than a metaphorical sense, an affirmation.  Reply is easy: all 
speech <EM>equivolcally</EM> has the copula, even though this be not 
explicitly recognized.  We ourselves, as children, once spoke with no 
conscious distinction of verb and noun: even still we occasionally 
omit the verb, or make a simple sound or gesture stand for a whole 
sentence.<A HREF="#N_10_"><sup><small>{10}</small></sup></A> Nevertheless every 
sentence, when rightly analyzed, is found to involve the sign of 
affirmation or denial. "There is," writes Max M&uuml;ller," beneath the 
diversity of human speech, that one common human nature, which makes 
the whole world kin. However different the families of language may be, 
so far as their material is concerned, let us not forget that their 
intention is always the same; and that if there are forms of thought 
common to all mankind, there must be forms of grammar too, shared in 
common by all who speak." More directly to the point is what Mr. 
Findlater writes in a note to James Mill's <EM>Analysis:<A 
HREF="#N_11_"><sup><small>{11}</small></sup></A></EM> " Logicians, in treating of 
propositions, have almost exclusive regard to Greek and Latin, and the 
literary languages of modern Europe, which are all of one type.  It 
might, therefore, be presumed that the theory thus formed would not be 
found to fit in all its parts, when applied to language of an 
altogether different structure. <EM>The mental process 
must, doubtless, be the same,</EM> but the words that express the 
several parts may be used in new and unprecedented ways." So obvious is 
this answer to a difficulty that it is scarcely necessary to insist 
further: but lest any one should be over much moved by a plausible 
objection, the further confirmation of two more witnesses shall briefly 
be cited.  These are the words of Mr. Sayce: "With all their 
differences the minds of most men are cast in the same mould.  Thought 
is one, though the forms under which it shows itself are infinitely 
various.  The unity which underlies diversity is seen in the tendency 
of all languages to assume common forms." Finally, Mr. Jevons shall 
speak: "Investigation will probably show that the rules of grammar are 
mainly founded upon traditional usage, and have little logical 
significance.  This is sufficiently proved by the wide grammatical 
differences that exist between languages <EM>though the 
logical foundations must be the same</EM>."</P> 

<P>(c) No longer for the purpose of answering difficulties, but in 
order to shed more light on an important subject, a view taken by St. 
Thomas (Ia, q. xvi. a. 2) with regard to judgment shall now be 
introduced, as eminently worth our study.  He says that though, in an 
ordinary judgment, what we primarily assert is the fact, "This man is 
white:" yet indirectly we look to our own knowledge of this truth, not 
by a new act (<EM>in actu signato</EM>) but implicitly in the very act 
itself whereby we originally judge (<EM>in actu exercito</EM>).  Each 
judgment is, as it were, accompanied with an "I know," or "as I 
perceive;" and but for this simultaneous consciousness of the 
rightness of our judgments, they would not have much intellectual 
value.  For if to the vainglorious man it can be said:</P> 

<blockquote>
<P>Your knowledge is nought, unless another knows that you know,<A 
HREF="#N_12_"><sup><small>{12}</small></sup></A></P> 
</blockquote>

<P>much more may it be said to every man,</P>

<blockquote>
<P>Your knowledge is nought unless you yourself know that you know.</P>
</blockquote>

<P>Now it is precisely this being aware that we know which 
characterizes a clear judgment, and makes it so confident, dogmatic, 
imperious.  It bears its own inner conviction with it, as an 
indispensable condition; nor is this fact to be set aside for any mere 
theory, which asserts arbitrarily that one and the same act is 
incapable of attaining to self and to not-self.  St. Thomas does not 
fall into the error which Mill lays to the charge of many 
Aristotelians, namely, that of supposing judgments to be about ideas 
instead of things: but he does insist on the important fact, which 
Mill also has noticed, that judgments are, as it were, lit up with a 
recognition of their own truth.  It is this recognition which Mill <A 
HREF="#N_13_"><sup><small>{13}</small></sup></A> has in view when he says, that 
"belief" is the characteristic mark of a judgment.  "It is 
impossible," he writes, "to separate the idea of judgment from the 
idea of the truth of a judgment; every judgment consists in judging 
something to be true.  The element of belief, instead of being an 
accident, which can be passed over in silence and admitted only by 
implication, constitutes the very difference between a judgment and any 
other intellectual act.  The very being of a judgment is something 
which is capable of being believed or disbelieved, which can be true or 
false, to which it is possible to say yes and no."</P> 

<P>The last words admirably bear out the main thesis of this chapter, 
namely, that truth is specially in the judgment; but the passage also 
implies that consciousness of the possession of a truth is part of that 
possession itself.  This consciousness, rather than the "readiness to 
act," on which Messrs. Bain and Clifford lay stress, is the mark of the 
judgment.</P> 

<P>It is gratifying to find how different schools of philosophy confirm 
the doctrine of St. Thomas; but on this point, not to be diffuse, four 
very short illustrations, two German and two English, shall be the 
limit of quotation.  Ueberweg<A HREF="#N_14_"><sup><small>{14}</small></sup></A> gives 
as the very definition of judgment the "consciousness of the objective 
validity of a subjective union of concepts:" while Bergmann teaches, 
that in judgment there is always conjoined with the apprehension of the 
object as simply existing, or as having these and those attributes, 
<EM>a critical reflexion on the truth of these attributes,</EM> 
a <EM>verdict on the correctness of the attribution.</EM> Of the 
English pair, Mill, whom we have just cited, further says: "The 
perception of truth or falsehood I apprehend to be exactly the meaning 
of an act of belief [a judgment] as distinguished from simple 
conception:" and Mr. Sully,<A HREF="#N_15_"><sup><small>{15}</small></sup></A> 
"judgment is accompanied by a belief that the objects have a relation, 
or a relation corresponding to the relation in thought."</P> 

<P>St. Thomas further supports his view by a contrast between 
intellectual judgment and mere sensitive, animal perception.  "Though 
the sense can take cognizance of its sensation, it knows not its own 
nature, and, consequently, is ignorant also of the nature of its act 
and of its proportion to the object affecting it."<A 
HREF="#N_16_"><sup><small>{16}</small></sup></A> The lower animal can never take 
account of its own perceptions, whereas man recognizes himself as 
intelligent; the lower animal never recognizes truth as such, man 
does.  Here again is a point which has so forced itself on rational 
observation, that representatives of the most widely divergent schools 
have a unanimity which, from their professed principles, might hardly 
be expected.  In proof of the fact the only available method is 
quotation, but quotation shall be short, leaving each reader to make 
fuller verification for himself.  After his own way of using words 
Lewes says, " <EM>To perceive</EM> a difference is one thing, to 
<EM>know</EM> a difference is another.  The dog distinguishes meat from 
bread without knowing that one is not the other." Less explicitly Mr. 
Sully remarks, " An intelligent dog can distinguish and recognise, but 
he cannot mentally juxtapose objects, or compare them, except perhaps 
in a very imperfect and rudimentary way." It was from a like 
persuasion that a German philosopher declared his readiness to give a 
pig the honour due to a rational creature as soon as it intelligently 
affirmed, "I am a pig:" and another philosopher, of the same country, 
promised to dismount from his horse as soon as it said, "I am a 
horse." The bacon for breakfast and the morning ride to digest it, are 
not much endangered by promises of this kind: for only a truly 
intelligent being, like man, can judge with full consciousness of the 
truth.</P> 

<P><CENTER>ADDENDA.</CENTER></P>

<P>Logicians, as it has been pointed out, can make an intelligible 
distinction between Apprehension and Judgment; but they leave over to 
psychologists a rather subtle piece of investigation as to the nicer 
discrimination of these two acts.  How this inquiry has been pursued 
may be illustrated as follows:</P> 

<P>(1) Whereas other writers largely tend to reduce Apprehension to 
Judgment, Hume would reduce Judgment to a case of Apprehension or 
Conception.<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> He regards it as "a very remarkable error," though one 
"universally received by all logicians," that the acts of the mind 
should be divided into Conception, judgment, and Reasoning.  "For, 
first, 'tis far from being true, that in every judgment we form, we 
unite two different ideas; since in that proposition, <EM>God is,</EM> 
or indeed in any other which regards existence, the idea of existence 
is no distinct idea, which we unite with the object.  Secondly, as we 
can form a proposition which contains only one idea, so we may exert 
our reason without employing more than two ideas." As an inference 
needing no middle term, "we infer a cause immediately from its effect." 
The so-called three acts are reducible to one; "they are nothing but 
particular ways of <EM>conceiving</EM> our objects." The only 
noteworthy thing is <EM>belief,</EM> "which has never yet been 
explained by any philosopher," and leaves room for the putting forth 
of an hypothesis, namely, that belief is "a lively idea related to, or 
associated with, a present impression." "'Tis only a strong and 
steady conception of any idea, and as such it approaches in some 
measure to an immediate impression."</P> 

<P>(2) Reid<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup> teaches, that in mature life a judgment goes along with 
every concrete apprehension. As regards abstract conceptions, he says 
indeed that apprehension may be exercised without either judgment or 
reasoning: but as he likewise teaches that in the perception, at least 
of sensible objects, the apprehension is derived from the analysis of 
the judgment, and not the judgment from the synthesis of mere 
apprehensions, he gives the absolute priority to judgment. "Simple 
apprehension, though it be the simplest, is not the first operation of 
the understanding; and instead of saying that the more complex 
operations of the mind are formed by compounding simple apprehensions, 
we ought to say that simple apprehensions are got by analyzing more 
complex operations."</P> 

<P>(3) If Hamilton<sup><small><a href="#n_c">{c}</a></small></sup> and Mansel<sup><small><a href="#n_d">{d}</a></small></sup> are taken next, the reason is, not 
chronological order, but the fact that Hamilton's view appears in his 
Notes to Reid, and Mansel was a disciple of Hamilton. Hamilton finds 
fault with Reid, even for that degree of admission, which the latter 
makes, when he allows that in case of abstract ideas apprehension can 
stand alone, without a Judgment. "The apprehension of a thing, or the 
notion, is only realized in the mental affirmation, that the concept 
ideally exists, and this apprehension is a judgment.  In fact all 
consciousness supposes a judgment, as all consciousness supposes a 
discrimination.  There is no consciousness without a judgment affirming 
its ideal existence." Hereupon Mansel distinguishes between 
psychological and logical judgment: "The psychological is a judgment of 
the relation between the conscious subject and the immediate object of 
consciousness; the logical is the judgment of the relation which two 
objects of thought bear to each other." Man judges psychologically 
when, as the idea "cow " passes through his mind, he simply recognizes 
the object as ideally existent -- "there is a cow;" he judges logically 
when, for the terms of his judgment, he has two distinct concepts, "a 
cow is a ruminant." "The former cannot be distinguished as true or 
false, inasmuch as the object is only thereby judged to be present at 
the moment when we are conscious of it as affecting us in a certain 
manner, and the consciousness is necessarily true.  The psychological 
judgment is coeval with the first act of consciousness, and is implied 
in every mental process, whether of intuition or thought.  It cannot, 
therefore, be called prior or posterior to any other mental operation 
in which it does not take its place." Between judgment and conception 
Mansel's most concise distinction is that the two differ "in their 
data.  In conception attributes are given to be united by thought in a 
possible object of intuition: in a judgment concepts are given to be 
united by thought in a common object."</P> 

<P>(4) To go back now in chronological order we find that Dr. Brown<sup><small><a href="#n_e">{e}</a></small></sup>
does not care much for the old traditional distinctions between 
apprehension, judgment, and reasoning: but rather insists on one great 
mental process, "relative suggestion," for putting all concepts into 
order, whether by judgment or by reasoning.  "The tendency of mind, 
which I have distinguished by the name of relative suggestion, is that 
by which, on perceiving or conceiving objects together, we are 
instantly impressed with certain feelings of their actual relation.  
These suggested feelings are feelings of a peculiar kind, and require 
therefore to be classed separately from the perceptions or conceptions 
which suggest them, but do not involve them. . . . With the 
susceptibility of relative suggestion, the faculty of judgment, as that 
term is commonly employed, may be considered as nearly synonymous." 
Another passage bearing on the same point is one in which he compares 
what he calls perception and apperception. "Simple perceptions are so 
feeble, dim, confused, and short-lived, and their objects are so 
numerous, run so into one another, come and go in such rapid 
succession, that the subject is unable to distinguish them one from 
another. . . . Perception becomes apperception by becoming more marked 
and distinct."</P> 

<P>This corresponds to a clear judgment. His reason for not using the 
more ordinary term "judgment" was given in an earlier Lecture:<sup><small><a href="#n_f">{f}</a></small></sup> 
"The term 'judgment,' in its strict philosophical sense as the 
perception of relations, is more exactly synonymous with the phrase I 
have employed (Relative Suggestion), and might have been substituted 
with safety, if the vulgar use of the term in many vague significations 
had not given some degree of indistinctness even to the philosophic use 
of it.  Intellectual states of mind I consider as all referable to two 
generic susceptibilities -- those of Simple Suggestion and Relative 
Suggestion.  Our perception or conception of one object excites, of 
itself, and without any known cause external to the mind, the 
conception of some other object, as when the sound of a friend's name 
suggests the conception of himself: in which case the conception of our 
friend, which follows the perception of his name, involves a feeling of 
any common property with the sound which excites it, and might have 
been produced by the chair on which he sat, of the book which he read 
to us, &amp;c.  This is Simple Suggestion.  There is another suggestion 
of a very different sort, which in every case involves the 
consideration, not of one phenomenon of mind, but of two or more 
phenomena, and which constitutes the feeling of agreement, 
disagreement, or relation of some sort.  All the intellectual 
successions of feeling, in these cases which constitute the perception 
of relation, differ from the results of Simple Suggestion in 
necessarily involving the consideration of more objects that 
immediately preceded them."</P> 

<P>(5) Rosmini's<sup><small><a href="#n_g">{g}</a></small></sup> doctrine rests on his view as to the impossibility 
of deriving the idea of Being from experience: but, given this idea 
innately, it is what enables us to grasp our first conceptions of 
reality, and to grasp them by way primarily of judgments.  In this 
sense he approves of Kant's doctrine, "that all our intellectual 
operations may be reduced to judgments, and the intellect generally may 
be represented as the judging faculty."</P> 

<P>(6) Lewes<sup><small><a href="#n_h">{h}</a></small></sup> takes up something very like Brown's "relative 
suggestion" when he makes "grouping" the fundamental process of 
intellect.  Each idea, as it comes up, groups itself with its likes, 
and marks itself off from its unlikes.  The copula of the judgment is 
precisely this grouping.  Every term is a judgment completed and over: 
every subject is a group of predicates.  The judgment lasts only while 
the grouping is being done: that once done, the judgment ceases to be 
and becomes a term.  Mill and Bacon agree with Lewes that a proposition 
which has ceased to convey fresh information has become merely verbal, 
or, as Lewes words it, "a mere tautology."</P> 

<P>(7) Mr. Spencer holds that nothing short of a "judgment" is an 
intelligent act; and if we take, as his description of "apprehension," 
the account which he gives of the formation of an "idea," we have the 
following account of it:<sup><small><a href="#n_i">{i}</a></small></sup> "It is because of the tendency which vivid 
feelings have severally to cohere with the faint forms of all preceding 
feelings like themselves, that there arise what we call <EM>ideas.</EM> 
A vivid feeling does not by itself constitute a unit of that aggregate 
of ideas entitled knowledge.  Nor does a single faint feeling 
constitute such a unit.  But an idea, or unit of knowledge, results 
when a vivid feeling is assimilated to, or coheres with, one or more of 
the faint feelings left by such vivid feelings previously experienced.  
From moment to moment the feelings that constitute consciousness 
segregate, each becoming fused with a whole series of others like 
itself that have gone before it: and what we call knowing each feeling 
for such and such, is our name for this act of segregation.  As with 
the feelings, so with the relations between feelings. Each relation, 
while distinguished from various concurrent relations, is assimilated 
to previously experienced relations like itself.  Thus result <EM>ideas 
of relations.</EM>  What we call knowing the object is the assimilation 
of the combined group of real feelings it excites with one or more 
preceding ideal groups, which objects of the same kind excited."<sup><small><a href="#n_j">{j}</a></small></sup> So 
much for the formation of ideas: and that these ideas are not mere 
apprehensions, exclusive of judgments, we are expressly told: "No state 
of consciousness can become an element of what we call intelligence, 
without becoming one term of a proposition which is implied if not 
expressed.  Not only when I say 'I am cold' must I use the universal 
verbal form for stating this relation, but it is impossible for me 
clearly to think that I am cold without going through some 
consciousness having this form."<sup><small><a href="#n_k">{k}</a></small></sup> Below this stage of full intelligence 
he places a continuous process of evolution, starting from mere 
unconscious nerve-shock, gradually reaching sensation, and then, in the 
same smoothly ascending course, attaining successively higher points.  
"In the lowest conceivable type of consciousness, that produced by the 
alternation of two states, there are involved the relations 
constituting the forms of all thought." In all cases perception is 
the establishment of specific relations among states of consciousness, 
and is thus distinguished from the establishment of the states of 
consciousness themselves. . . . Now the contemplation of a <EM>star 
state</EM> of consciousness, and the contemplation of the <EM>special 
relations</EM> among states of consciousness, are quite different 
mental acts -- acts which may be performed in immediate succession, but 
not together.  To know a relation is not simply to know the terms 
between which it subsists.  Though, when the relation is perceived, the 
terms are instantly perceived, and conversely, yet introspection will 
show that there is a distinct transition of thought from the terms to 
the relation, and from the relation to the terms.  While my 
consciousness is occupied with either term of a relation, I am 
distinguishing it as such and such, assimilating it to its like in past 
experience, but while my consciousness is occupied with a relation, 
that which I discriminate and class is the effect produced in me by 
transition from one term to the other."<sup><small><a href="#n_l">{l}</a></small></sup> By his whole treatment Mr. 
Spencer shows his great desire to Make it appear, how from the simplest 
to the most complicate act of mind, the process is the same-a process 
which Hobbes calls "addition and subtraction,"<sup><small><a href="#n_m">{m}</a></small></sup> and Lewes "grouping." 
The passage in which Mr. Spencer sets forth the difference between 
perceiving terms and perceiving the relations between terms is 
considered by Mr. Guthrie to be one of the most important doctrines in 
the author's system: a doctrine, however, which Brown had before 
clearly enounced.<sup><small><a href="#n_n">{n}</a></small></sup></P>

<P>(8) Under the present paragraph the reader need look for nothing 
more than a rough grouping together ,of authors who agree in the 
opinion, which may be usefully recurred to on various occasions, that 
the earliest judgments of the child are judgments in a very defective 
sense of the word.  Very different minds concur in this observation, 
and herein lies the point of interest.  Dr. Porter says, "The infant 
begins to perceive when, and so far as, it begins to attend.  The soul 
of the infant is at first in a condition of activity, in which 
sensation greatly predominates, with only the feeblest exercise of 
intelligent perception.  The infant at first feels many sensations, but 
it can scarcely be said to know objects at all; it perceives with the 
lowest activity possible of a power undeveloped by exercise." Perhaps 
it is something of the same sort which Luys, in his work on the brain, 
wishes to indicate when he writes:" Substantives play a principal part 
in the evolutions of thought and speech.  They are the primordial data 
around which the verbs and other parts of speech group themselves.  
They are the elements that underlie the combinations of human thought." 
Again, Morell, in the <EM>Outlines of Mental</EM> <EM>Philosophy,</EM> 
expresses the opinion, that "both sensation and perception are prior 
to language.  They cannot possibly be expressed in words, and conveyed 
to another.  They belong to the more primary form of our intellectual 
activity."</P> 

<P>From these non-scholastic authors we may turn to St. Thomas,<sup><small><a href="#n_o">{o}</a></small></sup> who 
speaks of two divisions of the sensitive faculty, which he calls 
<EM>sensus communis</EM> and <EM>vis cogitativa,</EM> and which, since 
he regards them as sensitive, he must conceive to be incapable of 
seizing an idea as such, reflexly and in its universality.  They judge 
of concrete single facts, and serve as guides in individual cases. Now 
to the activity of such powers would often correspond those cognitions 
which Mr. M'Cosh, in his <EM>Intuitions of the Mind,</EM> talks of as 
preceding true judgment-cognitions that are "of the vaguest and most 
valueless character, till abstraction and comparison are brought to 
bear upon them." "An infant," says Mr. Sully,<sup><small><a href="#n_p">{p}</a></small></sup> "as an intelligent 
brute, may form a few rudimentary judgments, <EM>e.g., I am going to be 
fed,</EM> without language.  There may be many implicit judgments, 
where there is no statement.  This applies to acts of perception and 
recollection.  The child's first exclamation on seeing a large object, 
big, may be said to imply the statement, <EM>that is a big object.</EM> 
Singular judgments are the first to be formed by a child, and 
constitute a very important step in the development of thought." Mr. 
Sully's view of judgment proper has already been given, and need not be 
repeated here ; but for the sake of marking an important distinction 
between sense and intellect, it must be noted that what he says about 
imperfect singular judgment, would, at least in many instances, be 
referred by the scholastics to what they call the <EM>vis 
cogitative,</EM> and so far would fall outside the question of strictly 
intellectual acts.  But even among these there must, at the beginning, 
be many mere dawnings of light, thin, vague, fleeting ideas, which just 
visit the consciousness, show a few of their connexions with other 
ideas, and then disappear.</P> 

<P>To return once more to Mr. M'Cosh.  He distinguishes "our primary 
cognitions and beliefs" from "our primary judgments," and builds the 
latter upon the former. "Every cognition furnishes the materials of a 
<EM>judgment,</EM> and a judgment possible, I do not say actual, is 
involved in every cognition.  As the relation is implied in the nature 
of the individual object, and the judgment proceeds on the knowledge of 
the nature of the object, so the two, cognition and judgment, may be 
all but simultaneous, and it may be scarcely necessary to distinguish 
them except for rigidly exact philosophical purposes."</P> 

<P>(9) According to Wundt, the content of the judgment is first given 
as an undivided whole, a whole which is not a mere bundle of associated 
ideas, but an apperceptive combination or <EM>Gesammtvorstellung.</EM> 
Judgment is the analysis of this whole, a dividing of it into parts as 
the very name <EM>urtheilen</EM> declares.  Things first enter "into 
the field of view," and then "into the point of view:" the first is 
perception, the second apperception.  The opposite theory supposes 
concepts first to exist separately, and then to be put together by 
means of judgment.</P> 

<P>(10) From the above list of opinions one obvious suggestion comes, 
that we ought not to be precipitate in drawing a very hard and fast 
line between apprehension and judgment, as between quite different acts 
of mind.  The scholastics are prepared to recognize in the two a 
certain identity of act.  If apprehension were taken, precisely on that 
side on which the intellect has to form its idea, at the suggestion of 
the sensitive image, the description of this aspect of the process, by 
the scholastics, may not seem to be allied to the description of a 
judgment.  But if we take apprehension as they speak of it, no longer 
<EM>in fieri</EM> but <EM>in facto esse,</EM> no longer in process of 
being made, but as made, then, though the distinction be only mental 
and not real, it enables us better to understand how Suarez, after St. 
Thomas, teaches that the apprehension is a sort of judgment 
(<EM>aliquale judicium</EM>).<sup><small><a href="#n_q">{q}</a></small></sup> What Mansel calls the "psychological 
judgment" answers fairly well to the opinion of Suarez.  An idea in the 
consciousness cannot be there, without affirming its presence and its 
object: it cannot rest simply in itself, as if it were a dead picture.  
It is a kind of cognition, and therefore tends to a judgment.  
Furthermore, when the mind is well stored with ideas, it is impossible 
that these should be present without in many directions asserting their 
mutual affinities; and so they stand, not as isolated concepts, but as 
more or less clearly formed judgments.  When, however, two concepts are 
called up which, either in themselves, or at any rate for us, have no 
special connexion, they may remain in the mind with no tendency to 
enter into relation as terms of our judgment.  Thus "Oxford eight" and 
"winners of the boat race" are complex terms, that may remain quite 
un-united by copula in the mind of an old oarsman, till he receives a 
telegram supplying the anxiously awaited "are" or "are not." Cases like 
this form, perhaps, the single exception to Dugald Stewart's law, that 
each mental state, as it comes up, asserts for itself a certain degree 
of credence -- a doctrine re-affirmed by De Morgan, who "takes it for 
granted that every proposition, the terms of which can convey any 
meaning at once, when brought forward, puts the hearer into some degree 
of belief".<sup><small><a href="#n_r">{r}</a></small></sup> In using these words, he can hardly have had in mind the 
extreme cases of what are called <EM>a posteriori</EM> and synthetic 
propositions, in which the connexion of subject and predicate is a most 
purely contingent fact, the mere terms having no tendency to disclose a 
mutual relation in the shape of subject and predicate.</P> 

<P>(11) Locke,<sup><small><a href="#n_s">{s}</a></small></sup> while fully agreeing with us that truth and falsehood 
are not properly in ideas, but only in propositions, yet has a peculiar 
use of the term "judgment," which calls for notice.  He says:<sup><small><a href="#n_t">{t}</a></small></sup> "The 
faculty which God has given man to supply the want of clear and certain 
knowledge, in cases where this cannot be had, is judgment, whereby the 
mind takes its ideas to agree or disagree, without perceiving a 
demonstrative evidence in the proof, but presuming it." This is using 
"judge" in the looser sense, which is obviously not the sense 
intended in the above discussion, as Locke himself would admit, who 
means by "proposition" what we have been signifying by "judgment."</P> 

<P>As we have mentioned Locke, we may take occasion from his name to 
add some of Cousin's criticisms upon him, which bear directly on the 
priority between ideas and judgments, and are much in the spirit of 
some recent publications. "It is not true that we start with simple 
ideas, from which we proceed to those which are complex.  Rather we 
begin with very complex ideas and proceed to those which are simple; 
and the process of the human mind in the acquisition of ideas is the 
inverse of that described by Locke.  Our first ideas are, without 
exception, complex, for the plain reason that all our faculties, or at 
least most of them, begin to act simultaneously. This simultaneous 
activity supplies us at one and the same time with a certain number of 
connected ideas, forming a whole.  In a word, we have, at starting, a 
multitude of ideas which come to us contained or implied in each other, 
and all our primitive ideas are complex.  A further reason for this is 
that they are particular and concrete."<sup><small><a href="#n_u">{u}</a></small></sup> Again, in the twenty-second 
lesson, he teaches that judgments are the primitive elements of 
thought, not simple ideas.  "Language, that faithful expression of 
mental development, begins with compound propositions.  A primitive 
proposition is a whole, corresponding to the natural synthesis by which 
the mind enters on the course of its development.  These primarily 
formed propositions are in no wise abstract propositions, as, for 
instance, 'There are no qualities without a subject,' but wholly 
particular, as 'I am,' 'This body exists.'"<sup><small><a href="#n_v">{v}</a></small></sup></P>
