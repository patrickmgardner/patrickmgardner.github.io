<P>OFTEN because they have expected too much from a universal criterion 
of truth, philosophers have declared that no such thing is possible.  
While some affirm that there are innumerable criteria for different 
cases, but no common criterion for all, others have gone further and 
proclaimed absolute certainty to be beyond human attainment.  The 
question is undoubtedly difficult; and yet difficulties will yield to a 
patient examination of what it is we experience when we have these 
states of certainty, which previous propositions have shown to be 
sometimes ours.</P> 

<P>I. The subject of a criterion has so many ramifications, that we 
must pick out what part precisely of the problem is to occupy our 
attention.  And first it will be well to quote the very words of some 
of the schoolmen, in which they describe the process of knowing, and 
therefore the process of acquiring certitude, as involving acts of 
<EM>conception.</EM></P> 

<P>The schoolmen, to show that knowledge is no mere subjective fact, 
insist upon its origin in us by way of a conception and birth, and of 
double parentage.<sup><small><a href="#n_1">{1}</a></small></sup> Knowledge is generated by subject and object 
together: "Whatever object we know, this in union with the cognitive 
faculty generates within us the knowledge of itself.  For knowledge is 
equally the product of both.  Hence when the mind is conscious of 
itself, it is the sole parent of its self-knowledge being at once the 
knowing and the object known."<sup><small><a href="#n_2">{2}</a></small></sup> The union of object with subject must 
be brought about "either by means of its own essence or by a similarity 
between. them."<sup><small><a href="#n_3">{3}</a></small></sup> Thus teaches St. Thomas.  In the same sense is the 
reaching of Suarez: "The cognitive power is in a state of 
indetermination as regards the production of this or the other object: 
hence to be determined to a particular act of knowledge, it needs to be 
placed in a certain relation with the object."<sup><small><a href="#n_4">{4}</a></small></sup> In the same way 
Silvester Maurus argues, that knowledge must be the joint product of 
faculty and object: as a vital, assimilative act it must be the work of 
the intellect; but for its determination to one definite similitude 
rather than to another it must be dependent on the object.</P> 

<P>This doctrine, that human knowledge results from faculty as 
determined by object would be simple enough, if the intellectual object 
could be shown always to work upon the intellect, as a luminous body 
upon the eye.  But an appeal to examples shows that the case is 
otherwise.  According to St. Thomas and the Thomists, it is truer to 
say that, the intellect illuminates its object than that the object 
illuminates the intellect; evidence does not simply pour in upon the 
mind from outer things, but the intellect has rather to furnish its own 
light of evidence.  Hence Lepidi writes: "The criterion 
<EM>whereby</EM> the mind judges is the faculty of judging; the 
criterion <EM>according to which</EM> it judges, is the rule or norm of 
truth, in other words, that inner light whereby an object becomes 
evident."<sup><small><a href="#n_5">{5}</a></small></sup> He further adds: "This light has, so to speak, two 
aspects, one, in so far as it is in the soul which it informs and 
perfects ; the other, inasmuch as it actually represents the object 
outside the mind."<sup><small><a href="#n_6">{6}</a></small></sup> The first aspect he calls <EM>subjective,</EM> 
the second <EM>objective:</EM> but what may disappoint the reader is, 
that this objective aspect seems really part of the subjective light, 
not an influence, an irradiation, a determination coming from the 
object.  If only thought could be described as the direct reaction of 
the faculty under a directly intelligible impression from the object, 
it would be satisfactory: whereas, besides its own intrinsic 
difficulties, the scholastic account of how material bodies are brought 
to bear on the determination of thought about themselves, seems to deny 
all real action of such bodies on the mind.  The problem is confessedly 
difficult,<sup><small><a href="#n_7">{7}</a></small></sup> and has been assigned, not to the logical, but to the 
psychological division of treatises in the scholastic system.</P> 

<P>Having stated there the deeper difficulty lies, we may proceed to do 
enough for the establishment of an objective criterion of truth within 
the limits of our own treatises.<sup><small><a href="#n_8">{8}</a></small></sup></p>

<P>The criterion, <EM>quo fit judicium,</EM> is clearly the intellect 
itself, and this we suppose given: but the objective criterion, 
<EM>secundum quod fit judicium,</EM> this in its ultimate and universal 
nature is what we have to investigate.</P> 

<P>Now we shall avoid the difficulties above signalized, if we take the 
problem up at a stage to which all must admit that it advances, however 
they may dispute as to the means of this advance.  All certitudes 
concern propositions, and, in last resort, propositions are to be 
decided, not by inference from others, but on their own merits.  Our 
inquiry into an ultimate objective criterion may take this shape: 
What, in last analysis, is the objective character of all those 
propositions, which, when they come before the mind for judgment, claim 
from it, for their own sake, a firm assent? This character will be the 
<EM>criterium secundum quod</EM> of which we are in search.</P> 

<P>2. It may be declared at once that <EM>evidence</EM> is the 
<EM>objective character, quality, or property which we seek:</EM> but 
since the manner of this is not obvious at once, we must have the 
courage to plunge into details.

<EM>Evidentia</EM> is the Latin word used by Cicero<sup><small><a href="#n_9">{9}</a></small></sup> for 
<b>enargeia</b>, the root of which is found also in 
<EM>argumentum</EM>, &amp;c.<sup><small><a href="#n_10">{10}</a></small></sup> The radical meaning therefore is to 
make clear, bright, distinct, conspicuous. Everything, actual or 
possible, as is proved in General Metaphysics, has its truth -- its 
ontological truth; and the manifestation, or shining forth of this, is 
called evidence.  Hence the speculation as to whether there are, 
perhaps, things-in-themselves, which have no relation whatever to any 
intelligence, is philosophically absurd.  Ontological truth is 
co-extensive with all being, and whatever makes this truth apparent to 
the mind gives its evidence.  Not all things are evident to us, or our 
ignorance would not be what it is: still several things do become to us 
immediately or mediately evident; and when we speak thus, we are using 
the word evident not in its popular use for what is easily perceptible, 
but in its technical use for what is perceptible, whether by easy or by 
difficult means.</P> 

<P>Evidence, therefore, is that character, or quality, about proposed 
truths or propositions, whereby they make themselves accepted by the 
intellect, or win assent; while the intellect is made conscious, that 
such assents are not mere subjective phenomena of its own, but concern 
facts and principles, which have a validity independent of its 
perception of them.  In saying, then, that evidence is the ultimate 
criterion, we are implying, that the criterion is not, as some have 
vainly imagined, an all-containing proposition, from which any other 
truth may be evolved; further, that is not a proposition at all, but a 
character of all propositions which so come before the mind, as rightly 
and for their own sake to demand its assent.  When the nature of this 
character has been discovered, of course it may be declared in a 
proposition, or enunciated as a principle, "Evidence is the criterion 
of truth." But the criterion in itself is not a proposition or 
principle: it is a quality found in all propositions or principles 
which we can rationally accept, for their own sake, and is the reason 
of that acceptance.</P> 

<P>3. To prove now that there is an objective evidence, which 
experience tells us to be our ultimate criterion.  It is taught in 
theology that God is the substantial truth and always knows all truth.  
He does not gradually arrive at His knowledge by the use of faculties 
determined in their activities by outer agents; eternally and immutably 
He has all knowledge, without increase or diminution.</P> 

<P>But we are beings that start with no knowledge, and gradually 
acquire our stock by passing <EM>de potentia in actum,</EM> from 
potentiality to act.  Moreover, this transition is not effected by mere 
internal evolution; the faculties must be roused and determined by 
something other than themselves.  Each faculty has it own proper 
excitant to wbich alone it is responsive.  The ear responds only to one 
generic mode of outer vibration, the eye only to another, the palate 
only to what seems to be a definite kind of chemical process. and so on 
with regard to the other senses.  Our finite intellect, in like manner, 
responds only to some appropriate character on the side of the objects 
presented to it, whatever be the way in which that presentation is 
effected.  Now this character is what we call objective evidence, 
because the term accurately describes the state of things revealed by 
the careful consideration of our own experience. Surely it is right to 
frame our theory on the analysis of experience: and what it teaches is, 
that we do not make truth, but take it, when it urges itself upon us in 
a certain way, such that we feel it to be something independent of us, 
existing before us, and giving the law imperiously to our course of 
thought.  Consider the proposition: "Nothing can arise by chance, 
everything must have a sufficient reason." In viewing the terms here, 
we feel that the relation between them forces itself upon us by way of 
objective evidence: we as distinctly feel the pressure put upon 
intelligence by some reality other than itself, as we feel on our 
bodily organs the pressure of an external weight.<sup><small><a href="#n_11">{11}</a></small></sup> Of course we may 
view the case on the subjective side, and say that it is insight which 
carries us along. True, but insight must have its obiect, and must feel 
the influence of that object. Mere subjectivism would never so 
distinctly objectivize itself, never tell us so plainly that the truth 
we contemplate is valid for all intelligence, and that to no 
intelligence can it really be manifest, as a truth for it, that events 
may happen without an adequately efficient cause.  Objective evidence 
must here lend its aid.</P> 

<P>The argument will not avail unless we recall the doctrines already 
laid down about necessary truth, and about the first condition of 
philosophizing, which is our assumed ability to reach objective truth.  
But with these doctrines in mind, we shall be forced to admit the 
fairness of the analysis, which, from an experienced act of certitude, 
disengages objective evidence as the element forming the criterion.  
Those who deny such an element, or who deny to it its right position, 
will be found denying necessary truth and violating the first condition 
of philosophy, as also asserting principles which lead directly to 
universal scepticism.  Thus they violate the implied agreement of all 
intelligent discussion, that whoever in the course of it enunciates 
principles which are the subversion of all rational disputation, should 
be thereby declared to have sufficiently refuted himself, and to be 
silenced for the future.</P> 

<P>4. The proof that objective evidence is man's criterion of truth 
gains some confirmation from a contrast with animal intelligence.  It 
is the commonly admitted opinion, that, whatever may be the process of 
animal instinct, it is not one of calculated means and ends. If the bee 
does build what is mechanically the best sort of cell, it is not 
because of perceived mathematical relations, nor because of the 
perceived fitness.  Thus the process, by its contrast with our way of 
deliberately adapting means to ends, serves to bring out more clearly 
our mode of thought, and to emphasize the criterion of objective 
evidence.</P> 

<P>5. The meaning of evidence as a criterion will be brought out into 
still greater clearness, if we run through a series of objections 
against the term and its use.</P> 

<P>(a) First, it may be said to sanction a habit of judging by mere 
appearances, on the maxim, "That is evident which to me appears to 
be,"<sup><small><a href="#n_12">{12}</a></small></sup> yet the sounder maxim is, "Trust not appearances." In answer, 
we reply that appearances always are what, under the circumstances, 
they ought to be, if we except moral deception on the part of a free 
agent; so that it is not the appearances which are false, but our 
erroneous interpretation of them.  In a sound sense we may give the 
advice, "Judge by appearances," for they are all you have got to judge 
by; and they are always the manifestation of some truth, with the 
exception just mentioned.  By evidence, however, we do not mean 
sensible manifestation alone.</P> 

<P>(b) From a charge of deceptiveness we pass to a charge of futility 
or tautology.  "Where is the use," says an opponent," of settling that 
the evident must be accepted as true? Of course it must; but the 
criterion we want is one which shall tell us, in all cases, what is 
evident." We answer that such a criterion cannot be found, or logic 
would be the sole science pointing out in every instance where truth 
lies.  The logical criterion, which takes the form of the highest 
generality, cannot discharge this office of omniscience.  Yet the 
function it does discharge is useful.  When logic says, Objective 
evidence is the criterion of truth, it does not leave the words 
unexplained: else they might convey to the bearer no more than a 
truism: but it makes them the outcome of an analysis of the act of 
certitude; and thus they receive a fulness of meaning, which redeems 
them from tautology.</P> 

<P>(c) "Be it so," rejoins our opponent; "but at any rate that is 
wholly subjective which is wholly in the mind; now truths about mere 
possibilities are wholly in the mind, and all abstract, universal 
truths formally exist only as terms of the mind.  They are truths in 
the mind, but where is the objective evidence, or outer reality to 
which mind conforms?" The only reply to the first part of this 
difficulty is got by borrowing the results of a distinct section in 
General Metaphysics; in which it is proved, that possibilities are not 
mere nothings, nor mere mental terms, but have a real foundation at 
least in the nature of the Supreme Being, and often more proximately in 
some actually created nature.  Each of them has an <EM>ens 
essentiae,</EM> though not an <EM>ens existentiae.</EM> As to the 
second part of the proposed difficulty, the reality attributable to 
abstract or universalised truths will be proved later.  That there is 
some reality in possibilities and generalized science every one must 
feel, however much he may be unable distinctly to formulate to himself 
wherein it consists.  Still the mere unformulated persuasion ought to 
induce the pure empiricist to distrust his position, which will not 
allow him to regard science as real in the laws which it lays down.</P> 

<P>6. A further difficulty stands over in the fact, that what we speak 
of under the one simple name of evidence, enters into concrete cases 
after a very complicated way, and is far from being one simple thing.  
We must distinguish different evidences.  Evidence is sometimes 
immediate, and then it presents no difficulty: but sometimes it is 
mediate, and the steps of inference may be many and intricate.  Both 
mediate and immediate evidence may be intrinsic to the case considered, 
as in the most abstruse mathematical theorem: but sometimes the 
evidence is extrinsic to the truth acquiesced in, as in the case where 
an ignorant man accepts a scientific conclusion, not from any insight 
into how it was derived, but from the evidence he has of the 
trustworthiness of his informant.</P> 

<P>Again, the way in which what we call "the evidence" for a case is 
made up of several evidences in detail, some of which tend in opposite 
directions, is instructive as to the meaning of the term.  Suppose a 
man charged with murder; the items for the defence being (a) that the 
prisoner had no discoverable motive for the crime; (b) that his 
previous conduct gave no serious indication of a character likely to be 
guilty of excessive violence: (c) that there exists another man likely 
enough <EM>a priori</EM> to have committed the crime, but quite free 
from any demonstrable connexion with it: and the items for the 
prosecution being, (a) that the prisoner, and only he, can be shown to 
have been near the spot about the time of the murder: (b) that there 
was a blood stain on his clothes: (c) that the weapon used was a 
dagger, and he possessed a weapon of that kind, which he says he parted 
with months ago.</P> 

<P>Here let us speak of the evidences, rather than the evidence.  
First, they consist of the arguments which fully prove, as we will 
suppose, the respective three statements, <EM>pro</EM> and 
<EM>con</EM>: thus we have six separate certitudes.  The difficulty 
begins when out of these we try to derive a seventh, namely, the guilt 
or the innocence of the man.  At once we get into the region of 
probabilities, the very character of which is that full evidence is 
wanting, and we are left to conjecture beyond the reach of proof.  It 
is precisely the probabilities which point to contradictory 
conclusions: the evidences, strictly so-called, cannot conflict. for so 
far as there is evidence there is truth, and no truth can gainsay 
another truth. There is some way of reconciling all apparent conflict, 
though we may not be able to find it out. Advertence to complications 
like these, while it clears up our ideas about the practical use of 
evidence, takes away all misgiving from the circiiinstance, that in 
spite of our having an infallible criterion, we are yet fallible 
judges, who blunder oftentimes.  Evidence is safe where it is 
sufficiently abundant and direct to the point: but evidence, scarce and 
indirect, may very well prove a fallacious means when employed by 
creatures such as we are.  But of this in the next chapter.  Here it 
only remains to add, in conclusion, that unsolved difficulties do not 
destroy a certitude once fully established; for probabilities disappear 
before a contrary certainty, no matter how preponderant their weight 
may have been as probabilities. If the highest probability were beyond 
all fear of a failure, it would be certainty, and riot probability.</P> 

<P>ADDENDA.</P>

<P>(I) Some schoolmen, besides the wider sense of evidence, use a 
narrower sense, according to which that only is evident, which has 
necessitating evidence, making the truth so clear that the mind cannot 
well refuse assent.  Such evidence does not exist in some instances, 
where an element of good will is requisite for arriving at the right 
conclusion.  In this sense we hear of propositions being certain, but 
not evident.</P> 

<P>(2) The schoolmen describe material objects as being in themselves 
not immediately intelligible: hence they deny that a material object 
can efficiently act on the mind; and many carry this denial even as far 
as to include under it mediate action through the sense-image in the 
brain.  Hence a long discussion about the <EM>illuminatio 
phantasmatis</EM> and the production of a <EM>species 
intelligibilis.</EM>  The matter must be left to psychology; but it so 
closely bears on the thesis about objective evidence, that to fail of 
noticing the near connexion would hardly be right.  At any rate we can 
always insist that intellect, be its object material or not, is guided 
by objective law, not by mere subjective evolution, independent of an 
object; and that the senses have a demonstrative influence on the 
objective side.  We need not, therefore, call in any mystical theory, 
such as that apparently suggested in Mr. Wylde's <EM>Physics and 
Philosophy of the Senses,</EM> where we read, that ,the whole of our 
intercourse with nature is literally the connexion of mind with mind, 
between the Great Mind and the mind of His creatures, not by miraculous 
means, but by and through the operation of those ordinary laws, of 
which He is the present and sustaining principle." lf this means only 
that God sustains and cooperates with all secondary agencies, it is 
correct; but if it implies that secondary agencies are not adequately 
operative in their own manifestation, it is erroneous.</P> 

<P>(3) The criterion is laid down for our ordinary knowledge, not for 
any supernatural or preternatural communications.  Neither does it 
concern those things which must, in part at least, be matters of 
personal taste, without an absolute objective standard, such as the 
choice between two recognized styles of architecture, of music, or of 
painting.  Preferences in these matters must be largely referable to 
subjective conditions; and the extravagance is, when a man insists on 
making his own private likings a law for others, who are just as 
competent to decide for themselves.  The misery is, that so many people, 
especially in matters of variable taste, are so insistent upon an 
invariable conformity to their favourite standard, which has no valid 
claim to be exclusive.  Because the matters are so little to be fixed 
by argument, therefore strength of assertion is called in to supply for 
proof.</P> 

<P>(4) A curious phenomenon of imagination or emotion which some seem 
to mistake for a failure of intelligence, is exhibited in cases where 
men, out of fear, will not act when reason clearly tells them it is 
safe to act.  Thus some will go to great trouble rather than step over 
a serpent, which they know to be dead; others cannot be persuaded to 
take an eel off a fish-hook, on account of its likeness to a serpent; 
and others will not go near a corpse, which they are intellectually 
convinced will do them no harm.  At least these examples do not 
diminish the rank of evidence as a criterion for assents of the mind, 
whatever they may do against man's character for reasonable 
conduct.</P>

<p><A NAME="n_8">{8}</a> What the need of this criterion is, will the more manifestly appear, 
if we look into the writings of some of those authors, who not being 
downright Kantians, are considerably under the influence of Kant's 
doctrine that we must inquire rather how objects conform themselves to 
mind, than how mind conforms itself to objects, and that there are 
<i>a priori</i> forms of mind, such as substance and accident, 
causality and dependence, which for aught we can know, may have no 
validity except as conditions of our thought. Such a doctrine is 
ruinous to objective knowledge and is too much favoured by Mansel 
(<i>Prolegomena Logica,</i> c. iii. p. 77), who tells us, that "the aws 
to which our faculties are subjected, though perhaps not absolutely 
binding on things in themselves, are binding upon our mode of 
contemplating them." When we hear such language we are prompted to seek 
an objective criterion, which at the same time shall be consistent with 
the subjective law, <i>cognitum est in cognoscente ad modum 
cognoscentis</i>.

<p><A NAME="n_9">{9}</a> <i>Academ.</i> Lib. II. c. vi. n. 17. (Nobbe's Edition.)

<p><A NAME="n_10">{10}</a> "Nihil clarius <b>enargeia</b>, ut Graeci perspicuitatem, aut 
evidentiam nos, si placet, nominemus." 

<p><A NAME="n_11">{11}</a> This is the idea which Locke, with no great success, tries to bring 
out in answer to his own question, how do men know that their ideas 
really represent the conditions of things? "Simple ideas," he replies 
"since the mind <i>can by no means make them to itself,</i> must 
necessarily be <i>the product of things operating on the mind</i> in a 
natural way, and producing therein those perceptions, which by the 
wisdom of our Maker they are ordained to." (<i>Human Understanding,</i> 
Bk. IV. c. iv. &sect; 4.) He adds that simple ideas "carry with them all the 
conformity which is intended, or which our state requires, for they 
represent to us things under <i>those appearances which they are filled 
to produce in us</i>." Words like these last convey to many readers the 
impression that Locke regarded knowledge too much after the manner of 
the passive reception of a stamp inpressed on the faculties by outer 
agents; and he is certainly unsatisfactory in what he teaches elsewhere 
in the same book. (c. ii. &sect; 14.) Here he asserts our knowledge of the 
outer physical universe to be beyond "bare probability," yet not equal 
to "intuition" and "demonstration." If he meant no more than that 
physical certitude is of a lower order than metaphysical, he would have 
been right enough: but he seems to allow the possibility that the 
former may not be a full certitude: "There can be nothing more certain 
than that the <i>idea</i> we receive from an external object <i>is in 
our minds:</i> this is intuitive knowledge. But whether there be 
anything more than barely an idea in our minds, whether we can thence 
<i>certainly infer the existence of anything without us which 
corresponds to that idea,</i> is that whereof some men think that there 
may be a question made because men may have such ideas in their minds 
when no such thing exists, no such object affects their senses."
