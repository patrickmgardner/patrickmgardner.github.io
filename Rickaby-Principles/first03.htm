<P>1. THE assured possession of truth by the intellect is called 
Certitude, which is, therefore, defined to be the state of the mind 
when it firmly assents to something, because of motives which exclude 
at least all solid, reasonable misgivings, though not necessarily all 
misgivings whatsoever.  The definition applies not only to every truth 
which is reached mediately by inference, but also to immediate 
intuitive truths, of which the motive lies simply in the self-evident 
connexion of the given terms.  Hence it is not always needful to look 
for a motive outside of the judgment itself.</P> 

<P>2. Such is a short description of what those competent to speak on 
the matter commonly understand by certitude.  It is not yet formally 
under discussion whether we mortals can arrive at such a state; though 
that we can is implied in every pretence to rational discussion of any 
sort.  Still as far as explicit declaration is concerned, just as in an 
earlier chapter it was enough to say hypothetically, that if we have 
knowledge, it will bear a resemblance to the thing known; so now it 
suffices to say, that if we have certitude, it must be as above 
defined.  Positively, however, to allow that we may, perhaps, be devoid 
of all certitude in our knowledge and that we must wait for philosophy 
to settle the doubt, this would be to cut from under our feet all  
available ground for philosophizing.  But we may omit the explicit 
assertion of a fact without allowing it to be dubious.</P> 

<P>3. Certitude is far from being our only mental condition in regard 
to things; and it becomes of the highest importance, for a well-ordered 
mind, to distinguish its several attitudes in relation to objects of 
knowledge.  Some confused intellects make no attempt to sort their own 
contents, to put like with like, and to mark off the unlike by 
contrast; neither have such minds any clear views as to what they know 
or what they do not know.  It would help them vastly, as the beginning 
of a re-organization, to note the following stages in the ascent from 
ignorance to certainty.</P> 

<P>(a) Ignorance strictly so called, is either purely negative, simple 
nescience, or else it is privative, -- want of some piece of knowledge 
which the person, all things considered, ought to possess.  A surgeon 
need not know what the "eccentric" of a steam engine is, but he ought 
to know what a "tourniquet" is. Ignorance is not as bad as error; <i>per 
accidens,</i> it may even be "bliss;" but in itself at least it 
is no good, for it is nothing.</P> 

<P>(b)Next to sheer ignorance comes doubt, which, in its widest sense, 
would include all the states intermediate between ignorance and 
certitude.  But for technical purposes, or at any rate for the 
occasion, it is convenient to narrow down the meaning of the word by 
what in itself is rather an arbitrary limitation, and need not be borne 
in mind beyond the pages wherein the limitation is explained.</P> 

<P>Mill<A HREF="#N_1_"><sup><small>{1}</small></sup></A> gives one definition of doubt 
which really belongs rather to sheer ignorance, when he describes 
doubt, "not as a state of consciousness, but the negation of a state of 
consciousness -- nothing positive, but simply the absence of belief." It 
is true the scholastics speak of a <i>dubium negativum,</i> but they 
make it more than mere ignorance; they apply the term to the state of 
the mind we are in, when a question is proposed, and the mind, simply 
for want of any valid reasons on either side, remains quite neutral.  
Thus if we are asked whether some large assembly forms an odd or an 
even number, we lean to neither side, for lack of the means of 
deciding, even with probability, one way rather than another.</P> 

<P>Now if, just for convenience, a name may be given to the perfectly 
balanced state, it can be called <i>negative doubt,</i> and comes very 
near to sheer ignorance; but is not quite sheer ignorance because at 
least the question has been intelligently entertained, and its utter 
insolubility intelligently decided.  It may be defined as the equipoise 
of the mind, due to the absence of any valid reasons on either side. 
The parallel definition of <i>positive doubt</i> is "the equipoise of 
the mind, due to the fact that the reasons on either side are equal and 
opposite." In one case the balance is due to the absence of producible 
reasons, in the other case to the presence of exactly countervailing 
reasons.  Of course it would be absurd to insist on the constant use of 
the words, under these definitions, all the more so as no exact scales 
are usually at hand wherein to weigh reasons.  Still the definitions 
are useful for the moment, while degrees between ignorance and 
certitude are being measured.  Etymologically, according to Max M&uuml;ller, 
<i>dubium</i>  expresses literally the position between two points, and 
comes from <i>duo,</i> as <i>Zweifel</i> points back to <i>zwei.</i> 
The distinctions just drawn fit in well with the etymology.</P> 

<P>(c) The first step out of doubt, when doubt is understood in the way 
above explained, may be called <i>Suspicion,</i> which is described 
as so faint an inclination to yield in one direction, that not even a 
probable assent is yielded, but there is a leaning towards a side.</P> 

<P>(d) When, however, an assent is given, but as to a mere probability, 
and therefore only under restriction, there is <i>Opinion,</i> <b>doxa</b>,
if not quite in the Platonic sense, then in the general sense of what, 
from the appearance, seems likeliest, or at all events likely.  In 
opinion, so defined, there is evidently wide room for variation between 
the limits of slender and of very substantial probability. It is a 
matter of choice whether we say that the assent is given to the 
probability of the proposition, or to the proposition as probable.  
Cardinal Newman, because of his special use of the word "assent," 
prefers the former expression.  Again, the admission must be made, that 
in ordinary speech it would be absurd to insist on the use of the words 
"doubt," "suspicion," and " opinion," in strict accordance with the 
account of them just given; and yet the account has its manifest 
utility.  It puts before the mind successive stages on the way to 
certainty, and gives to each a name.  Now plainly it belongs to logic 
not only to treat of certitude, but also to compare it with other 
states of mind, which form the constant surroundings of our group of 
assured convictions. Only the intelligences that are blessed with the 
absence of all uncertainty can afford to confine their attention to 
certainty alone.</P> 

<P>4. Much might be said of probability, but this is hardly the place 
in which to say it.  Under certain aspects its treatment is largely 
mathematical; and as, in many instances, the mathematicians guarantee 
their results only for an infinite series, it follows that for any 
practical series they do not guarantee them to be strictly accurate.  
They cannot lay down any definite limits, however large, with the 
certainty that this will secure a fair game of chance, ending in a 
balanced condition.<A HREF="#N_2_"><sup><small>{2}</small></sup></A> For the definite 
period, say one thousand years, spent in tossing heads and tails, may 
expire, just when a run of luck has fallen to one side.  Still 
insurance companies, which, if no catastrophe happens, have a kind 
of interminable existence, can manage by statistics, not only to make 
their gains compensate their losses, but also give fair dividends to 
shareholders.  For the information they require about the theory of 
chances, they look not to logicians, but to statisticians and 
mathematicians.</P> 

<P>5. This chapter ought not to conclude without a remark on the use of 
the word "belief." To believe signifies sometimes (a) to hold a thing 
as a probable opinion; and sometimes (b) to hold it as certain, 
whether (<b>a</b>) generally, without specially distinguishing the nature of 
the grounds or (<b>b</b>) specially, on the ground of the testimony of 
witnesses, or (<b>g</b>) again specially, in cases where the object 
is not immediately presented to the perceptive faculties, 
<EM>e.g.,</EM> belief in a fact as remembered.</P> 

<P>What Hamilton<A HREF="#N_3_"><sup><small>{3}</small></sup></A> says of belief may 
be usefully quoted as a help to the understanding of subsequent 
discussions in which his opinions will be involved: "Knowledge and 
belief differ not only in degree, but in kind.  Knowledge is a 
certainty founded upon insight: belief is a certainty founded upon 
feeling. The one is perspicuous and objective, the other obscure and 
subjective.  Each, however, supposes the other, and an assurance is 
said to be a knowledge or a belief, according as one element or the 
other predominates." Elsewhere he says,<A 
HREF="#N_4_"><sup><small>{4}</small></sup></A> Belief is the primary condition of 
reason, and not reason the ultimate ground of belief." When further, 
Hamilton teaches, that we believe the Infinite, yet cannot 
<EM>conceive</EM> it, or <EM>know</EM> it as possible, he does not wish 
to retract his declaration that what we <EM>believe,</EM> we must 
always, to some extent, likewise know: but he falls certainly into an 
appearance of contradiction: and beyond apology his views are at times 
misty and misleading.  Perhaps it was some participation in them which 
prompted. the line at the opening of <i>In Memoriam:</i><A 
HREF="#N_5_"><sup><small>{5}</small></sup></A>: 

<blockquote>
<EM>Believing</EM> what we cannot <EM>know</EM></P>
</blockquote>

<P>The distinction is widely received, but probably not with very 
determinate meaning; sometimes it has its very legitimate sense of 
accepting, on sufficient authority, truths which we could not establish 
on their own intrinsic evidence, and which we do not fully comprehend 
after revelation.</P> 

<P>With regard to the doubt which is often implied in the word "belief" 
it is, on religious principles, important to note, how the loss of 
dogmatic authority, and the assertion of private opinion, had much to 
do with spreading the erroneous notion that man's religious beliefs 
were but a set of opinions. Needless to say, in the Catholic Church, 
belief means <EM>absolute certainty on the supreme authority of 
God.</EM></P> 

<P><CENTER>NOTE A.</CENTER></P>

<P>	On the theory of probabilities, and as to the fact that the very 
improbable sometimes happens, the following extract is instructive: "An 
extraordinary incident in a game at whist occurred in the United 
Service Club, Calcutta, a few days ago.  The players were Mr. Justice 
Norris, Dr. Harvey, Dr. Sanders, and Dr.Reeves. Two new packs were 
opened and were traded and shuffled in the usual way. Dr. Sanders had 
one of the packs cut to him, and proceeded to deal.  He turned up the 
knave of clubs, and on sorting his hand found that he had the other 
twelve trumps.  The fact was duly recorded in writing.  The odds 
against the combination are 158,750,000,000 to one."
