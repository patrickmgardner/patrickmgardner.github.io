<P>BEFORE satisfactory advance can be made towards the next points of 
discussion, a few further remarks on the nature of judgment are quite 
indispensable.</P> 

<P>It is a controversy amongst the scholastics, <A 
HREF="#N_1_"><sup><small>{1}</small></sup></A> which, as Cardinal Zigliara thinks, 
may, perhaps, be reduced, in the end, to a difference of words,<A 
HREF="#N_2_"><sup><small>{2}</small></sup></A> whether the assent in a judgment is 
completed in the clear perception of the relation between subject and 
predicate, or whether it is not rather another act, a sort of 
intellectual nod, following upon the perceived connexion of terms.  One 
side says that the act of judging is itself a compound act, a 
compounding of predicate with subject; the other side says it is a 
simple act, a simple affirmation or negation, following upon the 
comparison of the terms. The former party are careful to insist that 
there really is affirmation and negation, and they would not be content 
with any mere linking together or fusion of ideas, or any comparison, 
short of what is required by the meaning, of the copula "is," or "is 
not." But, this asserted, they hold that no element of the judgment can 
be shown to be lacking when, in comparing the terms, the mind 
perceives, with or without additional light from outside the terms, the 
connexion between the two.  In the following pages no distinct 
superadded act of assent will be supposed, on the ground that no 
argument in support of it seems convincing.  If a man likes to confirm 
any of his judgments with a "Yes, that's it," the added act of 
approval is a new judgment, the result of reflexion on the previous 
one.</P> 

<P>Taking, then, the assent -- at least the legitimate assent -- to be 
the perceived connexion between subject and predicate, we are able to 
reject a fallacious procedure which we must briefly describe.  Those 
authors who make the assent a distinct act, following on the perceived 
connexion of the terms, occasionally manage to play some strange tricks 
in their account of a judgment, so that they can pronounce those 
propositions to be possibly doubtful which are generally reckoned 
indubitable. Thus Descartes, in behalf of his claim to be able to doubt 
certain mathematical truths, which seem indubitable, asserts, in 
explanation, his power to look away from the meaning or from the 
grounds of the proposition.  He admits that while he considers the 
meaning of the terms he cannot doubt; but he contends that he can doubt 
as soon as be ceases to consider this meaning; and it is on this most 
flimsy pr../resource that he declares these truths to form possible objects 
of doubt: "I have sufficiently explained, on several occasions, how 
this is to be understood.  As long as the mind is attending to some 
truth of which we have clear conception, it is impossible for us to 
call it into question."<A HREF="#N_3_"><sup><small>{3}</small></sup></A></P> 

<P>It must be confessed that this passage, by suggesting the case of 
wilful, precipitate, and irrationally formed judgments, suggests also a 
most obvious argument in favour of judgment being a sort of simple nod 
of the mind, and not being intrinsically constituted by a perceived 
connexion between terms.  The difficulty thus raised must stand over 
till we come to treat of the nature of error: and meantime it must 
suffice to say, that a solution is coming, and, further, that all error 
is <EM>sub specie veri</EM>; that it is because of some really 
perceived truth that the mind is able to assent at all; and that if the 
mind is carried on to add untruth to truth, or falsely to detract from 
truth, these are not strictly intellectual acts, but effects of 
obscurity in ideas, of the will, and of the force of association and 
habit. All which declarations must be expanded afterwards: at present 
it is enough to plead, that an assent worth the name cannot be wholly a 
sort of blind nod.  In words anything may be said; but an assent not 
inwardly lit up with some intellectual motives is not strictly an 
intellectual act, for it is devoid of all insight.  In a mixed act, the 
assent ceases to be intellectual at the point where insight ceases.</P> 

<P>Let the word "motive" be clearly understood.  The passage from 
ignorance to knowledge is a movement: therefore a motive power is 
required, one of the same order as the mind itself, an intelligible 
motive for an intelligent act.  So far as any assent is not thus 
motived it is not properly an act of intellect.  It is quite true that 
the intellectual faculty itself is a power to move, and the term motive 
might be used on the subjective side; but it is here regarded on its 
objective side, as an object soliciting the faculty, not as a faculty 
answering to the solicitation.  In the proposition "A straight line is 
the shortest way between two points," the motive for the assent is 
intrinsic to the terms assented to -- it is their own immediate evidence; 
in the proposition "A pistol-shot killed two recent presidents of the 
United States," the motive of belief is, with most of us, historic 
evidence, while with no one is it the intrinsic force of the two terms.  
In the one case, subject and predicate both terminate and motive the 
assent: in the other they terminate it, but do not motive.  Many 
assents, the original motives of which are all, or most of them, 
forgotten, find still an adequate motive in the clear recollection that 
they have been validly established: at any rate, motive of some sort 
they must have present, under pain of being irrational.</P> 

<P>1.The way is now clear for treating of the different <EM>kinds</EM> 
or <EM>species</EM> of certitude.  In the terminology of Aristotelian 
logic, the species is what constitutes the essence of a thing: but 
certitude, in one respect, is not an essence, but only an accident of 
the mind.  Essence, however, is an accommodating word, and allows of 
being varied in meaning according to the variability of ends in view; 
the same difference becomes essential or non-essential, specific or 
non-specific, with the change of purpose. A round biscuit, and a square 
biscuit, both of the same material, differ specifically for the 
mathematician, non-specifically for the child who eats them.  In 
general, according to the usage of human speech, that difference in any 
order is to be regarded as specific, which, in relation to that order, 
goes to the very essence or nature of the thing.  If we want a red 
object to excite a bull, then the colour, not the material, is the 
specific character: if we want a woollen garment, then the material, 
not the colour, is specific.</P> 

<P>This being so, we observe that the essential character of certitude, 
that which radically distinguishes it from other states of mind, such 
as suspicion or opinion, that which gives it its lower generic place 
under the higher genus of intellectual assents, is the firmness of the 
assent.  In other cases we either withhold assent, or give it only with 
reserve; but in certitude we are without any doubt. In the firmness of 
the assent, therefore, if anywhere, specific differences of certitude are 
to be found; for special differences here will be difference within the 
essential constituents.  In establishing three such differences we 
shall be disregarding one pet modern theory about the non-necessary 
character of all truth; but it will be better to go on our way in 
disregard of adversaries for the present, and to come back again, in 
the next chapter, to see what objectors have got to urge.</P> 

<P>(a) The highest motive of certitude, giving the highest species of 
assent, is <EM>metaphysical</EM>; which implies a necessity so absolute 
as to be bound up with the immutable nature of God Himself.  In this 
sense we may adopt, or rather adapt, the heathen saying, 
<b>anagk&ecirc; d' oude theoi machontai</b>; God cannot fight against 
the necessities of His own all-perfect Nature, and their inevitable 
consequences in regard to the possibilities of creation.  But we must 
avoid the pagan error of looking upon this necessity as something 
extrinsic to God, a fate or destiny having an independent existence. 
The prime metaphysical necessities are that God should exist as the one 
absolutely necessary Being; that He should be just what He is, and that 
from the nature of this First Being should follow the laws regulating 
the possibilities of all that can be created, and of all finite truths.  
This is the matter of a whole section in the scholastic treatise on 
General Metaphysics.  Here it must suffice to give a few specimens of 
truths metaphysically necessary; to which the ordinary mind, unbiased 
by philosophic theory, will feel no difficulty in allowing a most 
absolute, irreversible character. "God cannot lie;" "Moral right is 
sacred;" "Nothing can at once, under the same aspect, be and not be;" 
"Every new reality or event must have a cause;" "Two straight lines 
cannot enclose a space." These examples at least give a clue to what is 
meant by the species of truth called metaphysical.</P> 

<P>(b)Strongly contrasted with absolute necessity is <EM>physical</EM> 
necessity, which we call contingency.  The physical (<b>phusein</b>) is what 
comes into being, what has an origin and a growth, what is produced or 
made; and so it differs from the metaphysical, which simply and 
eternally is.  Hence the term physical, as here understood, does not 
apply to the order of mere possibilities.<A 
HREF="#N_4_"><sup><small>{4}</small></sup></A> The physical is the actually created 
order of real existence, which existence is contingent, and might never 
have been.  As a fact, out of the various worlds which in His 
Omnipotence God might have created, He has created the existent 
universe; whereas He might have created another, or might have 
abstained from creating altogether.  Even the present system is not so 
rigorously settled that He cannot miraculously interfere with the 
ordinary sequence of effects.  Thus the physical necessity, to which we 
have to bow, is not <EM>a priori</EM> and immutable, but <EM>a 
posteriori</EM> and mutable by Divine power.  It is, however, <i>a 
priori</i> to this extent, that all its possibilities were fixed <i>a 
priori,</i>  and to an intellect able to look into the very 
constitution of bodies, all their powers would presumably be thence 
deducible; while from the primitive collocation of world-elements, all 
subsequent phenomena, apart from what is due to the interference of 
free will, might be calculated.  We, however, who can neither 
adequately penetrate the inmost nature of matter, nor quite solve even 
the comparitively simple problem of three attracting bodies, have to 
proceed on a humbler method: so for us physical truths are <i>a 
posteriori,</i> and are ultimate facts, which we take on the evidence 
of experience, without being able to give their final account.  All our 
physical explanations end in mere empirical facts.</P> 

<P>(c)The third kind of motive for certitude need not detain us long; 
for we shall have to give a separate consideration to historic 
evidence, and then the nature of <i>moral</i> truth, as it is styled, 
will appear in a fuller light.  We have, in this matter, the difficult 
problem to find a sort of necessity, in spite of free will being mixed 
up with the elements of our calculation.  We shall have to claim, that 
occasionally we can know how people have used, or will use, their power 
to choose under given circumstances. Thus moral truth, in the sense at 
present given to it, is truth about human action, which in many 
details is free, though it has not a freedom unbounded.  The theoretic 
difficulties against the possibility of ever calculating human conduct 
on the hypothesis of a real liberty of choice, vanish at once before a 
concrete case; it is a sheer impossibility that historians should be 
deceiving us, when they narrate certain substantial events in the lives 
of Alexander the Great, Julius Caesar, and Charlemagne.  Again, there 
are cases where we may be certain, that a very well tried character 
will not prove treacherous under moderate temptation and enormous 
responsibility. These instances convey sufficiently what is to be 
understood by the third species of certitude, which is here styled 
moral.</P> 

<P>It must be added, however, that the same phrase, "moral certitude," 
which is here used for strict certitude, is employed also in a looser 
way to mean high probability, such as would be enough to determine the 
action of an ordinarily prudent man.  It is moral inasmuch as it 
suffices for a moral agent.  Thus a merchant would make a great venture 
on "a moral certitude," which meant the probability of a thousand to 
one, yet did not quite leave the level of probability, and mount into 
that of strict certitude.</P> 

<P>While it belongs to philosophy to draw, in general, the distinction 
between the three species of certitude, it would be preposterous to ask 
it to settle, in all concrete cases, whether we can have certitude, and 
if so, of what kind.  Not all the departments of science together can 
discharge this function: but each department is left by philosophy to 
do what it can in its own sphere, while philosophy itself investigates 
certitude in its highest generality.  Should any one try to illustrate 
its doctrines by examples confessedly dubious in their own scientific 
order, it simply begs the person to choose a more suitable 
illustration; it does not undertake to meddle out of its own province, 
and it borrows, to exemplify its teaching, only safe instances.</P> 

<P>2. Next to difference of kind in certitude may be taken difference 
of degree.  It is maintained by some that from its very nature 
certitude admits of no degrees, of no less and more; that if a man is 
sure, he is sure, and that is all about it; so that to talk of 
assurance being made doubly sure is a mere <i>fa&ccedil;on de parler</i>. 
We are not concerned to maintain that under no acceptation of the word 
"assent" is it possible to deny the existence of degrees in it; but 
if we take "assent" in its wider and more ordinary meaning, the 
certitude of our assent does admit of degrees, in the sense we are 
about to explain in the following paragraph.</P> 

<P>Every certitude must absolutely exclude all solid doubt, which 
exclusion of doubt is the negative side of certitude and, of its own 
nature, allows of no degrees; but the positive side, or the positive 
assent itself, is of a nature to admit degrees.  Certitude, then, on 
its <i>negative</i> side has not, on its <i>positive</i> it has, 
degrees.  The two sides are only distinguishable aspects, not separable 
elements; by one act, we are sure and do not doubt. Before this 
doctrine can appear quite satisfactory, it needs a little elaboration.  
For against it, in its cruder form, must be urged the fact, that 
the same motives which produce assent also drive out doubt; and that, 
therefore, doubt is expelled with a force varying with the expelling 
motives, all of which are alike in that they annihilate doubt, but 
differ in that some effect the annihilation with greater energy.  So of 
two men who agree in the fact of being no longer in a certain assembly 
room, one may have been quietly lifted into the adjoining street, and 
another shot with a catapult into a street some distance away.  Thus, 
it is argued, even the negative side of certitude, the expulsion of 
all doubt, may differ in degree.</P> 

<P>To answer the objection we must limit the meaning of expelled doubt.  
We must take the absence of doubt purely on its negative side, or on 
its side of nonentity; then nonentity, as such, is unsusceptible of 
less and more.  Of course mathematicians, with whom, however, positive 
and negative often mean no more than one direction and its opposite, 
extend negative quantities as far backward as positive quantities go 
forward: to the <i>plus</i> series 1, 2, 3, 4, &c., they can oppose a 
<i>minus</i> series 1, 2, 3, 4. Still it will be only by positive 
considerations that degrees are estimated in the negative direction.  
For example, a man who is said mathematically to be <i>minus</i> 
&pound;1,000, interpreted to have no money, and, worse than that, to be under 
obligation to give the first available &pound;1,000 he gets to his creditors.  
Here the negative, as a negative, is the fact of a man having no money: 
beyond that the degree of his indebtedness must be calculated on 
positive grounds.  The case is not quite parallel with the one in hand; 
but it sheds upon it some light, by helping to show how a negative, as 
a nonentity, cannot be greater or less.  A negation in the sense of an 
intellectual denial may be given with greater or less intensity; but a 
negation in the sense of the mere non-existence of a doubt has no 
varying intensity.  And so the whole statement, that certainty, on its 
negative side, has no degrees, is reduced to saying, that the 
non-existence of doubt in every certitude is a simple non-existence, or 
nothing; and that nothing does not admit of more and less.</P> 

<P>The way is thus cleared for establishing the possibility of degrees 
on the positive side of certitude. What a man <i>does</i> is one thing, 
what in strict logic <i>he ought to do</i> is another; and speaking 
from the former point of view only, it is not incumbent on us to prove 
that every man <i>does</i> always regulate the degree of his assent 
according to the considerations now to be brought forward.  Cardinal 
Newman ably maintains that as a fact man does not so proportion his 
assents; it is enough for us that the considerations we have been 
urging are such that, of their own nature and <i>caeteris paribus</i> 
they produce the effect of varying the force of intellectual adherence.  
Those who, like Dr. Gutberlet, start from the notion that certitudes 
are equations<A HREF="#N_5_"><sup><small>{5}</small></sup></A> and argue that however 
the terms equated may vary, yet equation itself is constant, plainly 
leave out of the question elements which claim to be noticed.</P> 

<P>St. Thomas, while he allows to the objection derivable from this 
idea of knowledge as an equation, the truth it contains, still manages 
to take out of the difficulty all its force as an objection, Not, 
indeed, that he is designedly combating the adverse view: his words 
form only the better answer to the difficulty, because they meet it 
unintentionally and in the mere act of explaining the real position of 
assent.  What he says is this: "According as a thing happens to have 
more truth in it, it elicits a higher belief. For while truth consists 
of an equation between intellect and object, if we regard truth merely 
as an equation, it does not allow of less or more: but if we consider 
the very Being of the object, and remember that truth has its ground in 
the Being, and that such as the Being is, such is the truth; then those 
things which have more of Being have also more of truth."<A 
HREF="#N_6_"><sup><small>{6}</small></sup></A> That is, if you regard truth as a mere 
equation between a mental act and its formal object, equality is 
equality all the world over, whether the terms equated be greater or 
less.  But intellectual assent is no mere dead uniform sign of 
equality, like our algebraic symbol: it is a living response to 
objective evidence, and is apt to vary, <i>caeteris paribus,</i> with 
the evidence that calls it forth. Hence St. Thomas again affirms: "An 
assent is nothing but the determination of the intellect to one 
affirmative: and by so much greater is the certitude by how much 
stronger is the motive by which it is determined."</P> 

<P>Arguing first of all on the line here suggested, we may hope soon to 
find force of demonstration enough to overpower the hostile statement 
of Mr. Lewes: "The widest of all axioms, whatever is, is, cannot be more 
certain, more irresistible, than the most fleeting, particular truth." 
Against this let us try three arguments.</P> 

<P>(a) Whilst certitude always remains up to the level of certitude, 
and never sinks to the lower grade of strong probability, still its 
accidental degree may vary: it reasonably so varies when the truth 
proposed is of a higher order.  Thus a man is certain that he lit his 
fire with one of Bryant and May's matches: he is, or may be, certain in 
a more intense degree that the fire would not have blazed up without an 
igniting cause of some sort.  He is certain that Victoria in 1887, the 
Jubilee year, was Queen of England: he is, or may be, certain in a more 
intense degree that God is sovereign Lord of all.  He is certain that 
he paid a bill for four shillings with two florins: he is, or may be, 
certain in a more intense degree that two and two make four.  Where an 
adequate cause for intenser degree is assigned, and where we have a 
faculty susceptible of stronger and weaker excitation, it is fair to 
infer a possible variation in the effects.  To say that the variation is 
something outside the rational assent, or that it belongs only to 
concomitant emotion, is to ignore explained facts.  It is quite true 
that some degrees of intensity are emotional; as when an Englishman 
assents more keenly to the authentic news of a victory for the British 
arms, than to the equally authentic news of a victory gained by one 
savage tribe over another.  But the possibility of degrees in the 
region of emotion does not exclude their possibility in another.  It 
was in intellectual motives that a cause for intenser assent was above 
pointed out; and therefore it is in intellectual assent that the 
intenser degree may sometimes reside which is all we had to show.</P> 

<P>(b) A second argument may be put thus: Always supposing true 
certitude, sometimes we assent as under compulsion, and perhaps 
against our wish to believe otherwise: sometimes we assent, with ease 
indeed, but not with the feeling of strong compulsion; sometimes we 
assent but not without a certain effort of the will, urging on the mind 
to put carefully together and admit the just sufficient evidences.  
Against saying universally that these represent three descending grades 
of assent stands the fact, that the firmest of all assents, the act of 
supernatural faith, results from a command of the will; but keeping 
within the natural order, and speaking of general cases, we may assert 
of the above, that they are three varying grades, the variation being 
precisely in the intellectual character of the acts.</P> 

<P>(c) Again, if the simple argument, "Certitude is certitude all the 
world over," were decisive of the whole question, it might be 
questioned whether Divine and Angelic intelligence were to be regarded 
as following under the rule.  But waiving these points and keeping 
strictly to human intelligence, just as we drew a proof from the 
varying force of objective truths, so we may draw a proof from the 
varying force of human minds; some men, because of their keener 
faculties, may give an intenser assent to the same argument which 
draws likewise the assent of their duller brethren.  And so 
once more, a certitude can vary in degree.</P> 

<P><CENTER><STRONG>ADDENDA.</STRONG></CENTER></P>

<P>(1) In distinguishing three kinds of certitude it is worth while to 
notice their interdependence.  Though some physical conditions of brain 
must be fulfilled in order that the mind may understand a metaphysical 
truth, yet man may claim, in regard to metaphysical truths, that he 
can obtain them without the admixture of truths of a different order.  
The principle of contradiction is reached in its purely metaphysical 
character.  But all physical truth must be inseparably bound up with 
some metaphysical principles; for example with the just-mentioned 
principle of contradiction.  For where would be the use of discovering 
that a planet exists, if there were no guarantee that its existence was 
incompatible with its non-existence.  Obviously the metaphysical 
principle is not applied after the physically ascertained fact, but 
enters indissolubly into union with such ascertainment, which else 
would be impossible.  In the third place moral truth must have joined 
with it, not only metaphysical, but also physical truths: for we 
judge human conduct through physical manifestations; and human speech 
or writing is equally a physical phenomenon.</P> 

<P>(2) It has been asserted that the intenser degree is never in the 
certitude as such, but in some concomitant emotion.  Thus a writer in 
<i>Mind</i>, who betrays the fact that he has not cleared up his own 
thoughts on the subject, ventures on the declaration, that "there are 
no degrees of intensity in cognition: the intensity is a matter of 
feeling concomitant with the cognition."</P> 

<P>The relation between what are called feeling and cognition forms a 
matter of much vague discussion.<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> Some place the foundation of 
feeling in cognition, on a wide extension of the principle, "There is 
neither desire nor fear of the unknown;" others reverse the position, 
and make blind feeling primitive -- pure subjective feeling without an 
object.  Feeling again is made to include all consciousness; so that a 
stronger intellectual assent, making itself felt in consciousness, 
could be put down to feeling.</P> 

<P>In face of such ill-defined terms in the objection, it is enough to 
reply, that if, from an examination of any case, it appears that one 
assent has no <i>intellectual</i> motive or cause stronger than 
another, then it is no illustration of our thesis; but if a distinctly 
intellectual ground of superiority can be shown, then it is an 
illustration.  If exactly the same vouchers tell a man of the equally 
credible events that a friend and a stranger have both perished in a 
shipwreck, then the intenser act in regard to the friend's death may be 
put down to emotion.  There may also be something intenser in the 
intellectual energy, but this element would be difficult to detect and 
estimate.</P> 

<P>And generally we may say, that people are too apt to think that they 
can mark off, with nicety, assent from assent, affective movement from 
affective movement, and the former of the two elements from the latter.  
Whereas clearly to isolate an act in reflexion, is often most difficult 
or impossible. It may very well be that, not acting on the possible 
principles explained in the argument which we used to prove the greater 
force of a metaphysical over a physical truth, a schoolboy will 
concentrate even a greater intellectual energy on the very contingent 
fact that he, a poor player usually, has had the luck once to score 
fifty at a cricket match, than on the eternally abiding, necessary 
truth that two straight lines cannot enclose a space.  But in a 
concrete case of this kind, who is to disengage the intellectual from 
the emotional elements? Again, the mere size, or amplitude of the 
object assented to may easily get confused with a notion that the 
assent itself is intenser; and who then is neatly to discriminate 
extension from intensity? Take once more the rule sometimes laid down, 
that in any given case feeling and intelligence are in inverse ratio; 
the heavier drain in one direction exhausting the supply in the other.  
There is some truth expressed in such a rule; but on the other hand, 
the force of an emotion is sometimes to increase the intellectual 
power, not to diminish it, as in those who speak best under a fairly 
strong excitement.  Let us not, then, be deceived by a fancied 
simplicity, but rather apply to acts of the human soul what a French 
writer, quoted by Sir H. Maine, says of human society: "I have hitherto 
discovered but one principle which is so simple as to appear childish, 
and which I scarce dare to express; it is no other than the 
observation, that a human society, a modern society especially, is an 
immense and complicated object."<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup></P>
