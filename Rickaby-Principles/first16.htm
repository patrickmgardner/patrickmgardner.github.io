<P>(A) It is admitted with tolerable unanimity that the acquisition of 
knowledge is a procesf, beginning with the senses; and, therefore, with 
an examination of their testimony we must start our critical 
nvestigation of certitude in detail.  During the performance of this 
task it will be made apparent, how much we need the ideas of substance 
and efficient causality, and how little we could do, if we were to 
accept Professor Clifford's dictum, that "the word <EM>cause</EM> has 
no legitimate place in the science of philosophy; "or the saying of 
Reid, that "for anything we can prove to the contrary, the connexion 
between impression and sensation may be arbitrary," and that "causes 
have no proper efficiency as far as we know; "or lastly, the words of 
Professor Green,"<A HREF="#N_1_"><sup><small>{1}</small></sup></A> The greatest writer 
must fall into confusion when he brings under the conceptions of 
<EM>cause</EM> and <EM>substance</EM> the self-conscious thought which 
is their source; when, in Kantian language, he brings the source of the 
categories under the categories": for "the mind is not 
<EM>substance,</EM> but <EM>subject,"</EM> in which "tersely put 
formula Hegel emphasizes his position towards the ordinary 
metaphysics." Such doctrines are absolutely fatal to the claim that man 
can gain real knowledge through the media of his senses.</P> 

<P>1. The philosophical discussion of the validity of the senses may be 
aptly prefaced by a statement as to what is the way, and the highly 
reasonable way, in which ordinary people, through their senses, come to 
the recognition of an external world of matter, distinct from their own 
bodies.  Apart from all philosophy, it is a commonly admitted truth --
which the idealist also allows when he is not idealizing, and still 
allows when he is idealizing, but in his own perverse way -- that each 
man has a body with a set of separate bodily senses attached; and that 
thus constituted the individual is placed in a world made up of things, 
which also are bodies.  From earliest infancy, all through the long 
ceaseless course of education, which the senses have to undergo before 
they become fitting instruments of perception, and thenceforth 
continuously up to the end of healthy existence, man is ever receiving 
experiences which go to enforce the conclusion, that there is a thing 
which is his own body, and that, distinct from this, there are other 
bodies.  Constant action and reaction between organism and environment, 
as also between different parts of the organism itself, serve to 
impress this conviction.  Daily more and more is the reason satisfied 
that it is rightly interpreting the situation.  It may be that no 
deliberate, explicitly designed line of argument is gone through: or 
that if such argument be explicitly attempted, it seems a failure, only 
obscuring what before was clear.  This fact leads a number of writers 
to say, not accurately, that belief in an external world is not a 
rational process, that reason destroys natural conviction, and that 
only instinct is to be trusted.  It is more satisfactory as a theory, 
and more in accordance with the truth of facts, to hold that while no 
mere verbal argument can contain the full cogency of proof, which is 
found in a life spent literally in knocking about the world and in 
being knocked about by it -- a life of thumps and bumps against hard 
matter; yet the argument is capable of verbal expression, in a form 
which meets the requirement of demonstration.  The verbal form is not 
as forcible as the accumulated experience, but it is argumentatively 
valid, especially as it is addressed to those who have the experience.  
From the first tumbles of a child learning to walk, up to the last 
stumbles of an old man tottering at the verge of his grave, there is, 
first of all, strong non-philosophical proof that there is solid matter 
in and out of the human frame.  Afterwards the nonphilosophical proof 
can take philosophic shape: in which transformation philosophy has 
nothing to rely upon except its power to give systematic shape to 
nature's spontaneous interpretation of experience.</P> 

<P>2. That the common, spontaneous belief of mankind is what it is, 
affords strong presumption that it is right.  Clifford, indeed, tries 
to cast doubt on the fact that the popular belief in an outer world is 
such as we assume it to be, but herein he is certainly wrong.  So is 
Mill when he declares that apart from philosophic and theologic bias, 
his view contains all that mankind really believe.  In point of fact 
the common persuasion is, that we have each a material organism, 
brought into varied contact with distinctly other matter: and in making 
this interpretation of the case the common voice, as we now wish to 
argue, is likely to be correct.  For the belief concerns not abstruse, 
remote speculations, but one of the most fundamental, indispensable 
notions about the constitution of self-conscious human nature and of 
its surroundings.  Assuredly the presumption is, that the easy, ready, 
and universal account rendered by our intelligent nature of itself, is 
better than the strained effort after theory, which, perhaps, its very 
advocates do not practically believe.  Even Fichte himself confessed, 
that while idealism was, as he fancied, demonstrable, yet it would 
never be believed.</P> 

<P>3. However, we must go beyond presumptions in favour of our thesis, 
and set about the solid business of proof; for which the way must first 
be prepared by a few divisions and distinctions, that throw light on 
the whole matter in hand.</P> 

<P>We may leave alone the division of the senses into inner and outer, 
which raises the controversy whether the seat of all sensation alike is 
the brain, or whether the outer organs are likewise seats of sensation.  
Nevertheless, as we are going to treat principally of what are called 
"the outer senses," we shall do well to frame some answer to the 
question, How many these are, and how far has the old account of them 
been upset by modern physiology?</P> 

<P>(a) To the traditional five senses modern writers make additions by 
splitting up what used to be comprised under the one faculty of 
<EM>Touch</EM> into several senses.  The resulting new terms have now 
grown pretty familiar to a reading public that must have been 
sufficiently often brought across such phrases as "the muscular, 
sense," and "the sensations of organic life." It has heard also of 
special nerves, or special conditions of nerve, for perceiving heat: 
it knows of such curious facts as are implied in analgesia, or 
insensibility to pain, while there is no accompanying anaesthesia or 
insensibility to touch. A patient has seen the lancet approach the 
flesh, has felt the incision, and has wondered at the absence of 
suffering.  Rarely there seems to be anaesthesia without analgesia.  
These facts are worth knowing; and any one who, treating of the 
validity of the senses, utterly ignored such discoveries might be 
suspected of incompetency.  But really, on careful consideration it 
will appear, that with the exception of the stress laid on what is 
called the muscular sense for coming to the knowledge of resistance, of 
externality, of magnitude, and the like, few of the new ideas enter 
much into the present dispute.  How for instance does it affect our 
problem, to be told that the rate of propagation in the nerve stimulus 
is rather slow, and that, on a rough estimate, while stimulus increases 
in geometric progression, sensibility increases only in arithmetic? 
For our business, then, it is enough to have examined what is the style 
of modern discoveries with regard to the outer senses, in order to 
assure ourselves that these discoveries offer no obstacle to the 
arguments we are about to use, and then to decide that the old division 
into five senses will satisfy our requirements well enough, if we only 
remember that the division is not very precise.  But the general fact 
itself, that there are different senses is a consideration of some 
weight in our problem; because it raises, for example, such questions 
as, how can these diverse senses be all true reporters, which report so 
differently of the same object?</P> 

<P>(b) Next to the division of the senses comes a call for a division 
of the objects of sense; to meet which demand, obviously one way would 
be to let the first division settle the second.  But there is another 
division which suggests itself to nearly every investigator, and is 
often introduced into the controversy upon which we are preparing to 
enter.  For the distinction readily occurs, according to which some 
sensations are specially referred to the object felt, others specially 
to the subject feeling, and others not specially to either.  The size 
of an apple, its taste, and the combined feeling of pressure and 
resistance to which it gives rise when the hand is placed upon it, are 
instances respectively of the three modes of sensitive experience.</P> 

<P>Let us go back to Aristotle,<A HREF="#N_2_"><sup><small>{2}</small></sup></A> who 
distinguished with pretty much the same result as the above, those 
sensibles which can be reached by more than one sense -- <b>ta koina 
aisth&ecirc;ta</b> -- and those which can be reached by only one sense 
-- <b>ta idia aisth&ecirc;ta</b>. St. Thomas<A 
HREF="#N_3_"><sup><small>{3}</small></sup></A> calls the former <EM>sensibilia 
communia</EM> and the latter <EM>sensibilia propria.</EM> Thus, at 
least, in the educated condition of the senses, superficial extension 
is perceptible both to sight and touch, and is regarded as specially 
objective; colour, sound, odour, are each perceptible only by one 
sense, and are regarded as specially subjective.  St. Thomas adds a 
third class, the "Things which fall accidentally under the senses, as 
when this Coloured object happens moreover to be a man."<A 
HREF="#N_4_"><sup><small>{4}</small></sup></A> Aristotle's parallel instance is seeing 
the son of Cleon.  We see an object of definite colour, light and 
shade, outline; we know this to be a man, and even to be the son of a 
certain father: but these latter facts are not at the moment immediate 
objects of our sight; they are known <EM>aliunde.</EM> The 
corresponding classification in favour among English philosophers is 
that according to primary and secondary qualities; or as Hamilton puts 
it, into primary, secondary, and secundo-primary.  He enters into great 
minutiae, hit we need not follow him.  It is enough to have called 
attention to the fact, that whereas sensation includes an objective and 
a subjective side, sometimes our attention is called predominantly to 
the one, sometimes to the other, and sometimes neither side seems to 
predominate.</P> 

<P>(c) Hamilton again distinguishes between sensation and perception.  
Those who push this distinction to the uttermost, describe sensation 
itself as mere subjective feeling, with no object to which it points, 
or as not a cognitive act.<A HREF="#N_5_"><sup><small>{5}</small></sup></A> <P> They 
make all perception a separate act, supervening on sensation; and they 
make it the business of the mind to trace this subjective state to some 
outer cause, almost as we might interpret the meaning of a foot-print 
in the sand, saying that it is the mark of an extinct animal.  Reid 
only too manifestly tends to this extreme view and is therefore 
reprehended by Hamilton.  He even goes further and almost leaves the 
work of assigning the objective origin of sensation in the hands of the 
Creator.  Regarding the perception as an act only of the mind, Reid 
connects it with the sensation as with a mere antecedent, which may 
have no closer tie with the perception than the will of God, who has 
settled that, in fact, after a bodily impression, a mental expression 
shall follow.</P> 

<P>It pertains to psychology to treat this matter, but we may state a 
few leading heads of doctrine.  First of all, sensation itself is 
something neither purely mental, nor purely material.  It belongs, as 
Hamilton says, to the animated organism, or to united soul and body; 
the proof of its compound nature being apparent in the felt phenomena, 
which are partly of a spiritual partly of a bodily character.  This 
composite character of our sensations is of great importance in 
accounting for our notion of Space, which pure empiricists vainly seek 
to derive from non-spatial feelings, while the <EM>a priori</EM> 
school make it a subjective form of our faculty, which they call 
objective because all men alike have this form.  As to whether, besides 
sensation, there is such a thing as sensitive perception, the condition 
of the lower animals, is an argument that there is.  The Duke of Argyll 
appeals to our own experience in the matter as very convincing: but, 
while it is true that we have sense-perceptions, it is also true that 
we cannot begin reflectively to analyze them except in terms of 
intellectual perception.  What is called the sense-perception of an 
object is often really the intellectual perception consequent on the 
sense perception.</P> 

<P>(B) Now what, in the coming argument, we must chiefly have regard 
to, is precisely the intellectual perception and judgment about objects 
of which we are made cognisant through the medium of the senses.  When 
intellectually we judge that there is an outer material world, having 
really such and such properties, then we have the act which this 
chapter is concerned to prove generically valid.  We do not suppose 
outer objects immediately setting a seal upon the spiritual mind: and 
Ferrier is quite misconceiving our problem, when under the wrong notion 
just repudiated, he declares, "Descartes saw that things and the 
senses could no more transmit cognitions to the mind than a man can 
transmit to a beggar a guinea which he has not got."<A 
HREF="#N_6_"><sup><small>{6}</small></sup></A> We, too, see and confess as much: but 
what we deem still worthy to be examined into is, whether the intellect 
can arrive at judgments about the external world, because this world 
first acts on an animated organism adapted to feel and sensitively to 
perceive it; and because, on the occurrence of the sensitive 
perception, the intellect, which is only another activity of the same 
soul that takes part in the sensation, is adapted to form to itself 
ideas corresponding to the obects which excite its sensibility.  
Undoubtedly it is a very obscure point how the transition is made from 
sense to intellect; but, as we have to repeat so often, a fact may 
become apparent while its mode remains undiscoverable.  The mode even 
of the mere sense-reaction has its obscurities, under cover of which 
some speak as though the re-agency were merely mechanical, and not the 
re-agency of a faculty, which, in its own lower order, is cognitive.  
Yet surely a sense-impression is not received simply like a stamp upon 
wax or a stroke on a bell.  The proper attitude under obscurities is 
neither to deny ascertainable facts, nor to assert as facts what are 
fictions.</P> 

<P>The above divisions and distinctions, even though seldom explicitly 
appealed to, are most valuable in shedding light on the matter about 
which we have now to argue; and the absence of them leaves a great 
haziness of mind, anything but conducive to the work of framing or 
appreciating arguments.</P> 

<P>4. Briefly stated, the whole proof of the present thesis will 
consist in showing that the experienced facts of sensation are 
confessedly alike with our adversaries and ourselves, and that only our 
way of accounting for them is adequate.  In other words, starting from 
the common ground of an admittedly double series in our sensations, we 
have next to show that the true account of the fact is what has been 
broadly expressed by the terms <EM>realism</EM> or <EM>dualism,</EM> 
which mean that there are <EM>two real</EM> divisions of things, "my 
body," and " bodies outside mine." Let us start with the declaration of 
what is common ground.</P> 

<P>It would be very. awkward, indeed, for us, if we found adversaries 
asserting that they have no experiences answering to our own; that 
outer and inner objects, the different personal pronouns, <EM>I, 
you,</EM> and </EM>they,</EM> are terms which correspond to no 
distinctions in their consciousness.  But it is the very complaint of 
the idealist that his admissions on these points are not recognized, 
and that he is supposed to be logically committed to an utter disregard 
of mad dogs, infuriated bulls, express trains, yawning abysses, on the 
one side; and on the other side, of good dinners, elegant dress, 
commodious lodgings, and entertaining company.  His protest is that all 
ordinary forms of speech have a meaning for him. He allows that the 
sun, on present calculation, is about ninety millions of miles off; he 
expects in about a week to complete a voyage to America and find "the 
big continent" at the end.  He would correct a child who mixed up the 
doings of Napoleon and of Wellington, and he claims to himself the 
exploits of neither: he does not at all allow that they are the 
fictions of his own fancy.  Perhaps he will go so far as to talk of a 
time a long way back in the process of evolution, when consciousness as 
yet was not. Mr. Spencer thinks the idealist has no right so to speak, 
ever.  Sully thinks he has, our view of the matter may be given later: 
at present let us turn to some examples in proof of the unanimity 
between idealists and realists as to the facts of experience for which 
an account has to be given.  Of course only the idealists need be 
quoted.</P> 

<P>Berkeley,<A HREF="#N_7_"><sup><small>{7}</small></sup></A> remarking that he can 
call up fantastic images as he likes, adds, "but when in broad daylight 
I open my eyes, it is not in my power to choose whether I shall see or 
not, or to determine what particular objects shall present themselves 
to my view." "The ideas of sense are more strong, lively, and distinct 
than those of the imagination.  They have a liveliness, a steadiness, 
order, and coherence, and are not excited at random, as those which are 
the effects of human wills often are, but in regular train and series." 
Berkeley, it is true, was only a half-hearted idealist, though, as his 
notebook shows, he had thoughts of abolishing spiritual substance among 
created things, just as he abolished material substance,- and then he 
would have become wholly an idealist.  If, however, we want a man who, 
according to his principles, ought to be the most out-and-out idealist, 
we have Berkeley's continuator, Hume: and he fully admits the contrast 
between the actual and the imaginary in our objects of thought.  
"Nature, by an absolute and uncontrollable necessity, has determined us 
to judge as well as to breathe and feel; nor can we any more forbear 
viewing certain objects in a stronger and fuller light upon account of 
their customary connexion with a present impression, than we can hinder 
ourselves from thinking as long as we are awake, or seeing the 
surrounding bodies when we turn our eyes towards them in broad 
sunshine.  Whoever has undertaken to refute the cavils of this total 
scepticism has really disputed without an antagonist, and endeavoured, 
by argument, to establish a faculty which nature has antecedently 
implanted in the mind and rendered unavoidable."<A 
HREF="#N_8_"><sup><small>{8}</small></sup></A> Passing on to a great modern 
representative of Hume, we find Mill<A HREF="#N_9_"><sup><small>{9}</small></sup></A> 
owning to an experience like ours, as we gather from what he says about 
his belief in the permanent existence of icebergs, of a piece of white 
paper, and of the city of Calcutta.  Elsewhere he distinctly recognizes 
his own bodily senses as the organs whereby he communicates with the 
external world.  "Physical objects are, of course, known to us through 
the senses.  By these channels, and not otherwise, we learn whatever we 
do learn concerning them. Without the senses we know no more of what 
they are than the senses tell us.  Thus much, in the obvious meaning of 
the words, is denied by no one, though there are thinkers who prefer to 
express their meaning in other language." The twin philosopher with 
Mill, namely, Mr. Bain,<A HREF="#N_10_"><sup><small>{10}</small></sup></A> though he 
declares the question whether there is an outer world not to be even 
intelligible, yet clearly recognizes the experiences which we call 
those of the outer world: "The perception of matter points to a 
fundamental distinction in our experience.  We are in one condition or 
attitude of mind when surveying a tree or a mountain. and in a totally 
different condition or attitude when luxuriating in warmth or suffering 
from a toothache.  The difference here indicates the greatest 
contrast." And again: "Object means (a) what calls our muscular 
energies into play as opposed to passive feelings; (b) the uniform 
connexion of definite feelings with definite energies, as opposed to 
feelings unconnected with energies: (c) what affects all minds alike, 
as opposed to what varies in different minds. . . . The greatest 
antithesis among the phenomena of our mental constitution is the 
antithesis between the active and passive." A more appropriate 
quotation still may be given from the same chapter: To say that the 
perception of matter is an ultimate, indivisible, simple fact " is as 
doubtful in itself as it is at variance with the common belief.  When 
we turn to the fact called perception, we cannot help being struck with 
the <EM>appearance</EM> at least of complexity.  There is seemingly a 
combination of a perceiving mind, a mode of activity of that mind, a 
something to be perceived -- nothing less than the whole extended 
universe.  To make out this seemingly threefold concurrence to be an 
indivisible fact, would at least demand a justifying explanation." 
Lastly, to quote the testimony of a prominent scientific man, who more 
than the common run of his brethren claims to be likewise a 
philosopher, Mr. Huxley admits that the realistic hypothesis so well 
satisfies the facts of the case that it may be true:<A 
HREF="#N_11_"><sup><small>{11}</small></sup></A> "there may be a real something which 
is the cause of our experience." This admission he unfortunately 
follows up by another admission, which shows the abyss of the 
agnosticism into which he has fallen, and to which we shall have 
repeatedly to recur afterwards, because it is such a clear declaration 
of his philosophical bankruptcy.  "For any demonstration that can be 
given to the contrary effect, the collection of perceptions which makes 
up our consciousness may be an orderly phantasmagoria, generated by the 
Ego unfolding its successive scenes on the background of the abyss of 
nothingness; as a firework, which is but cunningly arranged 
combustibles, grows from a spark into a coruscation, and from a 
coruscation into figures and words and cascades of devouring flames, 
and then vanishes into the darkness of night."</P> 

<P>This last avowal is not satisfactory: but at any rate we have the 
satisfactory result of finding a common account of the phenomena to be 
explained; and we may now go on to find proof of the manifest breakdown 
of the idealistic theory and of the manifest stability of the moderate 
realistic doctrine, when each respectively is called upon to explain 
the universally admitted facts of experience.</P> 

<P>5. It is not with the whole of idealism that we have got to do, but 
only with the part which concerns the sensible world of matter.  
However, the fundamental difficulty, on which throughout idealism is 
based, is contained in the question, how can the individual get outside 
of itself? how can thought transcend itself? how can the subject know 
anything except its own affections ?<A 
HREF="#N_12_"><sup><small>{12}</small></sup></A> In reply we have to repeat the old 
truths, that we may be certain of a fact without being acquainted with 
the how of the fact; and that "from a fact to its possibility the 
inference is valid."<A HREF="#N_13_"><sup><small>{13}</small></sup></A> At least it is 
a piece of more gratuitous dogmatism than they seem to be aware of, 
when idealists lay it down <EM>a priori,</EM> that it is a plain self-
contradiction to suppose the perception of an object, which object is 
other than the percipient. and known by him to be such.  Not that there 
is no mystery in the process : indeed there is mystery even in the 
simplest instance of what we call a transient action, as when a moving 
body sets in motion a body before at rest.  Still more is there mystery 
in the process of thought, an act at once physically immanent in the 
subject, and transient, as the scholastics say, 
<EM>intentionaliter,</EM> that is, having its term, so far as meaning 
and intelligence are concerned, something outside the subject.  The 
mystery then we allow: but at the same time we contend, that however 
mysterious, still a fact which can be established ought to be 
recognized.  In order to the establishment of the fact we have two 
points to prove: (a) that each one's senses testify to the 
<EM>existence</EM> of his own body and of bodies not his own; and (b) 
that they testify something about the <EM>nature</EM> of these 
bodies.</P> 

<P>(a) In behalf of the former point three arguments may be adduced.</P>

<P>(i.) Our adversaries each assert <EM>the existence of other 
men,</EM> and it is on this ground that we will do battle with them in 
the first instance.  Relegating all account of individual writers to a 
note in the <EM>Addenda,</EM> lest it should here perplex the course of 
an argument already sufficiently difficult in itself, we must be 
content to speak in quite general terms.  We say, then, that on the 
strength of sensible manifestations, opponents are quite unwarranted in 
their inference that "other men" besides themselves exist.  By the very 
principles of their position they are shut out from the conclusion that 
anything is truly other than their own sensations; and their pretence 
that "other men" are demonstrable while "external matter" is 
indemonstrable, can be kept up only by a delusion resting on great 
confusion of thought.  For in the end it will be seen that the 
assumption of a known "external matter" is needful, and is employed in 
the argument whereby the conclusion is drawn that there are "other 
men." A reference to Mill's view, as explained in the <EM>Addenda, 
will</EM> make this point clear.  The strength of our attack on the 
adversaries always lies in this: they assert distinctly "other men" 
with bodies like their own, and thereby they give up their own doctrine 
as to the power of the senses.</P> 

<P>After showing the inability of idealists to defend their belief in 
"other men," we may now venture upon doing what they have failed to do, 
framing upon their suggestion an argument of our own, which, while it 
is not one ordinarily used in books, is an effective demonstration of 
the validity of the senses.  The line of proof runs thus.  We certainly 
do, through our senses and the material manifestations furnished to 
them by "other men," come to a sure knowledge that these men exist.  
But this could not be, unless our senses were valid means for reaching 
the knowledge of external bodies.  Therefore our senses are such valid 
means.  The major of the syllogism can be established in a special way, 
which will leave untouched the commoner arguments that are to be 
adduced presently.  For, that we do come across other minds, is most 
clearly evidenced to us by the intellectual assistance we receive from 
them.  It would require a very foolish or a verv shameless scholar, 
seriously to maintain that all the information he receives from 
teachers and books is really as much the exclusive product of his own 
mind, as that which he ordinarily calls his original thought or 
discovery; allowing this sole difference, that the former knowledge is 
accompanied by a special feeling of derivation from outside, which is, 
after all, only a part of his own inner consciousness.  Let us think of 
our very, very wide indebtedness to other minds; how very much less 
than we are, we should have been, intellectually, had others not taught 
us orally or in writing; how very little we really know at first hand; 
and then let us try to swallow down, we might almost have called it the 
idealist joke on the subject, were it not that some idealists are 
manifestly in earnest.  We feel that we have not powers of deglutition 
for so formidable a morsel.  If then we really do come in contact with 
other minds, and draw knowledge from them, the intercommunion is 
certainly not one purely spiritual: it is through the senses and by 
means evidently material.  With our bodily senses we approach those 
bodily objects, the books of the British Museum, the Natural History 
Specimens in its Kensington offshoot, the libraries, the custodians, 
and the professors, who, as experts, help us inexperts out of many a 
difficulty.  Surely the least recognition we can pay to our kindly 
helpers is to acknowledge unreservedly their real, independent 
existence.  Mr. Huxley, in spite of his theory that idealism cannot be 
disproved, expresses himself gratified with the tokens of esteem that 
he receives from former pupils.  Now if he would goodnaturedly consider 
the impossibility of his barbouring any genuine doubt, as to whether he 
has been exercising and receiving the offices of real "altruism," or 
has simply been teaching himself under another form, and receiving from 
the pseudo-outsider compliments, which his modesty would have forbidden 
him undisguisedly to pay to himself; he might be brought to recognize 
that the existence and the actions of really "other men can be fully 
brought home as a conviction of the reason, and that idealism, in 
consequence, is exploded, not only practically, but theoretically.  He 
would retract the already quoted passage, that for aught we can 
demonstrate to the contrary, all our thinking may be so many idle 
fireworks let off by the mind against "a background of 
nothingness."</P> 

<P>Beyond a doubt, under the single category of the intellectual aids 
which we derive by our communication, through the senses, with our 
fellow-men, there lies proof positive that idealism is an insulting 
attempt to fool a man out of those faculties which are his birth-right.  
Because we are treating philosophically of the senses, we are not 
therefore to allow ourselves to be staggered "out of our five wits," by 
any phantom which a bit of sophistry may conjure up before us.  Because 
we have on the philosophic mantle, we are not, therefore, to yield up 
that sound judgment which we possess, when we are, so to speak, in our 
shirt sleeves.  In the latter condition we are reach, to fight a pretty 
vigorous battle for the reasonableness of trusting our senses; and 
there is nothing to prevent us, as philosophers, from doing the same 
stout battle. As philosophers we may affirm, what as ordinary men we 
affirm, that there is evidence from the senses, such as to warrant our 
belief in the existence of our fellow-mortals; and that in this 
conclusion is involved the wider proposition, that about the world of 
matter in general our senses can testify to its outer reality.</P> 

<P>(ii.) To pass now from the consideration of "other men," a 
consideration which our adversaries have usefully forced upon us, we 
may turn to the arguments more commonly adduced on behalf of the senses 
by standard authors.<A HREF="#N_14_"><sup><small>{14}</small></sup></A> Each one who 
is unburdened by Kantian views as to space and time, may formulate to 
himself this argument in some such shape as the following: I can verify 
for myself, as an explorer, the existence of my own extended body, of 
definite shape and size.  At least by repetition and comparison of 
experiences from different senses, I can become aware of my several 
sentient organs; of one sensation as being peculiar to one inlet, and 
another to another; of sights entering in at places different from the 
places where sounds enter.  I can feel the double sense of contact, 
that of touching and being touched, when I place my right hand upon my 
left, and I can contrast this duplex sensation with the single 
sensation given by putting either hand upon the table.  Gradually, if 
not at once, I can explore the limits of my sentient body.  I find this 
body of mine at the same time brought into relation with other bodies, 
in such sort that the only rational interpretation of the situation is 
to say, these bodies are really not mine.  I touch them and feel their 
resistance to my energies, but invariably without the double sense of 
touch or resistance which I usually have when it is one part against 
another part of my own body that I oppose.  Conviction is, in a million 
instances, brought home to me that I am passively sentient, not of 
course with a pure passivity, under many outside influences -- 
influences which I cannot have at will, or carry about with me, or vary 
with the same degree of control which I have over a mere train of 
subjectively originated imaginations.  The control in the latter case 
is indeed far from absolute, but at least it is perceptibly something.  
Nor can I persuade myself, on Hume's suggestion, to get over the 
difference between real and imaginary objects by attributing it only to 
a greater and less degree of subjective liveliness; for I have the 
means, while reason lasts, of detecting even very lively fantasies to 
be only fantasies.</P> 

<P>So might a common man argue, and validly.  It is because he so 
reasons that he is apt to receive the often inculcated lesson of 
scientific men, like Mr. Huxley, that about physical facts we must 
consult outer nature, and not try to evolve them from our inner 
consciousness.  If we want personally to explore the home habits of the 
Polar bear, we must join a Polar expedition, which will mean a great 
deal more than the idea of a tedious and perilous voyage preceding the 
idea of finding what we seek. Yet according to strict idealists this is 
all thatis meant.  For instance, Professor Huxley<sup><small><a href="#n_15">{15}</a></small></sup> that the analysis 
of the proposition, "Brain produces thought," "amounts to the following 
whenever those states of consciousness which are called sensation, 
motion, or thought, come into existence, complete investigation will 
show good reason for the belief that they are preceded by those other 
phenomena of consciousness to which we gave the names of matter and 
motion." As the Professor cannot mean that we always think of matter 
and motion before we think of consciousness, he has no right to call 
the cerebral motion which, on thetheory of brain producing thought, 
would be the antecedent of consciousness, by the name of a "phenomenon 
of consciousness." How can that antecedent be the phenomenal antecedent 
in consciousness which in consciousness does not antecede the 
result?</P> 

<P>The main difficulty brought against this, which we have styled "the 
ordinary argument" for realism, is made to rest on impossible theories 
about the origin of the notion <EM>extension</EM> or <EM>outness.</EM>  
It is asserted that <EM>local outness</EM> is not given simply by the 
consciousness of one thought being other than a preceding thought, and 
then great labour is expended to develop externality in space out of 
succession in sentient states.  These bugbears set up by a bad 
psychology must be encountered in the psychological treatise; but we 
in our own treatise at least are justified in claiming, on the strength 
of natural evidence, a clear idea of outness in space as derived 
through our sensitive experience.  We need no more for the purposes of 
the line of proofjust brought to an end.</P> 

<P>(iii.) It is not necessary to develop further the argument against 
idealism and for realism as furnishing the genuine account of those 
experienced differences between inner and outer bodies, which all 
parties admit, but some confirmation of what has been urged may be 
borrowed from Professor Tait's idea, that the great proof of external 
reality is the scientific truth that matter can neither be created nor 
annihilated.  On idealist principles this proposition might still be 
held, but it would have very little value.  As soon as the scientific 
man was persuaded that matter was only the objective side of his ideas, 
without ascertainable independent existence, he would care very little 
about its increase or decrease: and might even claim to increase and 
decrease it at will, at least under certain conditions.</P> 

<P>Another confirmation, suggested by Mr. Spencer, and allowed by Mr. 
Balfour, but disallowed by Mr. Sully, lies in the assertion, that "if 
idealism is true, then evolution is a dream." For evolution supposes an 
indefinitely long period, during which there was no consciousness in 
the universe.  Such a universe, as an existence, cannot have been 
ideal, and cannot be affirmed now by the idealist: for it would once 
have been a universe out of all human thought, which Mr. Bain, on his 
principles, rightly concludes to be a "manifest contradiction."</P> 

<P>(b) Some, conceding to us all which so far we have been pressing to 
prove, but not all we have actually proved, would bid us stop short 
here; they admit that we have evidence for predicating the bare 
<EM>existence</EM> of bodies outside our own, but nothing more; we can 
say nothing of their <EM>attributes</EM> or <EM>nature.</EM> Kant, in 
some passages, but not in all, takes up exactly this position, and 
Schopenhauer declares "he must be abandoned by all the gods who 
imagines that there exists outside of us a real world of objects 
corresponding to our representations."</P> 

<P>At this juncture the distinction is of some use between what are 
called primary and secondary qualities, though it is not to be pushed 
to excess, as though any sensible quality could be perceived as quite 
out of all relation to sense.  We may contrast the relations we affirm 
between the object and the organism of the subject, with the relations 
we affirm between one object and another.  Whether sugar is sweet, 
ginger hot, and aloes bitter, depends upon the subject, and would 
change with a possible change of subject; but no change of the 
subject's faculties could validly report that St. Paul's would go 
inside the smallest shop in Paternoster Row, and that a strip of 
carpet, which we have in a corner of the room, would cover the whole 
floor.  It is true enough that all objects, whether primary or 
secondary qualities, affect our senses relatively to the structure of 
our organs; but not only can there be no knowledge of relations without 
some knowledge of the absolute terms which are related, but in 
asserting one class of relations between external bodies, we assert 
that which would not change with a change of our organism, though this 
latter change might increase or decrease our perception of the outer 
facts.  That a whale is larger than a whiting does not depend on any 
percipient organism, but is true for any organism that can perceive 
it.</P> 

<P>Again, when we think of some well-established chemical analysis, for 
example, the resolution of water into two gases, we ask ourselves, is 
there no real insight into the nature of things here? Is physical 
science so devoid of objective reality as to tell us nothing of "things 
themselves," in the rational meaning of that phrase? Is the resistance 
we directly encounter from external objects nothing proper to the 
objects themselves? Is it a fact that we can regard it only under the 
false analogy of a will-power, never as a material power? It is 
suicidal in the idealist to quote, as he does, the instances of light 
and heat, and to argue his case with an air of triumph, from the fact 
that vibrations of a fluid medium are quite unlike the sensations of 
sight and hearing.  He forgets that it has been by the senses that the 
vibrations have been discovered, and that if the scientific result is 
worth anything, it proves the ability of the senses to give us 
information about facts as they are in external nature.  To urge in 
replv that these facts are, for us, only as known bv us, not as 
existing out of relation to all knowledge, is futile; for this does not 
prove that we cannot know objects as they really are.  We do not know 
all about them, but that we never claimed to know; at least we know 
something, and that contradicts idealism.</P> 

<P>In saying that our knowledge is a compound of subjective and 
objective elements inextricably combined, adversaries make the mistake 
of going simply on the analogy of a chemical composition.<sup><small><a href="#n_16">{16}</a></small></sup> Water is 
neither oxygen nor hydrogen, being a chemical compound of the two.  But 
thought is not a chemical compound, having for its constituents object 
and subject.  Materially the known object has not to be shot into the 
mind and fused with it.  The reaction of mind after the stimulation of 
the senses, is not any kind of a reaction, but a definite, most 
peculiar, and most exalted one.  And the argument which urges that no 
knowledge attains to reality as it is, because all is relative, is so 
radically false, that it includes not only finite minds, but all minds, 
even the Divine, and denies to God Himself an absolute knowledge. Its 
perspicacious and consistent advocates boldly affirm, that from its 
very nature no knowledge can be absolute, attaining to the thing as it 
is; knowledge must be relative, must transfigure its object, must mix 
up elements or forms of self with elements or forms of non-self.  No 
such <EM>a priori</EM> reasonings are valid.  There is no demonstration 
that even a finite faculty must so transfer its own conditions to 
objects as known by it, that it can know nothing rightly.  The only 
point demonstrated is, that a finite faculty will have many 
limitations, because of its imperfection; but that knowledge, as such, 
cannot in any intellect be absolute and complete, is the merest piece 
of perverse dogmatism, without the shadow of a proof.  Lay bare the 
falseness of an analogy between knowledge and chemical combination, and 
all argument for the dogma collapses.</P> 

<P>Let us end with an illustration from one of the primary qualities of 
body, impenetrability, A poor prisoner in Newgate does not beat idly 
against the walls of his cell, like a bird just caged.  For 
intellectually he perceives that huge blocks of masonry are hopeless 
obstacles; that they bar the progress of a man who would walk through 
them.  Immoveably they occupy the space where they now are, and in the 
fact that two different material bodies cannot naturally<sup><small><a href="#n_17">{17}</a></small></sup> occupy 
together identically the same space, consists the familiar property of 
impenetrability.  So thinks the prisoner.  But Mr. Huxley, who is at 
large in the world, solemnly tells it, that, "if I say that 
impenetrability is a property of matter, all that I can really mean is, 
that the consciousness I call extension and the consciousness I call 
resistance, inevitably accompany one other." We cannot think of 
impenetrability without consciousness; but all the same we can know 
impenetrability to be a real property found in unconscious matter, and 
belonging to it, not because of our consciousness.</P> 

<P>While maintaining that our senses enable us to form some correct 
judgments about matter and its properties, we fully admit how far from 
exhaustive is our knowledge.  Take for example the properties of 
extension in space and succession in time.  A Catholic least of all 
would arrogate to himself, on these points, a comprehensive 
acquaintance; for some of the mysteries of his faith warn him to the 
contrary.  He easily admits these to involve no clear impossibilities; 
for he easily admits his own ignorance, and the possibility of that 
being brought about preternaturally, which naturally would not be. But 
he does not, on that account, easily forego his own knowledge of 
simpler truths about the material universe, so long as matter is left 
in those normal conditions with which he ran familiarize himself.</P> 

<P>6. Our argument, which has been long rather than abstruse, calling 
for patience rather than for extraordinary penetration, may now be 
summarized.  In the phenomena of sense-perception rival schools are 
substantially agreed about the conscious experiences of which an 
account has to be rendered.  Pure idealists, on their own principles, 
cannot use sensible manifestations to make certain of the existence of 
other men like themselves; they assert these "other men," but 
inconsistently, and at the price of renouncing their theory, and coming 
over to our side.  Contrariwise we realists find a strong argument for 
our doctrine in finding how enormous is the help we receive from our 
fellows through the aid of the senses.  Again, idealists allow, but do 
not account for the general contrast between sensations of self and 
sensations stimulated by bodies outside self: whereas we render a 
rational interpretation of the antithesis -- an interpretation so 
rational that Mr. Bain himself, writing in <EM>Mind,</EM> can 
condescend to say: "Every one of us readily admits that our impressions 
are transient things; yet they come up again with astonishing 
regularity in the appropriate situations; <EM>and the easiest way of 
figuring to ourselves this regularity is to suppose a permanent 
something, with all its parts well knit together, so as to repeat our 
ocnscious state with a fixity that we actually find. This is ordinary 
realism</EM> The scientific doctrine of the constancy of the sum total 
of matter, and the evolutionary hypothesis, accordinto which, for a 
long time, there was no conscious existence in the material universe, 
are conceptions which are badly in accord with idealism, but 
intelligible to realism, even when the realist does not believe that 
all life has been developed by the mere self-organization of dead 
matter. Moreover, not only have we proof of the existence of our own 
and other bodies, but likewise it is clear that we know something about 
their nature and their attributes.  It would be to know something, if 
we could predicate of them only the secondary qualities, as that sugar 
is an object exciting a sweet taste in the palate, and that vinegar 
rouses an acid feeling; but we can go further and know the primary and 
more intellectual qualities; for instance, we know about extended space 
such truths as geometry teaches, and we know about motion such laws as 
help to form the science of mechanics.  The judgment may at times err 
in its interpretation of the object which is exciting a sensation, but 
the senses themselves always report what, under the circumstances, they 
ought to report; and no sensation, as such, can be false.  Under the 
normal condition of the faculties, there is no sensation which is not, 
of its own nature, calculated to give some information about the 
material world.  A diseased state of organism may baffle the 
understanding; but it is beyond cavil that there is a state of organism 
which is normal, and which we have a right to assume as our standard 
for testing the validity of the senses.  Thus, an examination of the 
whole case leads to the conclusion, that the common belief in the 
testimony of the senses is well within the bounds of reasonable 
procedure; and that, in doing what he cannot help as regards trust in 
his senses, man is not being driven by a blind instinct, but is acting 
according to his intelligent nature. The instincts of a blind nature 
are blind; but the instincts of an intelligent nature may often be 
shown to be intelligent.  It is so with our use of the senses.</P> 

<P>ADDENDA.</P>

<P>(1) We omitted (with a view to avoiding distraction from the main 
argument) any details as to the way in which our opponents come to the 
assertion of "other men" beside themselves; these may now be supplied.  
The substance of Mill's view is contained in the following passage:<sup><small><a href="#n_a">{a}</a></small></sup> 
"I am aware of a group of Permanent Possibilities of Sensation which I 
call my body, and which my experience shows to be a universal condition 
of every part of my thread of consciousness.  And I am also aware of a 
great number of other groups, resembling the one I call my body, but 
which have no connexion, such as that has, with the remainder of my 
thread of consciousness.  This disposes me to draw an inductive 
inference, that other groups are connected with other threads of 
consciousness, as mine is with my own.  If the evidence stopped here 
the inference would be but an hypothesis, reaching only to the inferior 
degree of inductive evidence called analogy.  The evidence, however, 
does not stop here: for having made the supposition that real feelings, 
though not experienced by myself, lie behind these phenomena of my own 
consciousness, which from the resemblance to my own body I call 
<EM>other human bodies,</EM> I find that my subsequent consciousness 
presents these very sensations of speech heard, of movements and other 
outward demeanour seen, and so forth, which being the effects or 
consequences of actual feeling in my own case, I should expect to 
follow upon those other hypothetical feelings, if they really existed: 
and thus the hypothesis is verified.  <EM>It is thus Proved inductively 
that there is a sphere beyond my consciousness,</EM> that there are 
<EM>other consciousnesses</EM> beyond it.  There exists no parallel 
evidence in regard to matter."</P> 

<P>Now the fact is, that Mill proves his "other consciousnesses" only 
on the tacit assumption of "other matter:" and to real 
<EM>otherness</EM> in either department he can never logically attain.  
For logically he has no right to pass beyond the limits of subjective 
idealism.  Mr. Balfour<sup><small><a href="#n_b">{b}</a></small></sup> is positive in the assertion that "there can 
be no doubt that Mill considered himself an idealist" and certainly he 
succeeded in establishing nothing above an idealistic existence for his 
"possibilities of sensation," however boldly, after denying the reality 
of substance and of efficient causality, he might arrogate to his 
"possibilities" both substance and efficient powers.  It is part of the 
want of clear consistency in the man<sup><small><a href="#n_c">{c}</a></small></sup> to account for physical changes 
by "one group of possibilities of sensation modifying another such 
group)" whilst he also taught ,that all we are conscious of may be 
accounted for without supposing that we perceive matter by our senses: 
and that the notion and belief may have come to us by the laws of our 
constitution, without their being a revelation of any objective 
reality:" and that "the <EM>non ego</EM> altogether may be a mode in 
which the mind represents to itself the possible modifications of the 
<EM>ego</EM>." Again he asks: 'How do I know that magnitude is not 
exclusively a property of our sensations?" And he holds that we do not 
know whether, as affirmed of Matter itself, the word divisible has any 
meaning.  Lastly, in controversy with Mr. Spencer,<sup><small><a href="#n_d">{d}</a></small></sup> he says: "Neither 
of us, if I understand Mr. Spencer's opinion arigbt, believe an 
attribute to be a real thing possessed of objective existence; we 
believe it to be <EM>a particular mode of naming our sensations,</EM> 
or <EM>our expectations of sensation,</EM> wben looked at in the 
relation of an external object which excites them: "yet so that these 
so-called "exciting objects" must not be considered either as 
substances, or as efficient causes, or as something really external and 
independent.</P> 

<P>Mill being thus in many ways committed to idealism, cannot argue the 
existence of "other consciousnesses" or "other men," from the data of 
their external manifestations: he is wholly shut out from every notion 
of real "otherness." And yet that his argument does ultimately fall 
back on the inference of human agents from human activities, other than 
his own but like his own, will again appear, if we add a concluding 
specimen of his doctrine.<sup><small><a href="#n_e">{e}</a></small></sup> "By what evidence do I know that the 
walking and speaking figures which I see and hear, have sensations and 
thoughts -- in other words, possess minds? I conclude that other beings 
have feelings like me, because first, they have bodies like me; and 
secondly, because they exhibit acts and other outward signs, which in 
my own case I know to be caused by feelings." If Mill had once shown us 
how he arrived at the <EM>otherness</EM> of the manifestations, we 
could allow him the <EM>otherness</EM> of the human agents; but 
<EM>otherness</EM> is wholly denied to his principles.</P> 

<P>Perhaps what Professor Clifford says will help to explain why Mill 
insisted so much on "other consciousnesses," namely, that while 
"material objects" may be spoken of as "the other side of my 
consciousness," it is absurd to speak of "other consciousnesses" as 
only "the other side of my consciousness." To signalize this special 
character, Clifford calls "other consciousnesses," not objects, but 
<EM>ejects,</EM> for they must be projected outside of self -- "they 
cannot be a group of my feelings persisting as a group." As to the 
difficulty of asserting any "otherness" beyond his own thinking self, 
Clifford thinks he need not waste time over considering a step which 
his ancestors took for him long ago.</P> 

<P>M. Taine avowedly tries to lend a helping hand to Mill for the 
purpose of securing a little more reality to external objects than his 
friend's theory can afford.  He allows that to us a stone is "a more 
or less elaborate extract from our sensations;" but further, "we may 
upon authentic evidence refer to things some of those more or less 
transformed and reduced materials, <EM>and attribute to such things a 
distinct existence without us,</EM> analogous to that which they have 
within.  In this respect a stone is a being as real and as complete, as 
distinct from us, as any particular man.  By this addition to the 
theory of Mill and Bain, we restore to bodies an actual existence, 
independent of our existence."</P> 

<P>It is instructive to see idealists trying in vain to get of the 
position called solipsism," or belief in self alone.  Especially they 
feel that "it is not good for man to be alone," and so they labour 
strenuously to justify their assertion of "other men" besides 
themselves; but always with the result of violating their own 
idealistic principles.</P> 

<P>(2) On the subject of primary and secondary qualities of body, 
Hamilton teaches that we regard objects sometimes "as they are in 
themselves," sometimes "as they affect us," and sometimes in a half-
and-half way: these last qualities he calls secundo-primary.  For 
Hamilton's three terms others substitute mathematical, mechanical, and 
physiological properties; while Mr. Spencer prefers to use, as almost 
equivalent terms, statical, dynamical, and stato-dynamical.</P> 

<P>(3) Though some regard materialism as the contrary extreme of 
idealism, Mr. Huxley is constant in his theory that an idealist may be 
a materialist, though he himself refuses to be either.  Let us extend 
one of the quotations given in the text "If we analyze the proposition 
that all mental phenomena are the effects or products of material 
phenomena, all that materialism means amounts to this, that whenever 
these states of consciousness which we call sensations, or emotions, or 
thought, come into existence, complete investigation will show good 
reason for the belief, that they are preceded by other phenomena, to 
which we give the names of matter and motion.  All material change 
appears in the long run to be modes of motion; but our knowledge of 
motion is nothing but that of a change in the places and order of our 
sensations: just as our knowledge of matter is restricted to those 
feelings of which we assume it to be the cause."<sup><small><a href="#n_f">{f}</a></small></sup> This comes to 
little more than the jejune announcement, that if matter be reduced to 
idealistic dimensions then materialism and idealism are reconciled.  
But how does this square with the evolutionary hypothesis that ideas, 
for a long time, did not uppear, but supervened, in comparatively 
recent times, on a world of unconscious matter, which cannot be reduced 
to feelings?</P> 

<P>(4) The special form of idealism introduced by Berkeley has so few 
patrons that it is not necessary to labour much in its refutation.  He 
supposed that all the sensible impressions, which we call material, 
were due, not to the action of any independent matter, but to the 
immediate agency of God.  With regard to external bodies the difficulty 
of the theory is somewhat less; but with regard to our own bodies, it 
would be a task even to Omnipotence to make us feel ourselves as 
sentient, extended beings, if all the while we were pure spirits, of an 
essentially unextended nature.  Moreover, given such a God as Berkeley 
rightly admitted, his theory as regards bodies other than our own, is 
dishonourable to the Creator rather than, as it alms at being, 
honourable.  For an adequate reason, and after a sufficient warning, 
God may permit such deceptions as may take place through the senses, 
because of the mystery of the Blessed Eucharist, on the explanation 
given of it by Catholic theology; but He could not consistently with 
wisdom and truthfulness, arrange a wholesale system of delusion, such 
as only a Berkeley here and there would detect, while the mass of 
mankind were inevitably being duped.  Few as have been Berkeley's 
followers, some of our modern writers in this country have an affinity 
to him, as, for example, Professors Green and Caird.  One of these 
talks much about finite minds "becoming the vehicle of an eternal 
complete consciousness," which is "a consciousness operative throughout 
our successive acquirements, and realizing itself through them," "an 
eternal consciousness operative in us to produce the gradual 
development of our knowledge." These are some of Green's phrases, while 
Professor Caird's expressions are such as these: "The data of sense are 
taken out of their mere singularity of feelings and made elements in a 
universal consciousness: that is, they are related to a consciousness 
which the individual has not, as a mere individual, but as a universal 
subject of knowledge.  Only in relation to such a consciousness can an 
individual know himself or any other individual as such." But, perhaps, 
it is Ferrier who most of all approaches to Berkeley.  Ferrier, denying 
that matter <EM>per se</EM> has any meaning, makes the perception of 
matter the ultimate, indivisible unit of knowledge.  He wholly rejects 
the analysis into perception as subjective, and matter as objective; he 
declares the subjective element to be <EM>our apprehension,</EM> that 
we perceive matter, and the objective element to be <EM>our perception 
of matter.</EM> Still, he will not allow that the perception of matter 
is a mere modification of our own minds: he will not lapse into 
subjective idealism.  And it is thus he guards himself against this 
doctrine: "Our primitive conviction is, that the perception of matter 
is not, either wholly or in part, a condition of the human soul; is not 
bounded in any direction by the narrow limits of our intellectual span; 
but that it 'dwells apart,' a mighty and independent system, a city 
filled up and upheld by the everlasting God.  Who told us that we were 
placed in a world composed of matter, and not <EM>that we were let down 
at once into a universe composed of</EM> external perceptions of 
matter, that were beforehand and from all eternity, and into which we, 
the creatures of a day, are merely allowed to participate by the 
gracious Power to whom they really appertain? When a man consults his 
own nature in an impartial spirit, he inevitably finds that his 
generous belief in the existence of matter, is not a belief in the 
independent existence of matter <EM>per se,</EM> but is a belief in 
<EM>the independent existence, of the perception of matter, which he is 
for a time participating in.</EM> The very last thing which he 
naturally believes in is, that the perception is a state of his own 
mind, and that the matter is something different from it, and exists 
apart <EM>in natura rerum.</EM>  It is the perception of matter, and 
not matter <EM>per se,</EM> which is the kind of matter in the 
independent and permanent existence of which man reposes his belief.  
This theory of perception is a doctrine of pure intuitionism: it steers 
clear of all the perplexities of representationism."<sup><small><a href="#n_g">{g}</a></small></sup> Ferrier's great 
point of contention is that matter detached from thought is a delusion; 
for in pretending to detach it we are all the while thinking about it.  
It is like pretending to think ourselves annihilated; we find ourselves 
contemplating the condition; that is, we reintroduce the self we make 
show of abolishing.  It is a simple answer to say, that though we can 
know matter only so far as it is an object of our ideas, yet we can 
know that this matter with certain properties has an existence outside 
our mind.  There is no contradiction in the geologist affirming, Had I 
never discovered it, the fact would still have been, that this rock was 
scoured and striated by glacial action thousands of years ago.</P> 

<P>(5) The very fact of having tried to argue out the validity of the 
senses is a confession that the result may be reached mediately; but 
this leaves untouched a further question, whether we have any primarily 
immediate perception of a material world as external, that is, whether 
we have any primary intuition of the outness of an object which we 
perceive, or whether externality at first can be reached only as a 
matter of inference.  In point of fact, the process of ratiocination is 
so thoroughly a case of repeated and combined judgments, that the 
distinction put between the two acts, judgment and ratiocination, by 
logicians is not so radical as some suppose.  We judge and judge again, 
and put our judgments together, but it is the same intellect which is 
at work throughout.  Now every one will admit that in our present 
condition of experience we can in some cases immediately judge of 
externality; and every one will admit that the full reflex distinction 
between outer and inner world, was not made by the child without 
several repetitions of acts.  So much being settled, we may leave it to 
psychologists to push further the investigation whether it is necessary 
to assume an immediate intuition of the externality of the sense-world, 
or whether the knowledge of this rests on a spontaneous inference as to 
the origin of some of our bodily affections -- an inference so 
spontaneous that it is taken for immediate perception.  All sensations 
are bodily affections, and the inferential school say that it is only 
by argument that we can, in some of these affections, detect an outer 
cause; while the intuitive school declare that this process cannot have 
begun in argument, without an immediate perception.  Outside the sense-
world and in relation to metaphysical truths, it is certain that we 
have immediate intuitions of principles which we at once see to be 
objective and independent of ourselves; but how the case stands as 
regards the perception of the outer world of sense, gives rise to 
dispute among philosophers.</P> 

<P>(6) Another psychological difficulty is also involved in our present 
inquiry.  The passage from the image in the sensitive imagination to 
the idea in the mind is an obscure problem.  The mind does not gaze 
upon the sensitive representation and consciously copy it.  We are 
safe, however, in affirming, though the affirmation hardly amounts to 
an explanation, that because of the harmonious working of the faculties 
in a being whose author is all-skilful, when the sense image is duly 
present, the intellect has the power to produce its own corresponding 
image.  The harmony is as natural, as certain, and as little ultimately 
explicable as the correlation of growth in the body, as the adaptation 
of bodily functions <EM>inter se,</EM> and as any symmetrical 
arrangement of organic parts; whilst, however, what we call nature has 
credit for so much, education must step in and take a large share in 
the formation of our power to perceive by the senses.  Our education 
began so early, and has been so continuous and gradual, that we are apt 
to overlook the fact.  It requires almost a case of congenital cataract 
cured in later life, to bring home,to us the need which the eye has of 
being trained to do its work.  Most of our educated sense-perceptions 
are such, that what is actually, here and now, presented, is a small 
fraction of the whole, which is filled up by association or inference.  
Whatever revelations have been made by Wheatstone's ingenious 
contrivances for producing ocular illusions, by means of familiar 
effects under unfamiliar circumstances, all these we must readily 
acknowledge, without any fear for the truth of our main proposition 
that the senses are, in their own order, veracious.</P> 

<P>(7) There is a deceptiveness about some authors who seem, in places, 
to agree with our realism, and yet do not.  Thus Mr. Spencer argues for 
realism, and we may adopt some of his arguments.  But a further 
knowledge of his system tells us that he reduces the really distinct 
phenomena of self and not-self to a basis in "one Unknowable Reality;" 
and others who do not explicitly make this final reduction, at least 
allow its probability.  This is called "Monism," the doctrine that all 
manifestations, however different, are manifestations of but one 
underlying Entity; and the opposite doctrine is called, with less 
propriety, Dualism, which means that self and not-self are really 
distinct existences, the non-self being, of course, a congeries of many 
existences.  The doctrine maintained in this volume is clearly 
dualistic -- an explicit statement which may seem needless.  But any 
one who has had experience of the difficulty of trying to put together 
all the various declarations of an author, for example, like Lewes, 
will feel thankful to a writer who will declare undisguisedly where he 
stands.</P> 

<P>(8) Where Monism makes itself most awkwardly felt, is in the 
distinction between man and man.  Probably Mr. Spurgeon does not more 
strongly feel that he is really not Mr. Huxley, than Mr. Huxley feels 
that he is not Mr. Spurgeon; and yet, if they are both manifestations 
of one "ultimate unknowable reality," the identification between them 
is closer than they might like.  As we saw above, those who are 
idealists, or who admit idealism as possibly true, do not satisfy us 
that they have sufficiently applied their theory to the distinction 
between themselves and other men.  They are far too apt to assume this 
distinction, and to argue only for the common nature of the distinct 
individuals.  Thus Professor Clifford says: "I have absolutely no means 
of perceiving your mind.  I judge by analogy that it exists, and the 
instinct which leads me to come to that conclusion is the social 
instinct, as it has been formed in me by generations during which men 
have lived together; and they could not have lived together, unless 
they had gone upon that supposition." Similarly Mr. Huxley is intent 
mainly on the analogy between individuals, not on vindicating, 
according to his own principles, the real difference between individual 
and individual: "It is impossible absolutely to prove the presence or 
absence of consciousness in anything but one's own brain, though by 
analogy we are justified in assuming its existence in other men." He 
admits that he cannot be absolutely certain of any "otherness" beyond 
his own thougbts.</P> 

<P>(9) We have taken as our standard the healthy condition of the 
senses; and without denying to Dr. Maudsley the use of pathological 
cases, yet we may dissent from the prominence which he gives to them.  
His professional dealing with so many abnormal specimens of humanity, 
seems to have given him an unfair opinion of the race in general, or of 
the average man; and in reading his books it is useful to bear this 
fact constantly in mind.</P>

<EM>per se.</EM> The thing without us, resolved into its elements,

to say that the "otherness" of bodies loses its objective reality, if 
with Kant we make space not something, in our sense of the word,

rests not on difference in space, but on the fact that <EM>this</EM>
